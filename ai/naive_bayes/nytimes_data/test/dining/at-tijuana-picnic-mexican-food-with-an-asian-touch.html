Headliner  TIJUANA PICNIC Huy Chi Le, Jon Neidich and Jean-Marc Houmard, who are involved in Indochine and Acme, are trying their hands at yet another cuisine, Mexican. “We wanted to do something fun and casual to attract a younger crowd,” Mr. Houmard said. Their brand of Mexican delivers Asian seasonings, a natural for the chef Alex Lopez, who is Mexican and worked at Kittichai. “We saw inventive Mexican starting to happen,” Mr. Houmard said. The menu features mash-ups like duck wings with Asian spices, shrimp tempura tacos with fermented black beans, pork neck marinated in coconut milk and five-spice churros with yuzu and dulce de leche. The space, on two levels, features communal tables and shiny wood paneling.
