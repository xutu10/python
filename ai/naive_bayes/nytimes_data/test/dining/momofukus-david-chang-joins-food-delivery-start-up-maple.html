The options for people who have no time to cook and don’t want to go out to eat every night can be disappointing. A group of entrepreneurs, including  The secret, the group says, is technology. The partners, along with Mr. Chang, are Caleb Merkl, Akshay Navle and William Gaybrick, all of whom have experience in delivery, mobile technology and finance.

Algorithms that efficiently work out who orders what and where, and how to fulfill the orders, will be part of the system. Mr. Merkl said that Mr. Chang was enthusiastic from the beginning and that Momofuku became one of the investors. Maple’s initial funding is $4 million. Mr. Chang is the chief culinary officer, and he will enlist the expertise of other New York chefs, along with food suppliers like farmers, to create the menus. Maple’s menus will change daily.

Customers will place orders using an app. Food from a commissary kitchen will, according to the plans, arrive on their doorsteps fast, fresh and hot. “Our goal is 15 minutes,” Mr. Merkl said. That sounds like a pipe dream in Manhattan, where 15 minutes may get you from Midtown to 14th Street without traffic. “Our delivery area will be incredibly tight,” he said. Depending on the response from potential customers, they will decide where to locate their kitchens, which could number from 15 to 30.
