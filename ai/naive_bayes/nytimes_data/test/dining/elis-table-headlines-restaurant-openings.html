Headliner ELI’S TABLE After suggesting for years that he was going to renovate Taste, the restaurant in his Third Avenue market, Eli Zabar has finally delivered. He has also renamed it. The new chef, John Carr, who was at Sfoglia, works with Montezuma Garcia, a veteran of Taste, preparing dishes like porchetta sliders, artichoke salad, rib-eye for two and a baked apple the size of a softball, with many of the ingredients coming from Mr. Zabar’s stores and his rooftop farm. Randall Restiano has organized the wine list, which features mostly Burgundies and wines from Piedmont, along with small Champagne houses. The restaurant, a nicely upholstered space, was designed by Richard Lewis, and features a mural highlighting Burgundy wineries. Wine prices start just north of $30 for fair value, like a Daniel-Etienne Defaix Chablis Vieilles Vignes for $65 (just about double retail). Some wines have been drawn from Mr. Zabar’s personal collection of 16,000 bottles.
