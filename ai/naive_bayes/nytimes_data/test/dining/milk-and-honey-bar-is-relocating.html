Milk & Honey, the Cocktail Bar, Is Relocating
Milk & Honey, which opened as a Lower East Side speakeasy in 2000, is being forced to relocate.

Milk & Honey 2.0 lasted less than two years. The  It is being forced to leave because of a demolition clause in its lease, Sasha Petraske, who founded the bar nearly 15 years ago, wrote in an email. The bar’s last day at its current location is scheduled to be Oct. 25. Mr. Petraske said he learned six months ago that he would have to relocate, and he had hoped to find a new home before time ran out. If that search concludes as he intends, the third version of the bar will look a lot more like the original Milk & Honey than its grown-up, uptown version — that is, tiny and (very likely) hard to get into. “We hope to move the venue back to its original size, somewhere downtown, hopefully opening in February,” he said. Mr. Petraske said the reversal of fortune came as a surprise; he had thought he would be doing business on 23rd Street for some time. The 10-year lease he signed contained a clause that the building could be demolished if sold, he said. But Mr. Petraske was confident that would not happen because the Ring family, which owned 14 properties around the city, had held on to their buildings for many years. In 2013, however, the family sold all their properties to Extell Development Company, and Milk & Honey found itself on the brink of homelessness. The bar is the only tenant left at 30 East 23rd Street. Milk & Honey opened in a narrow, sign-less storefront on Eldridge Street on the first day of 2000. It seated just over 20 people, had no menu and was accessible only through a hard-to-decipher reservation policy. Its laserlike focus on precisely prepared classic cocktails, polished service and a certain studied decorum was subsequently adopted by bars around the world. A London satellite opened in 2002.
