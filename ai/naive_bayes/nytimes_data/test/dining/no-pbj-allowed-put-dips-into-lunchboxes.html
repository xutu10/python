No PB&J Allowed? Put Dips Into Lunchboxes
If a child’s school bans nut-based foods, dips provide a delivery system for vegetables.

Looking for ideas for what to pack in your child’s lunchbox? Melissa Clark will answer readers’ questions and share lunch tips in a Facebook chat on Friday, Sept. 5, at 1 p.m. Eastern time on  Before I became a mom, I assumed I’d follow the sandwich model when it came to school lunches. I’d pack my daughter inventive variations on the childhood favorites I used to tote to class when I was a kid, and she’d happily gobble them up. But like many things involving motherhood, I was dead wrong. My 5-year-old, Dahlia, won’t eat any sandwiches except peanut butter and jelly, which are sadly forbidden in her nut-free school. Enter my new lunchbox plan: Leave out the sandwiches, put in the dips. Not only do most children love dips, but serving them is a good way to persuade your small ones to eat their vegetables by using them as conveyances. Many dips can be made a few days ahead, and they require less last-minute work than sandwiches. You can scoop them into little containers, stack them up in your fridge and throw them into lunchboxes as you’re racing around pre-caffeine. The two things I tried to do were to pack them with enough protein to make them appropriately sustaining without using nut butters or tahini, and to make them adult-friendly enough to nibble on myself when I needed a snack. Yogurt, beans, tofu and cream cheese made the protein part a cinch. All of these substances are soft and mild enough to purée as a base, and easy to flavor in all kinds of ways. The thing here is to know your children and what they do and don’t like. Dahlia has no problem with dark green bits, so I added basil to a luscious yogurt avocado dip, spiked with lime juice and a touch of honey. But you can leave out the herb if you’d rather. One thing Dahlia won’t even touch is a pimento. So for a pepperless play on pimento cheese, I mixed grated Cheddar with mayonnaise and cream cheese and flavored it with scallion for brightness and orange juice for a mild sweetness. Dahlia ate hers on cucumber slices while I spiked the rest with hot sauce and served it to my grown-up friends with cocktails. We always keep bags of frozen edamame on hand to snack on like popcorn, so puréeing it into a creamy dip with tofu seemed like a natural way to use the legumes. Dahlia dipped rice crackers into hers while I plopped mine on brown rice as part of a grain bowl for dinner. Of course, one of my anxieties is that once school starts, the dips she ate at home will be rejected when packed into her lunchbox. Let’s just hope that in this case, too, I’m dead wrong.
