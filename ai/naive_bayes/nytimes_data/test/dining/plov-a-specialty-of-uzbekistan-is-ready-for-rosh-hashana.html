Plov, a Specialty of Uzbekistan, Is Ready for Rosh Hashana
Plov, a rice dish cooked with beef, onions, carrots and cumin seeds, is beloved as the national dish of Uzbekistan, and is fitting for tables on Rosh Hashana.

On a quiet street in Rego Park, Queens, sits the small clapboard house of Aron Aronov, who speaks 10 languages, reads dictionaries for pleasure and once traveled as an interpreter for Richard M. Nixon. Mr. Aronov, a translator who was born in Uzbekistan when it was part of the Soviet Union, had promised me a recipe for plov, a medium-grain rice dish cooked with beef, onions, carrots and cumin seeds. I was thinking about it for Rosh Hashana, which begins this year at sundown on Sept. 24. Plov is beloved as the national dish of Uzbekistan; Mr. Aronov said that on a diplomatic visit in 1966, Nixon told him, “I won’t leave Russia until you give me that recipe.” Our discussion began in Mr. Aronov’s backyard, equipped with a clay tandoor oven and a long rectangular grill used for shish kebabs. A table was set up under a grape arbor, and nearby was a large iron pot for the fabled plov, which is typically eaten outside in the summer, much in the same way we may eat barbecue. Mr. Aronov, 76, asked whether I would like to attend a dinner after shloshim, the 30-day mourning period following a death, and then we were off to King David Kosher Restaurant on Queens Boulevard, where we were greeted by a woman in a mostly black Chanel suit, the widow of an 86-year-old community elder. About 350 people dressed in black awaited the meal, women with women and men with men. The dinner was interspersed with prayers, the soulful music of the Bukharan Jews and reminiscences of the dead. It began with a half-moon crackerlike flat Uzbeki bread topped with a circular fried sweet pastry dusted in confectioners’ sugar. The sweet was the first thing eaten after the long service to end the mourning. Huge platters of sour cucumber pickles appeared on the tables, as well as cabbage, carrot, eggplant and beet salads. These were followed by platters of fried tilapia with a garlic sauce, meat with cabbage and tomatoes, and finally the much-anticipated plov, which recalled all the comforts of my mother’s slowly cooked beef and carrots, but carried the exotic hint of cumin seed and Asia. Arthur Shakarov, the chef and owner of the restaurant, told me plov is served for all special occasions. He makes it outside in huge iron pots for crowds as small as 20 or as large as 300. At Rosh Hashana, he said, he will sprinkle pomegranate seeds on top, the new fruit and symbol of plenty for the New Year.
