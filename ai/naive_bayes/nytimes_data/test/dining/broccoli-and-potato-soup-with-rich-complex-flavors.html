Broccoli and Potato Soup With Rich, Complex Flavors
Searing the broccoli florets on one side adds dimension to this soup. (Article plus video.)

Sometimes it’s an ingredient that makes a dish shine: an unexpected jolt from lime pickle, say, or the toasty sweetness of a well-placed drizzle of maple syrup. But sometimes it’s all about technique. And such is the case with this broccoli and potato soup. The ingredients list makes it sound like a pleasant-but-quiet thing, a soup you’d slurp without thinking much about it. One spoonful proves otherwise. With a brawny, dark brown undertone, this soup is complex and rich, yet still fresh and green-tasting. You may think the broccoli was simmered in broth made from roasted bones, but the dish is made with only water, vegetables and a little butter. The secret, which I learned from Andrew Feinberg at Franny’s restaurant in Brooklyn (and with whom I wrote a cookbook), is searing the broccoli in oil — but on only one side. It’s a genius idea. The seared side is cooked until the florets turn potato-chip crisp and mahogany brown. The other side is left untouched, green and fresh tasting, the essence of broccoli. The combination of flavors gives the soup its depth. Browning meat is a time-honored technique for adding a caramelized flavor to stews, but it’s not often done with vegetables for soups. It should be. At Franny’s, Mr. Feinberg uses the same method for his zucchini soup. And I intend to try it for a soup made of turnips, which my C.S.A. ensures I have many of, and which are always better browned. To Mr. Feinberg’s original broccoli soup recipe, I added some potatoes for body and creaminess. It makes for a thicker, more filling soup than his version, and works well as a main course rather than as a starter. But feel free to use more broccoli instead of potatoes if you’d rather keep it on the lighter side. I also added some lemon zest and chile flakes for brightness. You can purée the soup to be as smooth or as chunky as you like. I go for middle ground, with just enough texture to keep my teeth engaged. But if you’d prefer something silkier, just keep the motor going on your blender. Then serve it up — a complex, hearty, warming bowl of soup made from the simplest of ingredients. Which is sometimes all you need.
