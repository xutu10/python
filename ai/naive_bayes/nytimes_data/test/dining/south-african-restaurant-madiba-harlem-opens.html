South African Restaurant Madiba Harlem Opens
The Fort Greene, Brooklyn, restaurant opens an outpost uptown and more restaurant news around the city.
===
Headliner MADIBA HARLEM Mark Henegan, who opened Madiba in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, in 1999, has created a larger version of the South African restaurant in Harlem. Like the original, this one is based on a shebeen, a kind of laid-back beer hall in the townships. The generous white space with colorful accents has a selection of South African wines and a fine survey of South African dishes. The menu includes Durban samosas, ostrich carpaccio, Mozambique prawns, South Atlantic lobster tails, several curries, South African-style sausages and bobotie, a Cape Town Malay dish of curried ground meat with rice and a custard topping. The restaurant has been installed in part of MIST (My Image Studios), a catering and event space. Mr. Henegan also runs the adjacent Kalahari Cafe.
