A Trip to the Saltry Restaurant in Alaska
A homegrown Alaskan has turned an old fishermen’s cove into a haven for artful, modern cooking.

HALIBUT COVE, ALASKA — Marian Beck needed a third hand.  She was using her left to steer a skiff through a brisk August morning, returning from a run to a neighbor’s garden to cut lettuce and leeks. With her right, she was reaching across the water to grab a sack of frilled Glacier Point oysters from Weatherly Bates, who grows oysters and mussels just offshore from Ms. Beck’s restaurant here,  Displaying the calm ingenuity that has sustained her and the restaurant for 30 years, Ms. Beck placed a rubber-booted foot on the rudder and got to work with her thumbs, texting furiously, glancing up occasionally to avoid the buoys and lazy sea otters that dot the cold waters of Halibut Cove, off the southern Alaska coast.  Ms. Beck, 60, was reared here on Ismailof Island, about a dozen miles by water from the nearest town, Homer, where Alaska Highway 1 sputters out into gravel 220 miles west of Anchorage. Homer is the main hub of the fishing fleet of Kachemak Bay, which is fed by the Kenai, Susitna and Knik Rivers and is rich with salmon,  The weather, the water and the wilderness that surround Halibut Cove make it an exceedingly difficult place to run a restaurant. The Saltry is a culinary Brigadoon, set among shimmering glaciers and dark evergreens, that evaporates in the fall and reappears every summer, little changed. Ms. Beck (with help from her husband of 37 years, Dave, a commercial fisherman, carpenter and hunter, among other roles) opens only during the brief, intense period of light-filled days that counts as growing season here, starting about when rhubarb appears in April and ending in September, when the restaurant’s gardens have bolted from the heat but the temperature at daybreak can dip below 40 degrees. Halibut Cove was settled by Europeans during a lucrative herring rush that lasted from 1911 through the 1920s; they built canneries and saltries, where the fish were salted and air-dried for export. But by the time Ms. Beck was growing up here in the 1950s, her family were the only full-time residents (except, she said, for six Scandinavian bachelors, left behind by the herring rush). The island had no power or phone service when she was born, in 1953, and still has no roads or cars; everything, from customers to Callebaut chocolate, arrives by boat. By necessity, she learned the traditional food skills that many modern chefs yearn after: she fished for salmon, halibut and cod with her father, a commercial fisherman; baked bread and pies every day with her mother; collected clams, seaweed and coal for cooking from the beaches and bluffs; and learned to preserve fish, berries, moose and deer for the winter. “I drew the line at aged seal meat,” said Clem Tillion, 89, Ms. Beck’s father, who bought the island in 1948 and still lives there. “Other than that, we learned to eat pretty much everything we could find.” Ms. Beck left Halibut Cove in 1972 to study agriculture at California Polytechnic State University, then painting in New York City, and to also travel in Europe, Africa and Central America. Everywhere, she said, she discovered food and flavors that were entirely new to her. When she returned, it was with a determination to move the food of Alaska’s wilderness beyond canned corned-beef hash and salmon cakes. “Everyone said I had to have a burger, or I’d never make it,” she said, setting her jaw in memory. “But I wanted food that was artful and light.” By dint of hard work, she got it. On a hill above the restaurant, a quarter-acre of garden produces salad greens, soft herbs and other fragile ingredients for the menu. She started a ferry business, refurbishing a 1941 wooden-ship-to-shore launch to bring tourists visiting Homer back and forth to the restaurant. She expanded the restaurant, a tiny wooden house with a winged roof, by hanging a huge timbered awning off a cliff to cover outdoor tables and a fire pit that lends warmth and wood smoke to each meal. When it gets warm enough, she hauls huge pots of trailing nasturtiums from her home on the mainland to brighten the landscape and provide edible garnishes for dishes and cocktails. The food is indeed artful and light, even modern; the kitchen is probably the westernmost spot on the continent to turn out things like mustard “caviar,” house-made focaccia and, of course, kale salad.  “I didn’t even know it was a thing,” Ms. Beck said. “We just ran out of lettuce early a few years ago and had to switch.”  Many of the dishes she developed for the original menu in 1984 are still here; firm, nose-tingling pickled salmon that her family has long made from a local strain called China Poot, whose flesh glows a deep orange-red; vegetable nori rolls with perfectly cooked rice that reflect her father’s frequent trips to Japan when he was the chairman of the  Most of her ingredients come from the high-tunnel farms on the mainland that deliver to the farmers’ market in Homer twice a week: In late summer, instead of corn and tomatoes, that means big-leaf greens, multicolored root vegetables, giant cabbages and broccoli and raspberries; from the wild, mushrooms, huckleberries and black currants. (Also at the market: Thai dumplings, Japanese noodles and halibut poke, reflecting the growing Asian and Hawaiian communities in southeast Alaska.) Though not as glamorous as wild salmon, halibut, with its mild taste and firm, high-protein meat, is a high-end mainstay of the Alaska fish trade. Commercial boats pull in the bigger specimens, leaving the smaller, sweeter fish for sport fishermen and local restaurants, where halibut is the default fish for grilling and poaching, for fish and chips, chowder and ceviche.  At the Saltry, the lean fillets are expertly seared and served with something rich and aromatic: strong herbed broth, pungent salsa verde, smooth risotto infused with cream and root vegetables. Halibut cheeks, fat and succulent as sea scallops, command the highest prices at wholesale markets. Hannah Lindoff, who lives in Juneau and is the author of “Mary’s Wild Winter Feast,” a new children’s book about foods native to Alaska, said that a whole halibut is too large to feed just one family, and that its lean meat doesn’t smoke or pickle well like salmon or herring, so it is usually grilled fresh. Both in modern southeast Alaska, and in traditional communities like the Tlingit clan into which she married, “a halibut catch is an excuse for a party,” she said. At gatherings like funerals and potlatches, thin slices of air-dried halibut appear as a special treat, slathered with butter or dipped in seal oil.  Ms. Beck no longer cooks at the Saltry: she hires from a group of chefs, mostly dedicated snowboarders and skiers, who work winters at high-end ski resorts in the Rocky Mountains like Talisker Club and Deer Valley, then disperse for the summer season. “They have to be people who appreciate the creative opportunities and challenges of cooking here,” Ms. Beck said. Adam Walker, the current chef, said he spent this summer reading thick cookbooks from the French Laundry and Eleven Madison Park, something he’d never be able to do while feeding thousands of guests a day from a resort kitchen. The waiters live in tiny cabins next to the restaurant and double as kitchen assistants, fire stokers and keg haulers; extended members of the Tillion clan return each summer to run the ferry, make espresso and shuck oysters. The oysters “get real rich and stay small in the cold water here,” said the youngest Clem Tillion, 18, the fourth in the family to carry that name. About 20 people live on the island all year round; the summer population swells to 120. Relatively speaking, Halibut Cove is temperate, and Ismailof Island has its own wind-sheltered microclimate. The elder Clem Tillion even grows cherry tomatoes on a sunny porch off the room where he keeps his coffin, an electric-blue metallic model he bought in summer 2012, after dreaming that he would die when the leaves turned yellow. It didn’t happen. “We filled it with ice and beer and all the leftover liquor on the island,” he said, “and invited 400 people to a party instead.”
