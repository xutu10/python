A Sausage Roll Recipe for Boxing Day
In Britain, sausage rolls make an appearance on Christmas Eve, on Christmas Day or on Dec. 26, Boxing Day.

Though the concept of savory chopped meat wrapped in dough exists in every cuisine, in one way or another — fried, baked or boiled — the British have proudly claimed sausage rolls as their own. Or so says my friend Caroline, an expat Briton who considers herself an expert in such things. (I am always asking her for the English point of view, and she is not shy.) What is she cooking for the holidays? I asked. Sausage rolls, she said, tons of them. For Caroline, it’s no bother at all to throw together a bit of puff pastry and a batch of sausage meat; she doesn’t even have to measure ingredients, so accustomed is she to the routine. And it is fairly simple. Form the sausage filling into a long log shape and wrap it with dough, slice into pieces, brush with egg wash and bake till golden. If you don’t feel up to the task of making puff pastry, any flaky pie dough will do. Or use frozen puff pastry from the supermarket. It’s not unheard of, and the sky won’t fall. Your kitchen will fill with the heavenly scent of commingled butter, pork, sage and spices. When a platter of these savory bundles hits the buffet table, they are instantly devoured. Indeed, it’s possible to inhale two or three of them in the midst of an olfactory rush without noticing. Actually, given the chance, I like to let them cool, for I find sausage rolls taste best at room temperature. That way they seem more like little meat pies, very British (but also a bit like French pâté en croute). In Britain, sausage rolls make an appearance on  While most of the nibbling may be confined to cold turkey and fruitcake, Caroline insists that sausage rolls, freshly baked or briefly reheated to crisp the pastry, are necessary to make it a real party. I heartily encourage Yankee cooks to emulate this English tradition. Well worth the effort, they are by far the best pigs-in-blankets going, any time of year.
