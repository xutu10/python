Though some of us grill outdoors all year long, summer is the usual time for playing with fire. It’s easy: Throw on a few steaks for a small family dinner, and the barbecue is your best friend when you need to feed a group. Everyone appreciates a flame-licked meal, even if it’s humble burgers and franks. Still, you can make it a bit more challenging, if you’re up for it. A fancy grilling apparatus, by the way, isn’t required. I have cooked on any number of makeshift grills. A temporary U-shaped grill can be assembled in minutes, simply by stacking bricks or concrete blocks, and rigging up some sort of grate. But an outdoor meal doesn’t necessarily mean grilling. How about a spit? For special occasions in Morocco, a whole lamb is turned slowly on a spit over hot glowing coals, until the meat is quite tender and the exterior is browned and crisp. This style is known as mechoui, which means roasted. Every so often the meat is swabbed with an aromatic mixture. Four to five hours later, the meal is ready. You can do that, too. Or not. In her groundbreaking cookbook from 1973, “Couscous and Other Good Food From Morocco,” Paula Wolfert, the great American authority on Moroccan food, gives a slow-roasting method for achieving similar delicious results with a large shoulder of lamb, inside, in a home oven. Believe me, it is glorious. Ask your butcher for a front quarter of lamb (also called a half bone-on chuck). It comprises the neck, shoulder, front shank and some ribs, all in one piece; basically, the front part of the lamb, cleaved in two. It weighs 10 to 12 pounds. You may have to order this a few days in advance. Alternatively, ask for two large bone-in shoulder roasts, which are more readily available. Even this indoor method takes time — at least three hours, maybe more. Here are the rules: The meat must be at room temperature. You must trim the excess fat (or have your butcher do it), salt it and prick it with a knife here and there. And you must carefully baste it with butter and spices throughout the cooking process. The lamb emerges succulent and fragrant, completely cooked and falling-off-the-bone tender. Traditionally it is eaten piping hot, torn straight from the bones with your fingers. You may wish to carve off large chunks and give them a rough chop. I serve this mechoui with warm chickpeas, a bowl of cumin-flavored salt and a dab of spicy harissa. In France, however, where spit-roasted mechoui has long been adopted for large gatherings, the accompaniments are more, well, French. I went to a potluck party once outside Paris. The buffet table was laden with an assortment of vegetable salads, dishes of ratatouille, a pile of baguettes and a platter of cheeses. So, serve whatever you want with your oven-roasted lamb. Be aware, though, that the lamb will disappear in a flash. And how to satisfy the primal urge to cook with fire and smoke? Perhaps you might cook a few appetizers on the patio grill while everyone is standing around, glass in hand, waiting for the meat to be ready. Recipes:
