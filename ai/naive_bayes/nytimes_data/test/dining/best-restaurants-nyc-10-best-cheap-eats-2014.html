The 10 Best Cheap Eats of 2014
The favorites among the corners, counters and places to eat (or slurp or gulp) standing up that Ligaya Mishan reviewed in the past year.

A bowl of pig ears. A faultless burger. Lopsided bread, streaked with salt and chile, speared vertically on two skewers like a barbecued lollipop. Thai curries of soul-shucking heat. A slab of ice cream wrapped in wax paper, dense enough to bite into and so cold it made me gasp, then laugh, then want to tell everyone I know: You must taste this. Some of my happiest moments eating this year happened at these — well, they’re not all proper restaurants, so what shall we call them? Corners, counters, places where you eat (or just slurp and gulp) standing up; where sometimes there’s only one person at the stove, for whom cooking is less art than urgency. Here, in order, are my favorites among the spots I reviewed in 2014: 1. Lumpia Shack Snackbar In the last few years, a number of young Filipino-American chefs and restaurateurs in New York have begun making a case for the cuisine of their heritage, still largely unknown outside immigrant enclaves. Lumpia Shack Snackbar is logistically no more than the name suggests, a compact space with a counter and a few stools, where Neil Syham, born in Manila, plays loose with family recipes. This doesn’t mean that flavors are in any way subdued; rather, they’re articulated, as when sisig — a sublimely fatty hash of pig ears, jowls and belly, blanched and blackened — is set off by pickled vegetables and bright herbs, or when crispy pata, traditionally a monumental pig’s foot, is rendered, ingeniously, as fries.  2.  In the tradition of the Thai raan khao kaeng, or rice-curry shop, dishes here are pre-made, kept heated and replenished throughout the day. Nothing is labeled, so you must place your trust in the chef, Sopon Kosalanan, who cooks alongside his mother and aunt. His brother and sister-in-law oversee the steam table and speak little English beyond the crucial warning “Very hot.” Afterward, to soothe any burns, a pastry case boasts “the best Thai dessert ever in NYC,” including salty sticky black rice pudding, mung-bean-paste candies that could pass for marzipan, and coconut milk haunted by the scent of an incense candle.  3.  Two years ago, when  4. Carnitas El Atoradero Denisse Lina Chavez started cooking at a bodega, simmering carnitas in a caldron that she wrestled onto a portable burner in the middle of the floor. Now she has expanded to the space next door, where, with only slightly more of a kitchen, she produces nightly specials (with a longer roster on weekends) that show the range of what she calls Mexico’s “real food”: mole poblano bitter with cacao beans; goat roasted to collapse over licorice-scented avocado criollo leaves; and pipian verde laced with epazote and yerba santa, Mexican herbs with no true American correlative. She says the depth of her flavors comes from indigenous ingredients, gathered and shipped from Puebla by her sister; I’d attribute it to her nearly evangelical conviction that this is how Mexican cooking should be.  5. Taste of Northern China The Manhattan Bridge heaves above this shallow storefront, which is around the corner from 88 East Broadway on Forsyth Street but takes the two lucky 8s as its address. The owner, Hui Jun Wang, is from Henan Province, and the menu is nomadic, reaching to neighboring Hubei and Shaanxi and to Sichuan in the southwest for some of China’s greatest-hits noodles. Anything impaled on a skewer — whole peppers, belligerently hot; tender chicken hearts; jaw-wrangling tendon — is snowed under with almost too much (but just enough) salt, cumin and chile. One of the best things I ate all year was Uighur-style bread, round, dense and chewy, like an imploded bagel, propped on two sticks. English is at a minimum, as is seating.  6. Chayhana Salom On one of my visits to this unassuming Uzbek restaurant, a cook emerged from the kitchen and, after asking how we liked the food, confided, “Sometimes I can’t sleep at night, because I’m thinking about what I’m going to cook next.” Don’t mind the shabby exterior: The dining room is painted a cheerful celery-green and hung with pictures framed in twigs; tables are set with gilt-edged china and porcelain donkeys carting miniature barrels of salt and pepper. The food plays down the heaviness that Uzbek cuisine is famed for, favoring freshness in dishes like Tashkent plov (layers of lamb, vegetables and rice, golden and airy) and hot-sour lagman noodles alive with cumin and vinegar.  7.  For more than two decades, late at night and only in spring and summer, Maria Piedad Cano, formerly a lawyer and judge in her native Colombia, has sold arepas from a street cart on Roosevelt Avenue in Queens. In June, her sons Douglas Arevalo and Alejandro Osorio opened a restaurant in her honor (good boys), so now the arepas are available almost daily, at normal waking hours. They are still her arepas — Ms. Cano prepares them for the restaurant, and Mr. Osorio and his wife, Nelly Klinger, do the grilling — and priced the same as at the cart. If they lose something by way of atmosphere (no gum-pocked sidewalk or smoky halo, no rasp of the No. 7 train above), the magic still holds.  8.  The entrance is at the back, through a door in a fence that leads to what was once the loading dock of a brewery, repurposed as a terrace, with blue umbrellas hovering over concrete. Inside, ceilings and windows shoot up, suggesting an industrial cathedral, with the flames of a wood-burning pizza oven for an altar. Under the imprimatur of Massimiliano Bartoli, the pizza leans Neapolitan, without the gooeyness. The address has all the trappings of cool, but the intent is to make good food, not create a scene. If anything, the ambience is almost suburban, with long family tables and serve-yourself chile-flake shakers, and all the friendlier for it.  9. El Rey Coffee Bar and Luncheonette El Rey’s chef, Gerardo Gonzalez, is stuck at the back of a coffee shop in a tiny improvised kitchen with almost no visible cooking appliances. No matter. He has an interesting mind: His version of falafel subtracts the main ingredient, merely insinuating it with a pita of za’atar-infused dough and an overlay of sumac and Aleppo pepper, folded around chickpeas. Elsewhere he marries a frittata to pain perdu and makes absurdly rich grits that are unaccountably vegan. His plates verge on botanical, little anarchies of leaves and stems, with wild splashes of orange and pink that nicely interrupt the coffee shop’s minimalist white walls. Find a stool by the front window when the sun is pouring through, and you could be on another coast entirely.  10.  No food made me quite so giddy this year as kulfi from Kwality Ice Cream in Jersey City, a minuscule shop among Newark Avenue’s henna parlors, half-camouflaged temples and cash-and-carries dealing in ghee and Ayurvedic toothpaste. Kulfi is a Mughal-era Indian dessert akin to ice cream, made with milk cooked down until caramelized and verging on chewy; here it comes sliced in nearly inch-thick cakes that I ate out of a foam box outside the PATH station at Journal Square, beside myself at my good fortune. Kwality also offers American-style ice cream in distinctly Indian flavors like faloodeh, rosewater crunchy with basil seeds, and pan masala, which stings with menthol, cloves and lime, until they are the only flavors you remember.
