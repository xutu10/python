Torrisi Italian Specialties The restaurant, a homage to Italian-American cooking that avoided the use of imported products, will be replaced in the spring by an intimate 15-seater for fine dining, and be given a new name. “Once we opened Parm, our idea for this place evolved,” said Jeff Zalaznick, a partner in Major Food Group with Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone. Parm is the casual red-sauce place a few doors south of Torrisi on Mulberry Street. Torrisi Italian Specialties was a quick success — a sandwich shop by day, and by night a more ambitious prix-fixe restaurant. In  Mr. Zalaznick said: “We met our goal in the beginning, but then a dream for the space took hold. It will offer more comfort for our customers. There may be a tasting menu, but we plan to serve à la carte.” Mr. Torrisi will be the chef at the new restaurant. In the meantime, the Major Food Group team is focused on a Parm scheduled to open in mid-December on the Upper West Side, and on a new restaurant at the High Line, opening in January.
