Highbrow House Cocktails That Aim Too High
New restaurants in New York City are offering cocktail lists that are becoming more creative, and not in a good way.
===
All mixed drinks can be divided into two categories: good and not good. A cocktail that you finish involuntarily, that moves to your lips again and again without requiring you to decide to raise your arm, is a good one. A cocktail that you finish because you hate to waste alcohol, or one that you don’t finish at all, is not good. This is the binary theory of cocktail criticism. Lately, an awful lot of the cocktails I’ve had in restaurants have landed with a splat in the “not good” category. Some are rudely sour, or pointlessly bitter, or ickily sweet, or phonily complicated, or just too reminiscent of a spoonful of Robitussin with a hangnail of lemon peel floating on top. Others aren’t actively bad in any of those ways, but they don’t glide down the back of your throat, either; they’re simply not good. New York City’s restaurants are in the midst of an epidemic of not-goodness. Sit down in any new dining room, and you are handed a cocktail list. Each drink on this document will have one ingredient you have heard of and seven that were apparently named after distant planets. Sometimes you may think you recognize a cocktail that you like (a good cocktail, in other words), but everything you like about it has been replaced by some other thing that you’re not sure about. “Hello there, that sounds like an  At this point, newspaper tradition, taking the kindly human form of my editor, demands that I cite specific examples of the not-good restaurant drinks that are supposedly so common. I could name a few, but just hearing what’s in them wouldn’t tell you what’s wrong with them. The drinks I’m talking about aren’t like the lowbrow cocktails of the ’80s with names that could just as easily have been the titles of teen-sex comedies. With those, one look at the ingredients (butterscotch schnapps, Amaretto, Reddi-wip) and you could instantly picture the long night and regret-filled morning down on sorority row. Modern, highbrow restaurant cocktails are different. The ingredients appear to have the right pedigree. Look behind almost any bar, and you’ll find fresh citrus, a half-dozen vermouths and twice as many bitters in brown apothecary bottles. With these drinks, the difference between good and nongood can come down to a missing drop of Peychaud’s or an extra 10 seconds in the shaker. One reason I am suckered by restaurant drink lists so often is that I’ve learned to trust the bartenders at my favorite cocktail lounges, like  As a general rule, though, a restaurant is way more likely to hand you a not-good drink than a bar that prides itself on cocktail conjuring. This wouldn’t be a problem if restaurants didn’t give a false impression of expertise by handing out lists of original drinks. A few years ago, only a few restaurants had cocktail menus, mostly variations on classics like the margarita and the daiquiri. Now, if a server doesn’t offer a list right away, customers ask for one. And restaurants have come to depend on these lists for extra revenue, which comes in two forms: the margin on the cocktails, and the extra cash that first drink of the evening may pry loose from a customer’s money clip. “It’s an unspoken truth in the business,” said Eben Freeman, who used to superintend the bars operated by Mr. White’s Altamarea Group and recently moved to a similar job with  To my cynical ears, the shocking revelation was not that some restaurants engage in a little consensual drunk-rolling. What’s surprising is that so many of them are bad at it. The maneuver’s success depends, after all, on pouring cocktails that the prospective victim will want to finish. Several forces conspire against restaurants that try to serve knockout drinks. The demand for talented bartenders far exceeds the supply these days. The few who are on the job market are often more tempted by offers from high-minded bars where they can focus on their ice-pebble techniques without have to go back to the kitchen to tell an intemperate cook that the man at the end of the bar thinks the tuna tartare is undercooked. Those bartenders who don’t mind the extra hassles of restaurant work may be asked, for the first time in their lives, to write a cocktail menu. “And they are being influenced by others telling them what to put on there, a sommelier or wine director or a chef,” Mr. Freeman said. “Those things can be very positive, but it can also be very confusing to be told, ‘I want you to make this drink I had at Death & Co.’ ” To make life more complicated for these bartenders, the cocktail menu is supposed to reflect the restaurant’s point of view, which may be obvious (Havana in the ’50s) or more abstract (the Weimar Republic filtered through contemporary Bushwick). Oh, and all the recipes need to be original. Almost every restaurant with a liquor license now insists on a menu of proprietary drinks, not classics. Do the math on this, and you quickly run into thousands of new cocktails being cranked up solely to fill these menus. What are the chances that every single one rolling off the factory line is going to deserve a place on the fireplace mantle next to  Pretty low, I’m afraid. This doesn’t mean that bartenders need to stop dreaming up new recipes, but it does suggest that restaurants may stop asking for so many of them. Those menus could be shorter: five good drinks are incalculably better than 15 not-good ones. The recipes could be shorter, too. Long ingredient lists are a leading cause of not-goodness. Imagine for a minute that you run a bar at a restaurant. With your years of wisdom and experience, you can stir four kinds of whiskey with three brands of amaro, squeeze two bottles of bitters over the top, and adjust the balance until its nine ingredients fuse into one drink that helps the entire evening glide along on a pair of waxed skis. Now imagine that you have to teach this cocktail to the dumbest, laziest bartender on your payroll. For convenience, let’s call him Pete. When he is not sneaking around to see if the pastry chef left a pie on the counter, Pete forgets (or “forgets”) to add ingredients that are crucial to your recipes. He never tastes before serving, but whenever you poke a straw into one of his drinks, it is almost always, for one reason or another, not good. If bartenders weren’t so hard to find, you’d take great pleasure in firing Pete. But you’re stuck with him for now, so you decide at last that your restaurant will have to de-elevate its drinks game. For inspiration, you look to the two world capitals of low-effort, high-impact bartending, Italy and Spain. With enough two- and three-ingredient cocktails like the negroni and highballs like the  In the meantime, we customers have to adopt our own strategies. Don’t order from a list that looks seriously out of season; a bar that’s paying close attention won’t serve rhubarb bellinis in January. And don’t order from the list at all if what you really want is a Sazerac, a French 75 or another standard. Restaurants rarely list them, but ordering an off-the-menu classic is not like asking for a bowl of chili at Le Bernardin. You won’t get any dirty looks, but you will probably get a good drink.
