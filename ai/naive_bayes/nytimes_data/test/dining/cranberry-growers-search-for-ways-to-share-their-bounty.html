Cranberry Growers Search for Ways to Share Their Bounty
As cranberry farmers bring in record harvests and berry prices plummet, the industry is trying to recast the fruit outside its usual Thanksgiving milieu.

WARRENS, Wis. —  As you pack away the leftover  This state, which grows more cranberries than any other, is awash in the fruit. Two years of record harvests have sent prices plummeting, and growers are in a desperate race to get rid of their own leftovers. As millions of pounds more than usual sit in storage nationwide, a fog of worry has settled in over the sandy cranberry marshes here that provide a living for nearly 4,000 people. “It’s one of the deepest pits we’ve been in, I’ll tell you,” said Michael Gnewikow, who married into the fourth generation of growers who tend the 190-acre  The holiday season does not offer much relief. Only a fifth of the country’s cranberry supply is eaten between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So the cranberry industry is trying to recast its tradition-bound product in nontraditional ways, aiming to expand the market well beyond the American holiday season and beyond America itself. At the  “We have to think outside of the bog,” said Scott Soares, the former Massachusetts agriculture secretary who runs the trade group. “People just don’t think about them unless they are really right in front of them, which is usually when they are next to the turkey and mashed potatoes.” Only 3 percent of the cranberries grown here and in Massachusetts, New Jersey and the Pacific Northwest are sold as whole, fresh berries, which are in great demand this time of year. The rest are either dried, pressed into juice, canned as sauce or made into pharmaceutical powders. The sweetened dried cranberry, popularized when the grower cooperative Ocean Spray introduced the Craisin as a baking item in the 1990s, is a darling of the snack aisle. Still, there are too many cranberries. Wisconsin broke a record last fall when it harvested 600 million pounds, more than 60 percent of the national supply. Though the amount dropped a little this year, it was the second-largest harvest since growers began raising cranberries commercially here in the 1830s. For some growers who sell cranberries to processors, a pound that brought in 90 cents in 2008 was worth about 12 cents this year. It is not that more land has been turned into cranberry bogs. Growers in the United States and Canada have discovered new varieties and farming techniques that allow them to pull more fruit from each acre. “Everybody’s gotten better at growing the big crops,” said Ray J. Habelman, whose  To that end, the industry has embarked on an aggressive campaign that stretches from Capitol Hill to public school cafeterias to specialty shops in China. “Long term, it really has to be about creating new markets,” said Senator Tammy Baldwin, co-chairwoman of the Congressional Cranberry Caucus, which was formed in 2012 with Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts at the helm. Ms. Baldwin does her part by giving away bags of dried cranberries in her Senate office, which she says are easier to hand out than beer, bratwurst or cheese. As a leader of the caucus, she also pushes the Department of Agriculture to buy excess cranberries, which are then distributed to  In another stroke of fortune, dried cranberries and cranberry juice joined cranberry sauce last summer on the list of U.S.D.A. commodity food available to cooks at public school cafeterias. The  There is almost nothing cranberry marketers will not try. The group has created recipes for bartenders, hoping to harness the popularity of craft cocktails, and recently secured a trademark for “America’s original super fruit.” But cranberry growers are also engaged in serious trade diplomacy, trying to convince countries like India, South Korea and China that the cranberry is worth adding to their culinary canons. Wisconsin growers hosted Chinese buyers in August, letting them taste tart raw berries and cranberry wine. In October, Chinese journalists spent two days in Massachusetts cranberry fields, where they donned waders and stood thigh-deep in bogs filled with floating cranberries. (Such scenes, popularized in advertisements by Ocean Spray, actually happen only at harvest when growers flood their marshes so berries can be mechanically pulled from their vines and skimmed from the surface.) Next year, the marketing committee will have almost $2 million in federal money to persuade other nations to eat the berries, one of only three fruits native to North America that are commercially cultivated. (The other two: Concord grapes and blueberries.) It is not an easy prospect. Few Asian consumers cook with cranberries. But in China, there is interest in the berry’s health properties. Cranberries help with urinary tract infections and are high in antioxidants that can protect cells. Some research has shown the cranberry can fight harmful bacteria. The Chinese bought about 2.8 million pounds of cranberries in 2013. This year they bought almost twice as much, Mr. Soares said. There have been some defeats. In August, the U.S.D.A. denied a request to let growers destroy part of the crop. The process, called volume control, would have reduced each grower’s annual sales by 15 percent and driven up prices. The department was concerned that cooperation between Canadian and American growers might violate antitrust laws. Still, cranberry growers have weathered troubled times before. There was a cancer scare tied to a weed killer in 1959. Fungus threatened bogs in the 1980s. Prices dropped drastically in the 1990s. But there are pockets of optimism here. One is Nodji Van Wychen, the 66-year-old matriarch of the Wetherby company. Ms. Van Wychen started the local  “We rode the roller coaster before,” she said. “All of this is just an opportunity to get more creative.”
