To Nibble: Chocolate at Home in Red Hook Having settled into a spacious new factory in Red Hook, Raaka Chocolate now turns out 20,000 chocolate bars a month and is starting to make truffles and dipped bonbons for the holidays. Ryan Cheney, the owner, picked the name Raaka, which means raw in Finnish, because he liked the cadence of the word. His cacao beans, imported from small growers in Belize, Bolivia, Madagascar and the Dominican Republic, are fermented but not roasted. The company calls it virgin chocolate. It takes days for Nate Hodge, the chocolatier, to process the cacao to a satiny finish, then turn it into bars sweetened with honey or maple sugar, or seasoned with tea and sea salt. One is made with dark chocolate cured in used bourbon barrels. The new facility accommodates tours and classes for children and adults:  To Serve: Telepan Cakes for Takeout Invest in a handsome stand to serve one of these bountiful triple-layer cakes now available from the kitchen of the pastry chef Larissa Raphael at Telepan Local. In addition to six perennial varieties, there’s a seasonal apple one that tastes deeply of the fruit, its butter cream partly crusted with nubbins of streusel. Other flavors include coconut, rich pecan and a very dark chocolate:  To Crush: A Mini Machine for Garlic This matte stainless steel garlic press has a lever to sweep the pressed garlic emerging from the tiny perforations, and another for cleaning it. When closed, it’s heavy enough to smash the cloves for easy peeling. It also has a generous capacity:  To Consult: A Chef Shows How to Stock Up In his book “My Perfect Pantry,” Geoffrey Zakarian, the chef at the Lambs Club, the National and the Plaza’s Palm Court, features 50 ingredients all good cooks should keep on hand. He also provides three recipes that use each ingredient, and photos. There are practical tips for shopping, storage and use. He does not list mayonnaise as an ingredient but instead gives a recipe for a food-processor version to which he adds a smidgen of gelatin as a binder and stabilizer. His salade niçoise is classically made with canned tuna, and his curried cauliflower soup with coconut milk is a silken treat. I found it curious that he suggests stocking white and brown long grain rice but not short grain like arborio:  To Marinate: Whey, an Ingredient You Probably Don’t Know Homa Dashtaki, whose White Moustache yogurt is dense Persian style, is selling whey, the liquid byproduct of straining the yogurt. Use the whey in smoothies, sauces and drinks, or, if you buy it by the bucket, to brine a turkey. In his new cookbook, “Farm, Fork, Food,” the chef Eric Skokan recommends whey for boiling pasta and poaching chicken. Ms. Dashtaki said a whey brine makes for a juicier, more flavorful turkey. I tried it with a chicken, which was quite moist after roasting. It also browned better and took less time to cook:  To Ignite: New Chile Sauces, Moderate to ‘Painful’ Nacxitl Gaxiola, the former chef at La Superior who is also a researcher and consultant on Mexican food, has developed three muscular sauces in fat little jars with the Xilli label. The name is said to be the Nahuatl word for chile. The mole poblano, marked “moderate” for heat, is thick and at once sweet and pleasantly bitter. It could stand in for hoisin sauce with Peking duck. The Salsa Macha, labeled “hot,” is quite tolerable, very oily, ruddy and crunchy with nuts. The Chipotle Abodabo, graded “painfully hot,” is nearly black, thick and fiery with hunks of chile:
