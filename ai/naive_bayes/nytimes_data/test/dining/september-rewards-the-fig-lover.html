September Rewards the Fig Lover
While the fresh fruit is at its ripest, the timing is right for a flaky phyllo dessert.
===
If you are a fig lover, as I am, and there are fig trees nearby, you enjoy watching every moment of their growth, even if much of that involves waiting for things to happen. In early spring, when the first green sprouts begin to show on bare branches, there’s a little thrill. Wait awhile longer, and suddenly the tree is covered with new leaves that already possess a faint figgy perfume. If you are lucky enough to have your own fig tree, or access to one, take a few of the larger leaves and use them to make baked goat cheese. It’s easy to do: Put the leaves on a baking sheet, then top with thick slices from a log of goat cheese and a drizzle of olive oil. Bake in a hot oven (375 to 400 degrees) until the cheese bubbles a bit. Spread the warm cheese on toast. (The leaves add fragrance, but don’t eat them.) In June, the figs begin to form, and that’s exciting too, even though the first figs are somewhat inferior in flavor to their late-summer cousins. Just like tomatoes and peppers, the sweetest figs need another month or two of constant sunshine. You don’t resist the early ones, but you wait until August for the best. In warm weather, the trees continue to produce beautifully into September. The trouble is, some figs come to market still firm and underripe; you can try to let them ripen at room temperature, but you may not have much success. Others are so ripe they go mushy, and sometimes moldy, within a day. These should be peeled and cooked for jam or preserves. A good ripe fig is tree-ripened, soft enough to squeeze, yet not withered. When you cut it, the interior will be juicy and luscious-looking and, depending on the variety, a glossy reddish purple, pink or gold. That’s the kind of sweet fig you have been waiting for, the kind you eat as is, just plain and wonderful. For a snack or first course, you can pair your perfect late-season figs with thinly sliced prosciutto or a few slices of mild pecorino cheese. For an easy dessert, compose little bowls of quartered figs and add a few raspberries and a splash of sweet muscat wine. For a more impressive one, try these flaky phyllo pastries, which are not at all difficult to make. Form packages of phyllo leaves brushed with butter, add a smear of sweetened ricotta and top them with ripe figs cut into star shapes. Lightly sugared, baked and drizzled with honey, they are a cross-cultural pleasure, almost like a French tartlet, but with Middle Eastern undertones.
