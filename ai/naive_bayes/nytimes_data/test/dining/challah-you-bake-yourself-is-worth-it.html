Challah You Bake Yourself Is Worth It
Golden and fragrant, this challah should be on the table for the first night of Hanukkah.

No matter how good a bakery challah tastes, baking it myself tastes better. Golden and fragrant and topped with toasted seeds, mine will be on the table for the first night of  Homemade is better because it is most likely fresher and not so inflated with air. It may take more effort than picking up at loaf at the store, but it is worth it. In 2001, I wrote a recipe here called  Rather than reinvent for the sake of reinvention, I prefer to combine and interweave elements of various Jewish traditions that I have discovered from around the world. Fennel or anise is a traditional element of Moroccan Jewish challah. And because fennel and orange go so well together, I include a bit of orange zest with some fresh orange juice in the dough for its scent and brightness. The added flavor and natural sweetness from the orange allows for a reduction in the amount of sugar. I usually make the dough a day ahead and put it in the refrigerator to rise slowly so that I can maintain control and adjust the baking to my schedule. When my children were little, I used to make the dough before they came home from school, then asked them to punch it down and braid it. Shaping dough was the perfect task for young cooks, especially as a distraction if they had been bickering. Although I am partial to a six-braided challah, when I am in a hurry, I make a long cylinder, fold it over and then twist three times to form a spiral sort of braid. Then I squish the braid together so it will be squatter and fatter, or I stretch it longer and swirl it into a circle. Dried fennel seeds from my garden are scattered on top, along with sesame and poppy seeds. Hot from the oven, it begins my Hanukkah meal.
