Christmas Cookie Recipe CookFight
Kim Severson argues for holiday-cookie tradition. Julia Moskin bends the rules. (Article plus video.)

CookFight is an occasional series in which Kim Severson and Julia Moskin battle it out in the kitchen. The latest challenge: the holiday cookie plate. Good cooks know their strengths, which is why I thought Julia Moskin would understand she had no business making Christmas cookies. Christmas cookies are the pop-culture expression of the biggest Christian holiday in America. A good cookie plate is built on a delicate mix of tradition, community and deliciousness. There must be the cookie for Santa, the cookie you grew up eating and the extra special ones to give as gifts. Cookie plates can also be competitive, a point no one who has been to a Christmas cookie exchange party would dispute. My dear friend and cooking competitor knows not of the Christmas cookie. She was raised Jewish on the Upper West Side. I was raised a Roman Catholic in the South and Midwest. Sure, she may have eaten a few Christmas cookies at the office, or at least one of those Star of David sugar cookies with blue icing that Christians make this time of year as a kind of peace-talky gesture. That does not a Christmas cookie expert make. Still, she wanted to rumble. Fine, Moskin. I pity the fool. I like a Christmas cookie plate that says this a house filled with holiday cheer, where guests are welcomed and good neighbors are celebrated. So, after consulting some of the best holiday cookie bakers I know, I made my plan. For my three cookies, I went with a balance of simple and special, traditional and modern. The delicate linzer tree screams Christmas, but in a delicious and sophisticated way. The dough, made with ground roasted almonds, is at once buttery and toasty. Each tree has two thin cookies pressed together, the top cookie punched with holes so that jewel-colored jam will ooze up and evoke Christmas ornaments. They came from Allison Dykes, a friend and neighbor who spent an afternoon teaching me the precise technique. They are the cookies you give only to your closest friends and favorite neighbors. I grew up with fudge on my family plate, so I also wanted something chocolate but more complex. My chewy chocolate snowcaps, rich with cocoa and chopped chocolate and studded with roasted pecans, hit that mark. They get a dip in crushed sugar cubes right before baking so they come out of the oven looking like glossy little chocolate mountaintops. The best part? They are gluten-free without screaming gluten-free. This was my ace in the hole. Last, I went deep into my family’s own tradition. I grew up standing at the stove with my mother’s pizzelle iron, turning out the delicate, subtle waffle-like wafers that we would store in coffee cans until it was time to refresh the cookie plate. Anise-scented pizzelles offer a palate break from all that sugar and butter and go nicely with tea. They were the perfect cookie to round out my trifecta of awesomeness. As a child of an Italian mother, making pizzelle was a rite of passage, a handing down of history and a symbol of love and holiday like no other. Who could argue with tradition like that? Not even Moskin. I entered our holiday cookie CookFight with a keen sense of disadvantage. It has been a sheltered existence, but as a lifelong New Yorker I have never produced — and rarely even encountered — a holiday cookie plate. Even during the holiday season, Manhattan is not a place where friends ever “drop by” unexpectedly; the doorman of my building bars entry to carolers; Santa Claus does not visit my alt-Jewish household. Severson is a passionate producer of holiday cookies from the Italian and Scandinavian traditions, with sidelines in Midwestern industriousness and the Southern sweet tooth. She even has a sweeping Theory of Cookie Plate Composition, gleaned from a lifetime of Christmases, that I could not hope to match (or even understand). I addressed this with my usual stoicism and grit, texting Severson constantly to suggest ways to make things easier for me. For example, I felt I should be allowed to enter bacon fat gingersnaps, based on our mutual favorite Times recipe for Swedish ginger cookies. She put the kibosh on that quickly, pointing out that it’s so good as to be prejudicial (but listed here nonetheless). We then hammered out an agreement: no other gingersnap would be allowed into competition. When it became clear that I would not be able to weasel my way to victory, I took a new tack. I’ve made cookies. How hard could this be? In the same way that Michael Jordan decided he could play pro baseball just because he happened to be the greatest living basketball player, I decided I could win at holiday cookies. Fortunately, I already had one slam dunk: a recipe for the greatest peanut butter cookie in existence. She sneered, but I knew that this cookie’s sandy, melting texture and combination of sweet, salt, crunch and richness transcended the boring connotations of “peanut butter cookie.” Next, a Hanukkah cookie. Oil-frying is part of the holiday’s food tradition, but making doughnuts at home seems excessively difficult — especially on the same night you’re cooking endless batches of latkes. Traditional treats like strudel and rugelach are also challenging, so I swapped in my new favorite ingredient, all-butter puff pastry, instead of the traditional cream-cheese dough, usually used for both. It was a hit. Then I tweaked the filling to make it more, well ... Christmassy. The result has the dried fruit and citrus flavors of traditional mince pie, folded in a rich crust. “Puff pastry is cheating,” Severson said, but only after she tasted the results. Next she accused me of “pandering” with my reboot of the Girl Scout Thin Mint, and tried to rattle me with pronouncements like “candy canes are such a cliché.” She was, after all, the confident one. She had an actual family recipe, with Christmas memories attached. Family loyalty looms large in the Severson psyche, and it blinded her to a simple fact: Dry wafers with no taste (except for a hint of ever-unpopular anise) do not a winning recipe make. Perhaps her pizzelles would be my secret weapon.
