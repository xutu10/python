Wine School: St.-Joseph
The best combination of value and distinctiveness is found in St.-Joseph, a region that follows the sinuous north-south twists of the Rhône River.

I tend not to think of wines seasonally. The convention of reds in cold weather, and whites and rosés in warm, doesn’t make much sense to me, as food dictates the choice of a wine more than the temperature. Yet certain exceptions present themselves: namely, the red wines of the northern Rhône Valley of France, which I seem to crave especially in the fall and winter. These wines speak to me of burning leaves and crackling wood fires, of roasts and stews and sizzling meats, of comforting sweaters, wool blankets and dogs curled at your feet. Syrah, the red grape of the northern Rhône, is grown all over the world. It can make fine wines in California and Washington State; in Australia, where it’s most often called shiraz, and in South Africa. Yet the greatest, most distinctive expressions of syrah, I believe, are from the granite soils of the northern Rhône. This part of the Rhône is surprisingly small, and the best wines tend to come from modest family estates. The most famous appellations, Hermitage and  The three St.-Josephs I recommend are: Domaine Faury St.-Joseph 2012, J. L. Chave Selections St.-Joseph Offerus 2011, Alain Graillot St.-Joseph 2012, I won’t mislead you. These wines may be difficult to find; that’s the nature of good northern Rhônes. Luckily, I can offer many good alternatives. First, the best St.-Josephs are produced by Pierre Gonon and Jean-Louis Chave (the estate wine; the Offerus is made from purchased grapes and young vines). They are expensive and hard to find, but worth snapping up if you see them. Other St.-Josephs I highly recommend include La Ferme des Sept Lunes, Dard et Ribo, Bernard Gripa, Domaine Barrou, Étienne Becheras, Domaine Monier, Aurien Chatagnier and Domaine Romaneux-Destezet (Hervé Souhaut). If all these St.-Josephs are also elusive, you can substitute Alain Graillot’s Crozes-Hermitage or Éric Texier’s Côtes du Rhône Brézème. As for foods, almost anything that suggests winter will do: roasts, hearty stews, even good hamburgers (go easy on the ketchup).
