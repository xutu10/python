This Bird’s Gone South
Plantains and spices with lime and orange juice take the winter out of a traditional chicken stew.

A bubbling pot of chicken stew with potatoes is a hearty, comforting thing. But substitute sweet plantains for the tubers, and suddenly your dinner leaps from familiar and predictable to unexpected and a whole lot more interesting — at least for someone who doesn’t eat plantains very regularly. I tried this recently when I was desperate to cook something imbued with sunshine and balmy breezes. A pile of near-black plantains at the supermarket reminded me of a trip to Puerto Rico back when I was pregnant and starving all the time. I craved the starchy softness of plantains and ate them at every meal: fried with eggs for breakfast; in pastelón, a layered lasagnalike dish, for lunch; in mofongo, a mound of mashed plantains with garlic, pork and cracklings, for dinner. Back in Brooklyn, I went through a brief but fervid plantain-frying phase that taught me a few things about this member of the banana family. The first is that while plantains are edible at every stage of ripeness from green to yellow to black, the darker they are, the sweeter, riper and softer. And when it comes to fried plantains, I like sweet, ripe and soft. Sometimes that meant buying the yellow ones and keeping them on the counter for a few days until they darkened. I tried to let them go as long as possible, just shy of rotten. They were worth the wait. Another useful tidbit: While it seems intuitive to peel open a plantain like a banana, pulling down on the stem, there’s an easier way. Trim the top and bottom off, then use the tip of your knife to slit down the length of the peel (try not to cut into the flesh). On a ripe plantain, the skin will peel right off. On a green one, more tugging is required. Or try microwaving a green plantain for a minute before peeling. This helps loosen the skin. Before settling on my recent experiment of chicken and plantain stew, I briefly contemplated attempting mofongo. But it’s a complicated endeavor that uses green plantains; the chicken stew is far easier and uses sweet plantains. Ideally, for this recipe, you want plantains that are mottled black and yellow; they should be ripe but not mushy so they slice nicely. In keeping with the warm-climate theme, I added lime juice to my stew, along with fragrant cumin, chile and oregano. Instead of the usual wine, I used tomato and orange juice as the liquid. And brined green olives lent just the right salty note. All in all, my chicken and plantain stew was as far from my usual stewed chicken with potatoes as Puerto Rico is from Brooklyn. And in the middle of January, I know where I’d rather be.
