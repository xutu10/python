Raise the Punch Bowl Thermostat
A hot rum concoction warms up winter parties. (Article plus video.)

Your typical party punch is all well and good when the weather is fine. But in winter, when there’s a damp chill no layering of sweaters can defeat, a hot rum punch is what you want at a holiday celebration. Other than warming your bones, a hot rum punch has advantages over its icy cousin. Without the ice, it does not become diluted as the evening wears on, meaning the last cup is as potent as the first (though maybe not quite as hot). Even better, if you want to, you can set a hot punch on fire, which beats a fruited ice ring for theatrics any day. A note for those interesting in trying the pyrotechnics: Do not be tempted to try this in anything other than a fireproof bowl. I was once lulled into a false sense of security by the promise of tempered heatproof glass. What I didn’t factor in was the temperature differential between the top of the bowl where the flames were, and the cooler bottom of the bowl filled with liquid. The result? Shattered glass, spilled booze, mournful guests. Metal is your safest bet here, though I’ve used heavy-duty ceramics without incident. A soup pot is a practical though less elegant option. If you’re not planning to set this punch ablaze, use any heatproof bowl you like, glass included, though avoid anything very fragile because you’ll be mixing in boiling water. No flames also means you don’t need to search out the 100-proof rum, whose primary purpose is flammability (though it also does add to the potency). A regular proof, good quality white rum can be used instead. Then I add amber rum, cognac to smooth out any rough edges, and lemon and a little tangerine zest and juice for verve. I adapted this punch recipe from my friend David Wondrich, the cocktail historian, who borrowed it from Charles Dickens, who used it to mitigate the damp winters of Victorian England. (The tangerine was my main tweak.) But even for those of us with modern central heating, nothing warms a body like that first steaming sip.
