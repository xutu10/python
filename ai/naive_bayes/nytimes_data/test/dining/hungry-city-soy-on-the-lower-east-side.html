Soy on the Lower East Side
Etsuko Kizawa dishes out an overtly maternal version of Japanese comfort food in what feels like an offshoot of her apartment.
===
The first time I stepped into  I had quietly — perhaps too quietly — eased into a seat at the front of a curiously cluttered room that looked as though it could operate as either a bar or a thrift shop, depending on the time of day. Customers slurped soup. Beyond that, nothing appeared to be happening. I detected movement back in the kitchen, but for a while no one approached. I was hungry, with the sort of gnawing afternoon appetite that takes only a few minutes to mutate into muttering irascibility. Just as I was about to grab my coat and dash away, a wide-eyed 5-year-old boy materialized by my table. “Do you want to take his order?” I heard his mother ask him. If you have ever seen “ I wound up returning to Soy several times, and I was increasingly gratified to be there — well, at least once I had surrendered to its languorous pace. These days, the Lower East Side overflows with new restaurants that practically vibrate with brisk service and creative energy:  Plenty of New York restaurants aim to manufacture a sense of homeyness, but Soy feels like an actual offshoot of someone’s apartment. Ms. Kizawa’s son, Taiyo, contributed the drawings that grace the walls. (“Stop being sad,” one says.) Depending on the chef’s mood, Liz Phair or Sheryl Crow may serenade diners from a couple of speakers above the bar. Scattered family items (a toy Godzilla, a chessboard, a bicycle helmet) could be regarded as décor elements, or maybe it’s just that Ms. Kizawa, like most New Yorkers, doesn’t have much free space for storage. If you cling to the image of Japanese restaurants as spare sanctuaries that could have sprung from the mind of Calvin Klein, Soy will disabuse you of that stereotype. Ms. Kizawa’s cooking is as gentle as the atmosphere she fosters. She’s not trying to stage some sriracha-versus-Sichuan-peppercorns death match. Her beef curry delivers simple solace, especially on a cold day, even if a connoisseur of Japanese curries may quibble that the flavor of the russet-tinged, rice-coating gravy verges on too subtle. “Everyone’s crazy about spicy tuna bowl!” Soy’s menu declares, and it is a good bowl indeed, even though the sauce on the tuna (atop a pillow of sushi rice) bespeaks a very mild manifestation of lunacy. That spiciness is more of a whisper than a scream. Soy looks, feels and smells like a vegetarian restaurant, and Ms. Kizawa’s daily specials often incorporate ingredients like beet greens, pumpkin, daikon and chrysanthemum leaves. Her vegetable dumplings display the correct balance of crispiness and chewiness; the same goes for her edamame and cheese rolls, which enwrap knobs of melted fontina. But meat is on the menu, too, and if you wander in on the right day, Ms. Kizawa may be frying up her “everything burger,” whose tiny patties involve a blend of beef, pork, chicken and tofu. Nevertheless, Soy’s signature dish, spiritually speaking, must be its “tofu steak,” in which Ms. Kizawa glazes pan-crisped slices of tofu with a muted mushroom sauce. It doesn’t make a lot of noise, but that’s O.K. New York has plenty of noise already.
