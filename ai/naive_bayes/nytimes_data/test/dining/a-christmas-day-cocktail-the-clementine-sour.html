A Christmas Day Cocktail, the Clementine Sour
Toasting holidays past and present with a cocktail of amaretto, Curaçao, bourbon and clementines.

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire are all fine and well, but to me, the most satisfying smells of  For the home bartender, Christmas Day poses an unusual challenge: all of those assorted thirsts to quench, all of those other strong flavors to compete with and all of those ghosts to confront. Memories of Christmases past, happy and sad, bubble up; with all of the guests and chaos, the present feels more uncomfortably present than usual; and, with New Year’s approaching, one’s thoughts also turn toward the future. All of these ghosts come at us at once, but when making cocktails, it’s best to focus on the friendly ones. My earliest drinking memory concerns the amaretto left behind on my family’s coffee table after a Christmas Eve party one year. That means that I had my very first taste of liquor (it smelled like candy, and I couldn’t resist) on Christmas Day. I still love amaretto, and wanted to include it in a new cocktail I will serve to friends and family on the holiday. Its heavy, viscous sweetness requires a light hand and attention to balance. A soft wash of the stuff inside a glass does the trick. But the strongest element of Christmas past I wanted to include is the memory of my mother, who — never mind that she was Jewish — loved the holiday. (Maybe that’s a New York thing.) Her cocktail was always the whiskey sour, which means it was the first cocktail I ever made, always with a slug of amaretto added. The drink offered here is an updated and tweaked variation. Clementines are among winter’s most delicious pleasures, and to my eye there’s no better, easier centerpiece for Christmas Day than a bowlful of them. But I like eating them even more than beholding them. Extracting their juice for cocktails takes a little time, but it’s worth it. Their flavor is lighter and brighter than an orange’s, sweeter than a lemon’s and, really, their own distinctive thing. And I’m pretty sure that, at some point, I connected the clementine not quite consciously with  Brown sugar, cloves and cinnamon are ingredients I often include in my preferred hot Christmas drink,  To make your life easier, prepare the syrup and juice the clementines a day or so in advance. That way, when Christmas Day comes, this cocktail will come together in a snap. And a proper cocktail on the holiday will elevate the event and make your guests feel special.
