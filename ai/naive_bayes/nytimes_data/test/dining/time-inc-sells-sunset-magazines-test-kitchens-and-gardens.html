Time Inc. Sells Sunset Magazine’s Test Kitchens and Gardens

Sunset magazine, which for more than a century has chronicled California living from the kitchen to the patio and beyond, will pack up its test kitchens and garden tools and find a new home. In a letter to employees Wednesday, Time Inc. announced that it had sold Sunset’s serene seven-acre Menlo Park, Calif., campus of carefully designed gardens and 1950s ranch-style buildings to Embarcadero Capital Partners, a San Francisco real estate investment and management company. The buildings were designed by Cliff May, the architect many consider the father of the California ranch home. His work helped articulate in architecture the postwar West Coast suburban boom and spawned a lifestyle that Sunset embraced. “When I moved to Berkeley in 1973, I had all these articles I had been pulling out of Sunset,” said Ruth Reichl, the former editor of Gourmet magazine and New York Times restaurant critic. “I had one that told you how to build your own bread oven in your backyard. They were so ahead of the curve. They made California seem like the most romantic place on earth.” Time Inc. will continue to publish Sunset. The magazine offices will stay on the campus until the end of the year, she said. “We will be working together with the Sunset team on a thoughtful search for a new home for our operations after the New Year,” wrote Evelyn Webster in a letter to employees. Time Inc. this year sold the property near Birmingham, Ala., that housed magazines such as Southern Living and Cooking Light to Samford University. Samford leased back part of the campus to Southern Progress, the Time Inc. company that publishes those magazines and others, including Sunset. Several Time Inc. media outlets have endured a year of sizable layoffs as Time Warner prepared to spin off Time Inc. as a separate publicly traded company. Sunset began as a pamphlet of sorts in 1898 started by Southern Pacific Railroad executives who wanted to lure Easterners to the untamed West. The magazine went on to define the California lifestyle for aspirational newcomers looking to embrace the relaxed, open way people on the West Coast gardened, traveled and ate. In the 1950s, the magazine moved into the new Cliff May campus in Menlo Park, which would go on to become the site for pilgrimages by loyal readers. Many came for the Sunset Celebration Weekend, a large community event that showcased Sunset’s food, wine and gardening interests. The event will be held one last time on the campus this summer. Sunset staff members had long used the campus grounds and the grand dining areas and kitchen to produce a magazine that embraced local food before it was a cliché and that was respected among cooks for recipes that were impeccably tested by a cadre of home cooks who tried to replicate what food writers and chefs had developed. The magazine publishes different editions for regions in the West, and its recipes reflected subtle difference between Northern and Southern California cuisine as well as styles of eating that stretched into Washington and Hawaii. The gardens, too, were a reflection of the magazine’s deep regional devotion, with parts sectioned off into climate zones so editors could determine which plants might work best in different states. Staff members were not commenting out of concern for their jobs, but the mood was dark, some said. For many, it was not a surprise that Time Inc. was looking to sell a prized piece of real estate in one of the most expensive real estate markets in the country, but how the magazine would fare in a new, less historical and beautiful environment was a concern. “It will be hard for Sunset to survive as it represents itself now . . . as a working voice of the West, without the tools for testing and experimenting,” said
