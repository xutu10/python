Headliner KAPPO MASA Larry Gagosian, the art dealer, has long believed that the Madison Avenue neighborhood around his Gagosian Gallery needed more restaurants. “I had an idea for a restaurant in this building,” he said, referring to the one that houses the flagship of his chain of galleries. He asked the chef Masa Takayama, at whose restaurants he had long been a regular, if he’d be interested in going in as a partner. Just like that, the deal was done. Mr. Takayama turned the lower level into an understated, elegant dining room. The walls are made of pale textured oya stone, hung with only a few pieces of art. “This is not going to be an extension of the gallery,” Mr. Gagosian said. The open kitchen produces raw and cooked items for a vast yet seasonal and often luxurious menu of sushi; sashimi; and grilled, steamed, braised and fried dishes often strewn with caviar or white truffles and served on dinnerware that Mr. Takayama designed. Sashimi is arrayed on frozen blocks of glass, and at lunch there will be preset bamboo bento boxes.
