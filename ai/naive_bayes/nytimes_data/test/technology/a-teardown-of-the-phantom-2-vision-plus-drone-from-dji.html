A Teardown of the Phantom 2 Vision Plus Drone from DJI
A drone model from DJI comes with a camera, GPS positioning and other features meant for producing high-quality still images and video.

Look to the sky and say “Cheese!” Taking photos and videos from a flying drone has quickly emerged as a popular hobby, allowing for often stunning images from new perspectives. One of the latest drones designed to capture these images is the Phantom 2 Vision Plus, a $1,300 machine made by DJI. The drone, which has four propellers, comes equipped with a camera attached to the bottom that can record high-resolution images and high-definition video. The Phantom comes with many other features for visual storytelling. A user can control the device using a remote control hooked up to an iPhone or Android smartphone, where live video from the drone’s camera can be streamed. By using images supplied to the smartphone, pilots can navigate the drone even when it is out of a direct line of sight. People flying the Phantom 2 can capture images at different angles by using an app to control the camera. And compared with previous drones from DJI, the Phantom 2 has a removable battery and smarter flight software. Flying it is far easier than flying previous remote control helicopters or aircraft, thanks in part to the drone’s intelligence. If a user lets go of the controls, for instance, the Vision will use a GPS device to position itself. That GPS device will also help stabilize the aircraft from external forces, like strong gusts of wind. And the device can be programmed to move to specific points in the air over time. It is easy to imagine how the Vision Plus could be put into the hands of people who want to document sports or other events, or even those who might want to photograph the exteriors of buildings. The camera does not record audio, but most external sounds would be drowned out by the loud whizzing of the props and their electric motors anyway. And besides, those taking videos at a wedding — one of the many new popular uses for drones — will probably want to set them to “Electric Boogie” anyway.
