Use Caution in Updating Adobe Flash Player or Reader
Plus, how to display new purchases in iTunes.
===
Q. A. Adobe does have its own update utility that regularly checks for new versions of the Flash Player and informs you when new software is ready. If you do not remember installing Adobe Updater — or do not see it in the computer’s list or folder of applications — be very suspicious of any alerts about Flash Player updates. You should also be extremely wary of software update alerts that pop up soon after you connect to a public wireless network, including those in hotels and coffee shops. Alerts or installer windows that suddenly disappear from the screen as soon as you quit a browser program often have malicious intent. Adobe’s site has a page at  Q. A. You can get to the settings for the Recently Added area from the drop-down menu on the right side of the iTunes window. Click the arrow next to Albums, Songs, Movies or whatever the name of the library view you have on display. When the menu opens, you can see the settings for the Recently Added list, with a drop-down menu that lets you adjust the period of time that something is considered new to the library. From the menu, you can choose to show all items added from This Month, the Last Three Months, the Last Six Months or Last Year, which can make for a very busy list if you are a frequent iTunes shopper. If you would rather not see your purchases highlighted at all in the top of the iTunes window, you can remove the Recently Added section by turning off the checkbox next to “Show Recently Added” before closing the menu.
