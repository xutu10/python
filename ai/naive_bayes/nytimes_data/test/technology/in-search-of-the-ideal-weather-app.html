Searching for the Best Weather App Among Weather Underground, Weatherbug and More
The technology for weather apps for iPhones and Android phones is evolving quickly. But not all apps are created equal.

WEATHER can be a great equalizer. It can also be a way to make conversation with just about everyone. No wonder, then, that the weather forecast is one of the pieces of information many of us crave when starting each day — and that weather apps are among the most frequently used programs on smartphones. Weather apps aren’t all created equal, though. The built-in apps on iPhones and Android phones are perfectly serviceable, offering glanceable forecasts for as many cities as you want, and they’re tied into the phones’ virtual assistants. But weather technology — both the creation and presentation of forecasts — is evolving quickly. It’s worth checking out the options. For prettier backdrops,  In the end, though, finding the right weather app is really a matter of personal taste in the design, how much information you want and, crucially, how much you trust the forecast. And there is a bit of a philosophical difference brewing in terms of how those forecasts are created. Now, weather apps are often powered by one of a few sources of information, including the  The forecasts coming from those services combine data from the  Then, a meteorologist usually comes in to interpret and analyze the data and, based on a mix of experience and education, chooses the information on which to base a forecast. The data and forecasts created in that way power many weather apps. The Weather Channel provides Apple’s built-in forecasts, for example, while Weather Underground provides data for Google’s weather and powers  Those data and forecast providers all have their own apps as well. The Weather Channel app, for example, offers useful information like airport conditions and flu outbreak updates by region, while Weather Underground has the richest (and geekiest) information. For my taste, Weatherbug is the best app offered by the main providers, because it offers niceties like the ability to sort your forecast by whether it’s a good day for golf or one that is likely to cause dry skin. But the folks behind Dark Sky, a popular and visually stunning weather app, are doing things a bit differently. That company formed about three years ago to create a new kind of forecast that would use radar data to predict whether it was going to rain — or stop raining — in an immediate location and within the next hour. No one was really doing that, said Adam Grossman, a co-creator of the Dark Sky app. So the company had to build its own computer programs for figuring out radar data for that one example: Is it going to be raining an hour from now in this one, specific spot? That work evolved into longer-term forecasting, and led to a separate product called Forecast. Mr. Grossman says the weather predictions all come from computers; no meteorologists are involved. Algorithms compare predictions from various stations or weather sources with historical accuracy and spit out purely statistical predictions. “We get a lot of flak from meteorologists who say computers can’t do it and you always need a human in there to call the shots,” Mr. Grossman said. “But humans are really bad at forecasting. When it comes to weather forecasting it’s best to leave it to the computers.” It’s a bit like “Moneyball” hits weather prediction — the idea that statistical models can, in the long run, offer better forecasts than a mix of information and gut instinct. But the folks at the Weather Channel say there are plenty of computers involved in their forecasting — and humans who know how to make the most of the data, too. “We’re an organization that employs hundreds of meteorologists, plus the computational science required to produce the forecast and then deploy it,” said Kevin Doerr, who manages consumer digital products at the Weather Channel. “That ends up being kind of our secret sauce. There’s a big difference between whether you’re just taking the data and pushing it out, and improving or augmenting the data.” The forecast model for longer-term predictions is new, and still evolving. But so far, the secret sauce scores higher, at least according to  ForecastWatch runs  In San Francisco So, as always when it comes to the weather, there’s much to discuss and few clear answers. But as forecasting grows more advanced and the data is more accessible to app makers, Mr. Grossman said, developers would experiment with presenting it in more interesting and useful ways. “For some people, wind is very important; for others, rain is very important,” he said. “But another branch is people who are supplementing things, not necessarily weather. Apps with calendar information can tell people they might want to leave a little early because rain is coming.” And weather, always a reliable topic of conversation, is social in apps, too. The Weather Channel’s app lets people report the weather in their immediate area and even upload photos — all of which helps the app improve its hyperlocal accuracy. And the Weather Underground app lets you upload hazards like downed power lines and blackouts. Perhaps my favorite new weather app is  Now that is how you add a human touch to the weather.
