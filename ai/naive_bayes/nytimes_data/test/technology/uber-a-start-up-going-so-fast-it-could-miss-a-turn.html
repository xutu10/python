Uber, a Start-Up Going So Fast It Could Miss a Turn
The company is facing its toughest challenge yet — curbing its ugliest, most aggressive impulses before its win-at-all-cost culture begins to turn off investors, potential employees and the public.

In just four years of operation, Uber has ignited a new global ride-sharing industry with the promise of transforming urban transportation and helping many people get by without owning cars. But these days, the hot start-up is facing its toughest challenge yet — curbing its ugliest, most aggressive impulses before its win-at-all-cost culture begins to turn off investors, potential employees and the ride-hailing public at large. The revelation,  Uber has grown into one of the most valuable start-ups in Silicon Valley, with outposts around the world. It has raised about $1.5 billion and is valued at more than $17 billion, with the inevitable talk of a public offering. Uber’s hard-charging culture is in many ways characteristic of start-ups in general. But fostering such a culture can become a losing proposition faster than you might imagine. “The dangerous thing in tech is a narrative,” said Jan Dawson, an independent industry analyst. “The more stories that come out about Uber behaving badly — whether it’s about the way it competes with rivals or the fact that an executive discussed looking into journalists — the risk is that it starts to become the main story about the company, rather than the great service it provides or its low prices.” On Tuesday afternoon, after the journalist-spying story had captivated much of Silicon Valley’s clubby tech press, Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, made an apologetic  “Emil’s comments at the recent dinner party were terrible and do not represent the company,” Mr. Kalanick  Technology companies live and die by culture; “culture eats strategy for breakfast” is among the most cherished sayings in Silicon Valley. What that means is that a company’s ultimate success or failure is determined less by anodyne technological prowess than by the values and behavior of people who work there. This may be particularly true for Uber, which is in many ways an incorporeal company. It owns no cars, its drivers are at-will contractors who can easily switch to rival services, and its customers are just one tap away from some other service. What’s more, though it is growing quickly, it is still young, and many people haven’t ever used one of its cars. If Uber’s brand becomes associated with bad behavior, what’s to stop people from choosing its rival Lyft — or from just hailing a taxi? Uber has recently been dogged by accusations of various sorts. Last New Year’s Eve, a driver hit an immigrant family in San Francisco,  Meanwhile, some drivers have protested over their wages and working conditions. And this summer,  Mr. Kalanick later  Some passengers have also worried whether the company  Still, the new revelations could increase that fear. The idea that a senior executive at the company thought it would be fine to publicly reveal a plan for spying makes you wonder if anything is considered off-limits at Uber — and that may be the sort of deep-seated worry that an apologetic series of tweets can’t do much to fix. Uber and its investors believe that the company’s long-term mission is to reinvent transportation, to become not just a taxi service but also a replacement for private cars. That mission can be realized only if people trust the company implicitly and automatically. Mr. Dawson noted that Uber wasn’t in any serious danger of losing it all. It will surely keep growing, at least for the foreseeable future. The trouble may come when Lyft and other rivals become a more dominant force in a larger share of Uber’s markets. “In places like San Francisco, where you have an abundance of options for ride-sharing, this is more likely to affect people’s willingness to use Uber,” he said. “In other places right now, people may not have much of a choice.” Uber wouldn’t be the first start-up to see its early success overshadowed by problems with its culture and image. Consider Myspace, the once fast-growing social network whose rise was  Myspace’s problems left a wide opening for a more disciplined start-up to take over social networking — an opportunity that Facebook was happy to exploit. During its subsequent rapid rise, Facebook, too, was often the subject of outrage by its users over the indiscriminate way it seemed to alter people’s privacy settings. But brushes with users eventually prompted a shift in tone by the company. Today, Facebook takes pains to offer plenty of warning to people about changes to its privacy options, and when it introduces products — like a new location-sharing app — it often leads its marketing pitch  “I think that there’s a lesson there for Uber,” said Mark Rogowsky, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has closely followed the battle between Lyft and Uber. “Uber today is at the stage where Facebook was several years ago — they’re growing ridiculously fast, and we’re all wondering whether this will be the moment that they see they need to make a change.” He added, “We just don’t know yet.”
