The Unrepentant Bootlegger
Hana Beshara remembers her time with a popular illegal video downloading site as one of adventure and camaraderie, although she wound up spending time in prison.
===
Early in the morning of June 30, 2010, Hana Beshara woke to a sharp rapping on the door of her condo in East Brunswick, N.J. “I heard a bang-bang-bang,” she said. “I’m thinking it’s, like, Amazon.” It wasn’t a delivery. It was a team of federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security, wearing bulletproof jackets and carrying guns. She sank into her couch and watched as they went through her belongings, confiscating files, her flat-screen TV, several computers and cellphones, her PlayStation 3 — anything with a hard drive. Ms. Beshara was one of the founders of a site called NinjaVideo, which at the time was one of the most popular places online to illegally stream and download TV shows and movies. At its peak, the site attracted 2.6 million visitors a day and had around 60,000 registered members, many of whom visited the website’s community section to discuss topics as diverse as philosophy, parenting and politics. Under the nickname Queen Phara, Ms. Beshara held court in these forums, where she was known for her hot-tempered and playful online personality. NinjaVideo had a short life: It went live in February 2008 and was yanked offline after the raid in June 2010. But its audacity was dazzling — impressive, even. The layout was simple: a single, scrolling web page with the names of popular television shows that were shown on cable and network television channels that week. Clicking on show titles — like “The Colbert Report” or “Lost” — caused a video player to open, and the show would begin. Watching illegal downloads was almost as simple as flipping on the TV. Few who used it were surprised when it was shuttered. To the government, Ms. Beshara was a thief, plain and simple. The  Ms. Beshara, however, still can’t accept that what she was doing deserved the heavy hammer of the law. She served 16 months in prison for conspiracy and criminal copyright infringement, but she still talks about NinjaVideo as something grand. It was a portal that spirited her away from the doldrums of her regular life as a receptionist living with her parents to an online community that regarded her as its queen. Sure, she showed movies that were still playing in theaters, but it seemed like harmless, small-stakes fun. “In hindsight — I know it’s naïve — but I never imagined it going criminal,” she said. “It didn’t seem like it was something to be bothered with. Even if it is wrong.” She is not the only one who feels that way. It has proved very difficult to reverse a pervasive cultural nonchalance about what constitutes intellectual property theft on the web. Despite the government crackdown in 2010 and subsequent efforts to unplug websites that host or link to illegal content, new sites have emerged that filled the void that NinjaVideo left behind. Online piracy is thriving. File-sharing, most of it illegal, still amounts to nearly a quarter of all consumer Internet traffic, according to Cisco Systems’  Congressional efforts, like a proposed Stop Online Piracy Act (or SOPA) introduced in 2011, met with such strident objections from the technology industry that lawmakers backed down. The Copyright Alert System, a voluntary effort by Internet service providers, sends warnings when downloading of copyrighted content is detected, but it is widely considered to be ineffective. Last year, 1.3 million warnings were sent, a fraction of what Tru Optik estimates to be 400 million illegal downloads in the United States each month. The situation has reached an uneasy stasis that pleases no one. Internet advocates say that policing individuals or small-time pirates with outdated laws ignores how ordinary people view entertainment in the real world. And despite its best efforts, the M.P.A.A. has yet to completely extinguish the unauthorized distribution of movies and television shows. A Bootleg Epiphany After she got out of prison in April 2013, Ms. Beshara, now 32, lived with her parents. But she recently moved into an apartment in Newark with a woman she met on Craigslist. Ms. Beshara’s room is spacious but bare, containing just a mattress on the floor and a few decorative items, including a blanket she knitted in prison and artwork created by members of the NinjaVideo community. In person, Ms. Beshara is prone to tears when talking about her past but she makes jokes about it as well: An email exchange between Ms. Beshara and her lawyers, forwarded to me, had the line, “It’s me, your favorite convict!” Ms. Beshara spent her early years in Brooklyn, the child of Egyptian immigrants. When she wasn’t studying, she helped out at her parents’ car service company, dispatching rides. “I didn’t have much of a childhood,” she said, sitting on the edge of her mattress and dressed in a burnt-orange wrap, smoking a clove cigarette. She remembers clearly the day she came across a man selling copies of “The Lion King” on the street for $10. Watching it, she realized that it had been made by someone covertly filming it in theaters. “I remember thinking that they were a hero,” she said. “That was my first bootleg moment.” A few years later, her parents moved the family to Parlin, N.J., and Ms. Beshara graduated from Sayreville War Memorial High School as valedictorian. She enrolled in New York University and, in 2003, graduated with a degree in political science. Her future looked bright: She dreamed about a career as a diplomat, or as an important political figure, perhaps. But after college, she returned home and drifted. She worked as a bartender and then as a receptionist in a dentist’s office, a job that one of her mother’s friends arranged as a favor. “I was figuring out what I wanted to do with myself,” she said. One night, while driving, she was pulled over. The police officer found marijuana in her car, and she was charged with possession and later put on probation for a year. The ordeal sent her into depression. “I felt like I was a step behind everyone,” Ms. Beshara said. The Internet became her escape. Ms. Beshara spent hours bingeing on shows like the science-fiction drama “Battlestar Galactica” and eventually frequented chat rooms where people uploaded shows and movies. Eventually, she started doing the same. During this period, she met Matthew Smith, then 21 and living in North Carolina. The two decided to build a different kind of streaming site, one with high-quality files and with chat forums interlaced with the content. Ms. Beshara would manage and moderate the forums; Mr. Smith would handle the technical back end. NinjaVideo went up on February 2008. Within the first couple of weeks, there were a few thousand videos on the site, largely from volunteers. “It started to blow up very, very quickly,” Ms. Beshara said. Josh Evans, one of NinjaVideo’s administrators, hired in December 2009, said that working on the site was one of the “funnest times of my life.” He lived outside Seattle and remembers traveling to New York and Greece to meet Ms. Beshara and the other NinjaVideo administrators; the gang even exchanged gifts around Christmas. “We were all a bit intoxicated with each other,” Ms. Beshara said. By day, Ms. Beshara went through the motions of her job. After work, she made a beeline for her computer, where she sometimes stayed until dawn. She logged into NinjaVideo and Skype, where she and the other moderators coordinated the shows going online that evening. They waited for their network of uploaders, who used special software to tape shows directly from television and upload them to a cyberlocker, or hosting site. From there, shows and movies would be posted on NinjaVideo. “It was an internal race to get the shows up,” Ms. Beshara said. Each night, on average, 10 to 15 shows went online. The forums were particularly active at night, and that’s when Ms. Beshara came alive as Queen Phara. “She was a bit intimidating,” said Candee Edwards, a former comment moderator for NinjaVideo, a “ ‘you either love her or you hate her’ kind of deal. If you said something stupid, you would get called out. But she was always on point, always on top of things.” ‘A Culture of Free’ Unknown to Ms. Beshara and her collaborators, NinjaVideo had been targeted by the Motion Picture Association of America, which says the site aided in the infringement of millions of dollars’ worth of copyrighted movies, television programs and software products. NinjaVideo went live the same year as Hulu and Netflix Instant, Netflix’s video streaming service, and the M.P.A.A. was trying to reroute Internet users to legitimate online streaming outlets like them. The M.P.A.A. identified what it saw as other offending sites, too, like NinjaThis.com and TVShack.net, and funneled the names to the government. Eventually, those sites went offline as well. In a nationwide campaign called Operation In Our Sites, undercover federal agents investigated and found dozens of movies on NinjaVideo, including some still in theaters. The agents didn’t need to dig deep to prove that Ms. Beshara and her collaborators were aware that their activity was illegal. Dozens of threads on the site gleefully acknowledged — even gloated over — the illicit nature of the content. Like Ms. Beshara, Mr. Evans had his home raided in 2010. He pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and copyright infringement and was sentenced to six months in federal prison in Connecticut. Now 37, Mr. Evans has returned to his home near Seattle, where he works as a computer and electronics repairman. Mr. Smith, who could not be reached to be interviewed, was sentenced to 14 months in prison for conspiracy and criminal copyright infringement. Administrators of NinjaVideo were the first to be charged criminally as a result of Operation In Our Sites; numerous other domain names would be seized and a handful of arrests made. In 2012, the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had their splashiest success: They seized and shut down Megaupload, the popular digital locker site that allowed people to share files like movies and music anonymously, and arrested its owner, Kim Dotcom, along with several other high-level executives. They have been indicted by the United States on charges related to copyright infringement, although many legal experts are not sure if a case will ever come to court. After the seizure of NinjaVideo and the other sites, the M.P.A.A. pushed federal legislation to continue to crack down on illegal downloading. But the bill, SOPA, was so loosely worded that it could have required all websites to be responsible for monitoring their services for potential violations — an expensive and nearly impossible challenge — prompting sites like Wikipedia, Tumblr and Craigslist to rally online sentiment against the legislation. Outrage about the bill came to a head in 2012, and lawmakers backed off. Operation In Our Sites still exists, primarily focused on trying to prosecute the Megaupload case. But the campaign didn’t stop unauthorized viewing. Instead, the next generation of rogue services — including Popcorn Time, which TechCrunch, a technology blog, described as “Netflix for pirates” — learned from the mistakes of sites like NinjaVideo. Operating primarily on American soil, NinjaVideo was especially vulnerable to prosecution. Newer sites established themselves overseas, out of the American government’s reach. They also tended to avoid forums and incriminating public statements that prosecutors could use against them. The M.P.A.A., meanwhile, says it is not pursuing any new legislation to crack down on copyright infringement online, focusing instead on educating consumers about legal streaming options. “The goal is not so much to use mitigation factors to stop them from pirating, but showing them the alternatives that are out there,” said Michael D. Robinson, the chief of operations and content protection for the M.P.A.A. “We are working on getting young people to understand the importance and value of copyright protection.” But that task, he said, is “unfortunately, at this point, never-ending.” “It is difficult to compete with free,” he added. That said, the M.P.A.A. says that the number of legitimate streaming outlets has doubled, to 100, since 2009, and that Americans legally consumed 5.7 billion movies and 56 billion TV shows in 2013 alone. People watch more paid, legal content than ever, but they also continue to download huge amounts of illegal content. “Piracy is putting pressure on antiquated business models, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing,” said  Even if it were possible to shut down every illegal site tomorrow, new ones would surely pop up. The demand is there.  “The farther removed you feel from the source,” he said, “the more likely you are to disregard the copyright and the intellectual property.” There is another obstacle to stopping illegal downloads, said Andre Swanston, the chief executive of Tru Optik, the media analytics firm. People want access to everything, anytime, and there is little to stop them from having it. “Even if you added Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime, Sony Crackle and everything else combined, that is still less content available legally than illegally,” he said. “The popularity of piracy has nothing to do with cost — it is all about access.” Complex exclusivity agreements between networks and streaming sites govern when popular television shows are available. But people are not always willing to hop among a streaming service, a site or an app to watch different shows. Mr. Swanston gave the example of how ABC in January started requiring people to verify that they had a cable subscription to watch its shows on Hulu. Users either didn’t have the necessary information or declined to go the extra step, it seems, because the rate of piracy for “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” a network drama, shot up 300 percent. Content providers, Mr. Swanston says, will eventually have to consider new delivery models that are more closely aligned with how people behave. He imagines collaborations with streaming services to release content or simultaneously scheduling theater and digital streaming releases — ideas he hopes his company can help bring about. Some companies, like BitTorrent, which makes file-sharing technology, are already experimenting in this arena. The law, too, needs to adapt to the reality of how people behave, said Peter Eckersley, technology projects director at the  Mr. Eckersley said the law should shift its focus to making sure that copyright holders are paid for their work, rather than trying to stymie how people gain access to it. Subscription-based music services like Rdio and Spotify seem to be helping prevent music piracy — although the argument about whether artists are fairly compensated rages on. He suggested a legal framework to retire the “exclusive rights” aspect of copyright law that requires permission to publish — and that allows copyright holders to seek exorbitant damages from infringers — and move toward a system that requires sites and people who make money from another’s work to share any profits. Solutions like these, Mr. Eckersley says, would create different priorities that go beyond chasing small-time pirates like Ms. Beshara and her colleagues. NinjaVideo made about $500,000 over three years, according to the government. Most of that came from advertising, but also from donations and a $25 fee for access to private chat boards. Ms. Beshara kept the bulk of the pot, around $210,000, which she is required to pay back to the M.P.A.A. (She says she netted only about half of that but she is gradually repaying the amount.) The rest was divided among four other co-founders and administrators who helped run the site and manage the community. She acknowledges that some of her colleagues were upset when they learned she received much of the profit from NinjaVideo, but says it wasn’t out of line with her role as the voice of the site. “People took issue with the fact that I got paid,” she said. At any rate, in her opinion, the money was insignificant. To this day, she argues that the movie business is so big that skimming a little off the top doesn’t hurt anybody. She likes to say that NinjaVideo was operating in a “gray area.” Ms. Beshara refused to muster any remorse during her sentencing and often took to social media between court appearances to boast about her lack of repentance. This enraged the judge presiding over her case. David Smith, one of the lawyers appointed to represent Ms. Beshara, compared her behavior to that of another class of clients he often works with: drug traffickers. The thrill is similar, he said, and many find themselves addicted to the lifestyle, even more than the profits. “A lot of them are in it for the sheer joy of doing it,” Mr. Smith said. “There’s a lot of excitement and ego gratification in being a successful trafficker.” The Thrill Is Gone Prison wasn’t easy for Ms. Beshara. She got into scuffles with other inmates, including one that landed her in solitary confinement for a month. She learned to crochet and taught a jewelry-making class. She worked in the prison kitchen, preparing food for a few cents an hour. Her family didn’t visit. NinjaVideo community members, including Ms. Edwards, the moderator, supplied Ms. Beshara with phone cards and put money in her commissary account so she could buy basic items like shampoo and snacks. After 16 months in prison, Ms. Beshara spent an additional five at a halfway house in New Jersey. Her parole prohibits her from corresponding with her former NinjaVideo colleagues or from starting a business online until August 2015. “All said and done, it’s about five years before I’m allowed to really be back online,” she said. “They hurt me with that.” She works full time as human resources manager at an Internet sales company that she likes fine enough, and on the weekends she shuttles across town to a food co-op where she makes coffees and vegetable wraps as part of her mandatory community service. Her new life lacks the excitement and thrill of NinjaVideo, but when she lapses into thinking about the “old days,” she lights up with excitement and longing. “I would never take it back,” she said.
