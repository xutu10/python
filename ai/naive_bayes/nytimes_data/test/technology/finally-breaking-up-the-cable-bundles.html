Finally Breaking Up the Cable Bundles
Trying to recalculate monthly bills by paying separate companies for high-speed Internet, cable television and landline telephone service.
===
I’M in a relationship that just hasn’t been working out. I still want to be connected, just not as connected as before. I’m breaking up with my cable company. Like millions of other people, I am a longtime “triple play” customer, relying on one cable company — Comcast, in my case — for a bundle of services including high-speed Internet, cable television and landline telephone. There is a convenience factor in having a single company provide all of these services, and for the most part, my service has been reliable over the years. Cable companies have long said that customers receive the best deal by subscribing to all three services. Over time, though, I have grown weary of Comcast’s bundle pricing, which can soar after promotional periods expire. Even more irritating is that my cable company lumps the three services into one price on my monthly bill, making it difficult to tell what I’m paying for each service. That, in turn, makes it difficult to shop with other providers, many of which offer compelling alternatives. Marcien Jenckes, a Comcast executive vice president, said that greater transparency on pricing was something that its customers wanted and that Comcast was working on new designs for its bills to help in that regard. “There is lots we can do and room still for improvement to make that clearer,” he said. “Our point of view is it should be very straightforward to see what our customers are paying for our services.” I have company in my frustration with this state of affairs. Customer satisfaction with cable television companies and Internet service providers is among the lowest of any industry, according to a  One big provider, Time Warner Cable, has  I set out to determine how significantly I could lower my monthly bill by busting up my cable bundle. This approach won’t work for everyone. If you want to watch the latest HBO shows and crave live television, including news and sports, sticking with your cable bundle may make the most sense. Inertia has kept me from doing this sooner. But when I looked at my Comcast bill a couple of months ago, I knew it was time to move. My total bill, including my bundle of services, equipment and taxes, had jumped to more than $290 a month from just over $190. My cable company has long offered promotional pricing that lasts for two years. If I committed to stay with the service for that period, my bill typically went up modestly after one year and then spiked more sharply after two. I then had to call Comcast to see what promotions it could offer me and commit again to another two-year contract. This time, my cable bill jumped to a much higher level than ever before, and the promotional prices Comcast offered me when I called customer support recently were not as generous as in the past. Before my old promotional price expired this year, I paid $130 a month for my bundle, before taxes and other charges. I was offered a new promotional price of $160 for the first year and $180 for the year after that. Craig Moffett, an analyst who follows the cable industry for MoffettNathanson Research, said this ritual of forcing consumers to negotiate for a better deal backfired on cable companies. “Unfortunately, rather than leaving the customer delighted that they just saved money, you leave them disenchanted and feeling like it was only through cunning that they were able to avoid getting hosed,” Mr. Moffett said. I’m sticking with Comcast for the one service I can’t really replace: high-speed Internet access. Other residential Internet providers in my neighborhood in Seattle don’t offer anything close to the downloading speeds of 50 megabits per second that I now get with Comcast. I’m still in the process of unbundling, but once I drop Comcast television and telephone service, my bill for high-speed Internet will go to about $85 a month, not including taxes, according to customer support. Ninety days after switching to just Internet service, I will be eligible for a promotional price that will most likely bring my Comcast bill down another $25 or so, customer support told me. While unbundling may minimize the swings in monthly bills, promotional prices are inescapable. For phone service, I have many more options, the most inexpensive of which is to simply drop landline service altogether and use my cellphone. Nearly 40 percent of American households rely entirely on wireless phone service, according to a  I favor the clarity of landlines. In fact, I’ve long had two of them through Comcast — one for work and one for personal use — which added $22 a month to my bill on top of my basic bundle price. I decided to replace my two Comcast lines with an Internet telephone service from Ooma, which has earned plaudits for its reliability and value. It requires the purchase of a $150 device called Telo ($120 after a service activation credit from the company). After that investment, Ooma offers unlimited nationwide calling at no cost, charging customers only for taxes and fees, which are typically range $4 to $7 a month. I signed up for a $10-a-month “premier” service from Ooma that gives me two phone lines. So far, I have been delighted by the service, including nice features that let me screen voice mail messages live and ring my landline and mobile numbers simultaneously. I haven’t decided yet how I’m going to replace my Comcast television service. One satellite television provider, Dish Network, currently charges $85 a month for 12 months, and $125 after that, for a package that most closely resembles the one I have with Comcast, which includes HBO and other premium channels. Fees for digital video recorder service and equipment for a second television will increase the monthly bill by $19. How much, if anything, will I save by splitting up my bundle? If I kept my bundle of services with Comcast, I estimate my total monthly bill, including my second phone line, taxes and other fees, would be about $230 for the first year and $260 after that. By going with Comcast for high-speed Internet, Ooma for phone and Dish for television, my bill could be as low as $200 a month with the promotional prices I have been quoted. When they expire, and assuming I can’t get new promotional prices to replace them, my monthly bill could be closer to $270, a bit more than sticking with Comcast. I also have to factor in the $120 for the Ooma Telo device in my calculations, though that is a one-time fee that will eventually pay for itself in savings by the end of the year. In reality, my monthly savings will be far greater because I am unlikely to sign up for a costly television package like the one I have from Comcast. Like many people, more of my viewing time has gravitated to Netflix, which I can stream through my Internet service on plans that start at $8 a month. Amazon just added many of HBO’s older original shows to its Prime Instant Video streaming service, though not the latest ones like “Game of Thrones.” I already have Prime Instant Video because it’s part of Amazon’s broader $99-a-year Prime membership program, which includes free two-day shipping on orders. Comcast has responded to the growth of these streaming services, especially their attractive user interfaces, with a new set-top box called X1. If I forgo a bare-bones pay TV package, the real loss will be live television. Hard-core sports fans find the idea of cord-cutting difficult to stomach. I mostly watch only big events, like the Super Bowl and the Olympics, that are shown on broadcast television, which you can tune into free with the purchase of an HD antenna (usually less than $100). Of course, unbundling takes some serious effort, and it does come with a potential deal breaker for some in the lack of live TV. For me, though, the cost savings — and the visibility of how much I’m paying for individual services — makes it well worth the exercise.
