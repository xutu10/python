Out of Tragedy, a Protective Glass for Schools
The killer at Sandy Hook Elementary School shot through a window, a detail that stuck with the co-founder of School Guard Glass, maker of a strong glass intended to thwart intruders.

In the two years since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., schools across the country have become more serious about safety. They have bought familiar items like surveillance cameras, panic buttons and key-card entry systems. More recent innovations include bulletproof whiteboards to help teachers shield students inside classrooms and a smartphone app that starts a school lockdown with the swipe of a finger. By 2017, the market for school security systems is expected to hit $4.9 billion, up from $2.7 billion in 2012, according  One suggested strategy for preventing school tragedies is to delay attackers outside school buildings until law enforcement officers arrive at the scene. To that end, a start-up company in Adams, Mass., called  For context, it took the first police officer about three minutes to get to Sandy Hook Elementary School after the initial 911 call, and, within the next minute, several more officers arrived. Once there, they discovered a gaping hole, created by gunfire, in a window next to the front door. The idea for School Guard Glass came just two weeks after the Sandy Hook shooting, which claimed the lives of 20 children and six staff members. Christopher Kapiloff, a co-owner of his family’s business,  “For three days, I couldn’t sleep,” Mr. Kapiloff says of his reaction to the shooting. “I internalized it to a degree I’ve never internalized an event like that before.” Because he was in the glass-installation business, it didn’t escape him that the Newtown killer had entered Sandy Hook by shooting through a window. A majority of the clients of Kapiloff’s Glass are businesses and schools, but for the last decade it has also teamed up with a materials lamination company,  “Our company has installed doors for the federal government that you could stand five feet away from with an AK-47,” Mr. Kapiloff says. “You could put 30 rounds right into the center of the glass and not one would penetrate the door.” Given his experience with schools and high-security buildings, Mr. Kapiloff took on the challenge he couldn’t shake from his mind: finding an affordable way to keep violent intruders out of schools for those crucial first few minutes. Working with the LTI Group, he began developing a thin glass that, while it can crack, stays intact when bullets or blunt objects like bats or sledgehammers strike it. In spring 2013, he and Jeff Besse, co-owner of the LTI Group, founded School Guard Glass. They began selling the glass early this year; so far, sales have totaled about $750,000, and the company has $1.25 million in orders for 2015, Mr. Kapiloff says. The glass, which has a strong center, functions more like the bulletproof glass found in banks and other high-security buildings than the tempered glass that’s commonly used in car windows — or that crumbled into pieces at Sandy Hook Elementary School. But whereas bulletproof glass is typically thick, heavy and expensive, the School Guard Glass is relatively thin and lightweight. Bulletproof glass ranges from three-quarters of an inch to By contrast, School Guard Glass is a quarter-inch thick, and the price per door, including installation, is about $1,000 to $1,200. The glass is lightweight enough that it can be used to replace glass in existing doors and window panes. Mr. Kapiloff would not reveal the exact contents of the glass, except to say the secret ingredient is in the inner layer. “It’s very effective in mitigating blast damage,” he says, adding that he has applied for several patents.But according to Jim Crumbley, an independent school security expert and a volunteer with the nonprofit  Focusing on daily threats, like a stranger trying to take a student out of school or crime from the local community spilling onto the campus, can be a better use of a school’s limited financial resources than preparing for a mass shooting, he says. To Philip Santore, a security expert, School Guard Glass is “a game-changer.” Mr. Santore was a co-founder of  Several months ago, School Guard Glass hired an independent agency that specializes in testing ballistics resistance in glass. Mr. Santore observed the session, during which testers shot at the glass with an assault rifle, then threw bricks at it and struck it with various other weapons, including a two-by-four, hammers, tire irons, a sledgehammer, an aluminum baseball bat and steel-toe boots. The glass held up for more than 10 minutes, according to Mr. Santore. “My job is to keep someone out of the building,” he says. “And that’s what this glass does.”
