Shopping for Flair? The Moto X Smartphone Fits the Bill
Motorola is introducing the new Moto X model hoping to lure Android shoppers with something a bit different.

MOST phones look about the same. Without a case, they are flat rectangles with slightly rounded edges and they come in black, white and occasionally gold. With its new Moto X smartphone, Motorola is hoping that noticeable custom design and some clever software features will woo Android shoppers looking for something a little different. This Moto X is actually the second generation. The first one, released in August 2013, was the first phone produced after Google acquired Motorola Mobility for almost $13 billion. Despite good design and innovative features, the phone had some middling specs and a disappointing camera. It also cost the same as phones like the iPhone 5S and Galaxy S5, and buyers were put off. Now, Motorola is in the process of being sold to Lenovo for $2.9 billion. But the company still managed to make the new Moto X an appealing option. The phone offers top-of-the-line specs, a lovely 5.2-inch display, a sleek, premium design that still fits in a pocket and has extras that make it fun to use. And it is priced lower than other flagship phones. It is $99 with some contracts. Motorola is also taking advantage of its Google relationship by promising quick updates to the Android operating system. And Motorola hasn’t cluttered the Android interface with custom touches the way Samsung and HTC do. (Although AT&T; managed to install eight separate apps on my review device.) That means it’s very close to running “pure Android,” which is what fans of the operating system call the clean, uncluttered version that runs on Google’s Nexus phones. As a result, the phone is faster and easier to navigate than Samsung phones with their proprietary TouchWiz interface and myriad extra apps. The phone itself is comfortably shaped with a rounded back cover that makes it easier to grip. It’s lightweight, and its materials and construction feel solid and pleasing. The phone’s design is immensely customizable, too. On the company’s  My review unit came with a dark brown leather back that smelled like a leather shop and lent the phone a distinctive air. Depending on the carrier, you can buy the leather, black plastic or bamboo models in the store or order a custom design from color palates displayed in the store. Inside the body, the Moto X has the same processor as the one found in the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the HTC One M8, and performance is noticeably snappy. It has a good-size battery that delivers a comfortable day’s worth of use. The 5.2-inch display is large and bright, but there’s hardly any bezel on either side of the phone, so the phone still feels trim. And the phone’s software incorporates gestures for silencing incoming calls, displaying some notifications and activating the camera. You hold it in your hand and twist your wrist to immediately launch the camera (This feature was in the last model, as well). Some options are a little gimmicky. I could never get the proper distance to decline a call by waving my hand. But the camera twist works well and the 13-megapixel camera itself is much improved and faster, although it’s slower to focus than its competition, especially the new iPhones. I liked its ambient notifications mode, which shows icons for incoming mail or texts. Tapping the icon previews the message content without unlocking the phone. Other software improvements include the Moto Voice controls, which are fuller featured than Android’s built-in voice commands. You can create a custom phrase to wake up the phone, like, “O.K., manservant.” And phrases like “What’s up?” elicit a spoken list of recent activity, like emails and calendar appointments. Software called Motorola Connect lets you see and send text messages and answer or decline calls from your computer. Apple’s new desktop and mobile operating systems offer a similar feature called Continuity. On the Moto X, you turn on the app on your phone, then download an extension to the Chrome browser. The feature works on Macs or PCs, but only in the Chrome browser. It’s extremely useful. Over all, the Moto X is an appealing phone, especially for people who want their devices to sport a distinctive design. And it’s inexpensive. It may get buried in a sea of bigger names, but those seeking a little variety should seek it out.
