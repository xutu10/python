Hewlett-Packard Profit Slips as Breakup Plan Begins
Sales were down for many key products, but Meg Whitman, the chief executive, was upbeat about her plans to turn around the company.

Hewlett-Packard Meg Whitman “We stabilized revenue trajectory,” she said in a release accompanying the earnings. “There is still a lot to do.” HP, based in Palo Alto, Calif., reported that net earnings in the fourth quarter fell 6 percent to $1.3 billion, or 70 cents a share, from the year-ago quarter. The company said revenue fell 2 percent, to $28.4 billion. Using nonstandard accounting popular among tech companies, HP had per-share earnings of $1.06. This was even with the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected $1.06 cents a share and revenue of $28.7 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. For the year, HP reported net income of $5 billion, or $2.62 a share, and revenue of $111.5 billion, a drop of 1 percent from a year ago. The company also declared a cash dividend of 16 cents per share of its common stock. HP shares were down about 1.6 percent in early after-hours trading. In October, Ms. Whitman announced that by November 2015 HP would split into two companies. One, called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, includes computer servers and data storage equipment, along with software and services. As its name indicates, it will sell technology mostly to larger businesses. The other, selling personal computers and printers to both business and consumers, will be called HP Inc. Ms. Whitman, who has said the move is about giving both groups more speed and agility in responding to increasingly different markets, will be chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and will serve as nonexecutive chairwoman of HP Inc.
