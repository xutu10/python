You’ve probably heard musicians like Neil Young complain over the last few years about the sound quality of digital music.

LouderLogic,  ALX makes tones sound much warmer and vocals seem brighter. It gave movies theater-quality sound, even on headphones.

LouderLogic, DFX Player and Headquake may not appeal to audiophiles because the processing they apply to music has such a bold effect on its sound. On iOS, a slightly more subtle and gentle effect  If all this talk of advanced music processing makes you uncomfortable, simpler audio enhancement is possible with equalizer apps like Equalizer by Audioforge  Quick Call Fitness app experts Runtastic have added a new dimension to their health-measuring powers: Sleep quality, via the new Sleep Better app. The app uses your phone’s sensors to assess your sleep behavior to try to help you sleep better, and it’s free on
