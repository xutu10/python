WASHINGTON —  The company is the third major mobile phone carrier, after AT&T; and Sprint, to settle with regulators over the practice, known as cramming, in which consumers are billed, often for $9.99 a month, for services like horoscopes, love tips and celebrity gossip. T-Mobile agreed to pay $18 million in fines and penalties to the attorneys general of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and to pay $4.5 million in penalties to the Federal Communications Commission. In addition, T-Mobile must pay full refunds to all affected consumers under an agreement reached with the Federal Trade Commission. Total payments under the agreements, including the penalties and refunds, must total at least $90 million; there is no upper limit, however, on T-Mobile’s liability for refunds. T-Mobile did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “Mobile cramming is an issue that has affected millions of American consumers, and I’m pleased that this settlement will put money back in the hands of affected T-Mobile customers,” Edith Ramirez, the F.T.C. chairwoman, said. “Consumers should be able to trust that their mobile phone bills reflect the charges they authorized and nothing more.” The F.T.C. accused T-Mobile of charging customers for services that had refund rates of up to 40 percent in a single month, indicating that many of those customers who saw the charges on their bills knew they had not requested the service. But the trade commission said that T-Mobile also made it “nearly impossible for consumers to find and understand the third-party subscription charges” because they were buried deep in phone bills that totaled more than 50 pages in length.
