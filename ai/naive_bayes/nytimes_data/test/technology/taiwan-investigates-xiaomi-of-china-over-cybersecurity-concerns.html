Taiwan Investigates Xiaomi of China Over Cybersecurity Concerns
The inquiry is a reminder of the scrutiny that Chinese technology firms are subject to abroad, as governments become wary of cybersecurity threats.

TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan’s government is investigating whether Xiaomi, China’s leading smartphone company by domestic shipments, is a cybersecurity threat, according to a government website. It was not immediately clear whether the investigation could lead to a ban for Xiaomi’s low-priced smartphones in Taiwan. A decision would be made within three months, the Taiwan government said. Some Xiaomi phones automatically send user data to the firm’s servers in Beijing, where the company is based, potentially leading to security breaches, according to the statement posted Tuesday on the website of Taiwan’s executive branch. The inquiry is a reminder of the scrutiny Chinese technology firms are subject to abroad, as governments become increasingly wary of potential cybersecurity threats from China, the world’s second-biggest economy. China’s government and companies are frequently accused of industrial espionage and cyberespionage. Concerns are also mounting that Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province, is overreliant on the mainland. Critics of Beijing argue that expanding economic ties allow China to influence Taiwan’s fiercely democratic politics. The statement added that the popular Japanese instant messaging service Line, owned by Naver of South Korea, would be banned from use on government work-related computers, also because of security concerns. A Line spokeswoman based in Tokyo said the company was investigating the matter, but would not provide more details. Xiaomi declined to comment. The smartphone maker recently came under fire for unauthorized data access, spurring the company to upgrade its operating system and let users refuse to allow it to collect information from their address books. Although the vast majority of the company’s sales are in China, Xiaomi has set up shop elsewhere in Asia, including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and India. It is also weighing expansion into countries such as Thailand, Brazil and Mexico. Trade ties between China and Taiwan have skyrocketed in recent years, though Taiwan still often views Chinese firms with suspicion.
