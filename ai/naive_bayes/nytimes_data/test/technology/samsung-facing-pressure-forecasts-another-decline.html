Samsung, Facing Pressure, Forecasts Another Decline
The smartphone maker said it expected a fourth straight quarter of declining profit as competition mounted in China and elsewhere.

For Samsung Electronics, the South Korean smartphone maker, the poor results keep coming. The company said in a short statement on Tuesday that its operating profit and sales probably fell from July through September compared with the same period a year earlier, an indication of the growing pressure it faces from competitors. The forecast, which was well below analyst estimates, added gloom to a tough year for the company. Samsung has now posted four consecutive quarters of decline in operating profit. Ascendant Chinese smartphone makers are putting pressure on the company by offering a range of cheap smartphones in developing markets. At the same time, Apple’s new cooperation with carriers in Japan and China has helped spur sales. Analysts also say the new, larger  Samsung said Tuesday it expected an operating profit of about 4.1 trillion won, or $3.8 billion, in the period from July through September, down 60 percent from 10.2 trillion won a year earlier. Sales totaled about 47 trillion won, down 20 percent from 59.1 trillion a year earlier. The guidance comes ahead of final third-quarter results expected to be released at the end of October. Lee Min-hee, an analyst at IM Investment and Securities, said he expected Samsung to give a makeover to its lower-cost phones to address the competition, potentially introducing handsets with metal casings later this year. “Samsung’s profits in the mobile division will continue to deteriorate during this period of changing their line of smartphones,” he said. In China, the world’s largest smartphone market by number of phones sold, Samsung slid to second in market share in the period from April through June behind the Chinese company Xiaomi, according to the research firm Canalys. “With the market in China becoming even more competitive, it will not be straightforward to re-establish leadership” for Samsung, Canalys wrote in a report. The top eight Chinese smartphone vendors in the country controlled 65 percent of the market, the report said. Samsung moved up the release in China of its new Galaxy Note 4 to the end of September to get a head start on Apple after a regulatory delay pushed back the release of the iPhone 6 to Oct. 17, according to analysts. Still, the larger iPhone could pose a bigger challenge to Samsung than previous versions have because many Chinese buyers prefer phones with large screens. Apple said it sold 10 million iPhones globally the first weekend after it went on sale, higher than the nine million of the previous generation it sold last year. In the period from April through June, Samsung had a global smartphone market share of 25 percent, a 7 percent drop from the same period a year earlier, according to the research firm IDC. “To maintain its position at the top, Samsung will need to focus on building momentum in markets dominated by local brands,” IDC said in the report.
