With Tech Taking Over in Schools, Worries Rise
Parent groups and privacy advocates are challenging the practices of an industry built on data collection, and California has passed wide-ranging legislation protecting students’ personal information.

At a New York state elementary school, teachers can use a behavior-monitoring app to compile information on which children have positive attitudes and which act out. In Georgia, some high school cafeterias are using  Technology companies are collecting a vast amount of data about students, touching every corner of their educational lives — with few controls on how those details are used. Now California is poised to become the first state to comprehensively restrict how such information is exploited by the growing education technology industry. Legislators in the state passed a law last month prohibiting educational sites, apps and cloud services used by schools from selling or disclosing personal information about students from kindergarten through high school; from using the children’s data to market to them; and from compiling dossiers on them. The law is a response to growing parental concern that sensitive information about children — like data about learning disabilities, disciplinary problems or family trauma — might be disseminated and disclosed, potentially hampering college or career prospects. Although other states have enacted limited restrictions on such data, California’s law is the most wide-ranging. “It’s a landmark bill in that it’s the first of its kind in the country to put the onus on Internet companies to do the right thing,” said Senator Darrell Steinberg, a Democrat who wrote  Gov. Jerry Brown has not taken a public position on the measure, or on  James P. Steyer, chief executive of  “You can’t have an education technology revolution without strong privacy protections for students,” said Mr. Steyer, whose group spearheaded the passage of Mr. Steinberg’s bill. “Parents, teachers and kids can now feel confident that students’ personal information can be used only for educational achievement.” In a sign of the rapid growth of the education technology industry, even Mr. Steyer’s group has partnerships with Google, Apple, Amazon and other companies that distribute the group’s educational materials and its ratings of games and apps for children. The California effort comes at a pivotal time for the industry. Schools nationwide have been rushing to introduce everything from sophisticated online portals, which allow students to see course assignments and send messages to teachers, to reading apps that can record and assess a child’s every click. These data-driven products are designed to adapt to the abilities and pace of each child, holding out the promise of improved academic achievement. Last year, sales of education technology software for prekindergarten through 12th grade reached an estimated $7.9 billion, according to the Software and Information Industry Association. As schools embrace these personalized learning tools, however, parents across the country have started challenging the industry’s information privacy and security practices. “Different websites collect different kinds of information that could be aggregated to create a profile of a student, starting in elementary school,” said Tony Porterfield, a software engineer and father of two pre-teenage sons in Los Altos, Calif. “Can you imagine a college-admissions officer being able to access behavioral tracking information about a student, or how they did on a math app, all the way back to grade school?” Last year, parent groups and privacy advocates raised those kinds of concerns about inBloom, a student data warehouse that offered to streamline how educators and apps retrieved student information; inBloom withered in the face of that opposition,  A federal law, the  Privacy advocates say many of the details now collected by education sites and apps are not covered by the law because they do not form part of the institutional student education records maintained by schools.  Over the last year, states have introduced more than 100 bills to regulate the collection or handling of students’ information. Many are narrow in scope. Lawmakers in Florida, for instance, passed  The California measure takes a fuller approach, formally extending privacy protections to a much wider array of information than the official student education record covered by the federal law. Among other things, the California bill prohibits companies from selling, disclosing or using for marketing purposes students’ online searches, text messages, photos, voice recordings, biometric data, location information, food purchases, political or religious information, digital documents or any kind of student identification code. The idea is to prevent companies from using information about students for any activity not intended by schools. “The California statute is filling the void,” said Joel R. Reidenberg, a professor at Fordham Law School who is an expert in education privacy law. “They are modernizing the protection of student privacy for the computer era in schools.” California lawmakers did make some concessions to industry. An exception in the legislation, for instance, allows companies to use student data for “legitimate research purposes.” Last year, Senator Steinberg sponsored  But Mr. Steinberg said he thought his current effort had implications beyond education. The California student privacy measure would essentially advance a fundamental principle of data rights for everyone: that a person who agrees to let a company collect personal details about them for a specific purpose has the right to decide whether that company may subsequently use that same information for unrelated activities. “The bill sets a standard that is applicable to the larger privacy debate,” Mr. Steinberg said. “Personal information should only be used for other purposes with the permission of the individual.”
