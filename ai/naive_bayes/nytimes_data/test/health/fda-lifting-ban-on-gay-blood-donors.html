F.D.A. Lifting Ban on Gay Blood Donors
The agency will scrap a lifetime prohibition on blood donation by gay and bisexual men, but it will block donations by men who have had sex with other men in the last 12 months.

WASHINGTON — The  The F.D.A. enacted the ban in 1983, early in the  In a statement, the agency said it had “carefully examined and considered the scientific evidence” before changing the policy. It said it intended to issue a draft guidance detailing the change in 2015. The shift puts the United States on par with European countries like Britain, which adjusted its lifetime ban in favor of a 12-month restriction in 2011. Men’s health advocates welcomed the move, saying that the ban was not based on the latest science and that it perpetuated stigma about gay men as a risk to the health of the nation. Legal experts said the change brings an important national health policy in line with other legal and political rights, such as permitting gay and people to marry and to serve openly in the military. “This is a major victory for gay civil rights,” said I. Glenn Cohen, a law professor at Harvard University who specializes in bioethics and health. “We’re leaving behind the old view that every gay man is a potential infection source." He said, however, that the policy was “still not rational enough." The shift will have far-reaching implications for the nation’s blood supply. The Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, has calculated that the change could add about 317,000 pints of blood to the nation’s supply annually, an increase of 2 percent to 4 percent. About 8.5 percent of American men — or about 10 million people — report having had sex at least once with a man since turning 18, according to the Institute. The new policy will exclude the 3.8 percent of American men who report having had a male sexual partner in the past year, a group that could double the potential new supply, the institute said in a report.
