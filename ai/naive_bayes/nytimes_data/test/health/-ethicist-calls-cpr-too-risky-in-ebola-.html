 Ethicist Calls CPR Too Risky in Ebola 
The medical ethicist Dr. Joseph J. Fins says a medical team shouldn’t try CPR on an Ebola patient because the risks are too great for health care workers and even for some patients.

The Ebola crisis has prompted a leading medical ethicist to raise an uncomfortable end-of-life question that doctors may have to address sooner than they would like: Should a medical team try to resuscitate an Ebola patient whose heart stops beating? The ethicist, Dr. Joseph J. Fins, says that the answer should be no — that the risks of  And he is urging a national debate on the question now — before doctors and nurses have to make a hasty decision when an emergency code for CPR is sounded. “Every clinician in the United States would like this issue to be discussed, and we need guidance on it,” Dr. Fins, an internal-medicine specialist who is director of medical ethics at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital in Manhattan, said in an interview. He urged hospitals and government officials to develop firm guidance on the care of Ebola patients in accordance with state laws. He has posted  Health professionals are expected to try to revive patients in cardiac arrest when possible, unless a “do not resuscitate” order — arrived at after discussion with patients and families — is in their medical records. Dr. Fins said society must consider whether a blanket D.N.R. is justified for all Ebola patients, and, if so, at what stages of their illness. The issue is a new one for American hospitals and has yet to be formally debated in medical journals, scientific meetings and medical school classes. Although the magnitude of the crisis is far greater in West Africa, the ethics question has the potential to come up in the United States, where two nurses who cared for Thomas Eric Duncan before his death at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas have become infected. (The hospital said Mr. Duncan told his doctor that the medical team “should not perform chest compressions,  Other ethicists say Dr. Fins’s concerns are well taken. Laurence McCullough, a clinical ethicist at Baylor College of Medicine, called the statement “very well reasoned” and said it “reminds us that there are justified limits on the risk to health and life that health care professionals are expected to take in the care of patients.” “Self-sacrifice by health care professionals that results in no offsetting clinical benefits for the patient,” he continued, “is not required by the professional virtue of self-sacrifice.” Arthur Caplan, a professor of medical ethics at New York University, said he agreed with Dr. Fins’s views when it came to Ebola patients “in extremis.” But he said he was concerned that health workers might apply the argument even to people who show no signs of Ebola but might have come in contact with an Ebola patient. Nevertheless, he said, responders should still wear protective gear in dealing with these contacts. “Even those with incipient symptoms but not yet ravaged by Ebola have a claim” to be resuscitated, Dr. Caplan said. Dr. Fins said health professionals should assure all Ebola patients and their families that they will offer all available intensive-care and comfort measures. But he drew the line at resuscitation, for a variety of reasons: safety, staffing, logistics and futility. CPR can cause rib fractures and internal bleeding. Such complications could be more serious among those Ebola patients who experience uncontrolled bleeding. Compressing the chest during CPR could produce even more internal bleeding and cause damage to vital organs. Some Ebola patients might even bleed to death. Members of a resuscitation team would have to arrive at the bedside and consume precious minutes to carefully put on protective gear before starting CPR. Rushing the process could lead to breaches in protection measures and create a safety risk to the team members — and ultimately to all their contacts in a hospital or outside. If society expected that health workers would rush in for Ebola patients as they do for standard cardiac arrest codes, “no one would volunteer to provide care,” Dr. Fins wrote. Also, time delays from donning equipment could lead to oxygen deprivation in patients who do not already have breathing tubes in place; that can cause brain damage. To provide timely resuscitation, hospitals would need staff workers suited in protective gear around the clock. Further, hospitals would have to rotate at least two teams because of the limited amount of time an individual can safely wear protective gear. Resuscitation efforts can be chaotic even under everyday conditions, because the nearest responders must form a team on the spot. For an Ebola patient, the situation could be all the more chaotic if members of the team stopped to debate performing CPR at the bedside. Hospitals should develop policies that reflect their views on resuscitation before an Ebola patient arrives, Dr. Fins said, adding that “confronting this problem in the heat of a cardiac arrest is not the right time to be thinking about it.” From a patient’s viewpoint, Dr. Fins said, resuscitation may be futile because of the lack of specific anti-Ebola therapies — and “all the more so for patients in extremis.”
