Giving the wrong antivenin, drug or treatment can have dangerous side effects. Also, many or even most bites are from nonpoisonous snakes and no treatment beyond cleaning the wound is needed. According to  Villagers often kill snakes after a bite but then fail to take the corpse to a clinic, even though that would identify it and determine what treatment should be given. Data from  DNA could be swabbed from about a quarter of the bites and amplified, the researchers found. Folk remedies made it harder to get a viable sample, they said. When the snake was available, there was a 100 percent match. Standard DNA testing is too difficult for poor, rural clinics. But proving that it works could lead to rapid diagnostic tests, the authors said.
