New Prediction Model Could Reduce Military Suicides, Study Finds
The computer model identifies a range of factors related to suicide that could allow doctors to follow high-risk soldiers closely and take preventive measures.

Military doctors could reduce suicides among soldiers with psychiatric conditions by using a new screening system that flags those at highest risk of taking their own lives, a new study suggests. The system — a computer program that rates more than 20 actuarial factors, including age at enlistment, history of violence, and prescription drug use — would be the most rigorous suicide prediction model available, if it performs as expected in real-world settings. Most suicide screenings are questionnaires with virtually no predictive power, and are dependent on truthful answers from people who often have reason to hide their intentions. But the new study found that those it categorized as high-risk — some 5 percent of a sample of more than 40,000 soldiers who had been hospitalized for a  The risk model is not likely to be immediately useful in civilian hospitals, which do not have nearly as much personal data on patients as the military does. The findings, from a consortium of military and academic researchers, were published Wednesday by the journal JAMA Psychiatry. “The most impressive thing is that they identified this high-risk group in the hospital, and by just focusing on one in 20 of them, you’re really dramatically improving your ability to predict,” said Dr. Mark Olfson, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University who was not involved in the study. “Clinicians don’t do a very good job predicting suicide risk, even though we think we do.” The suicide prediction model is based on mining databases of military and medical data. The research team, led by Ronald C. Kessler, a professor of health care policy at Harvard, analyzed records of 40,820 soldiers who were hospitalized at least once for a mental health problem from 2004 through 2009. Doctors have long known that such patients are at risk of suicide in the months after leaving the hospital, and the researchers wanted to know what, if anything, those who did commit suicide had in common. The team began by formulating a list of more than 300 factors that could be related to risk, including age, access to weapons, military rank, run-ins with leadership, and  Some of the factors associated with higher risk were expected, like previous  “There’s this group that comes to the Army later in later in life — they’re smart, they have skills, they tend not to be married and they have no career or have left a career to join,” Dr. Kessler said. “We don’t know why they should be at higher risk, but they appear to be.” Dr. Kessler said that so-called accession waivers, in which the Army relaxed enlistment standards to shore up its ranks and therefore may have taken in people with mental health problems that would have otherwise disqualified them, had no effect on suicide risk. The new prediction program, if it can be integrated smoothly into the military’s medical system, would allow doctors to follow high-risk soldiers closely after discharge, and to take preventive measures. These include requiring outpatient therapy in the weeks after discharge; working to build social support by enlisting friends and family; and teaching coping mechanisms for when the person feels overwhelmed. “According to their estimate, we could save four lives for every hundred people we treated” with these follow-up measures, said Lt. Gen. Eric B. Schoomaker, a former surgeon general of the Army and a professor of military and emergency medicine at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md. “This would be unparalleled, compared to almost any other intervention we could make in medicine. This study begins to show the positive effects big data can have, when combined with administrative health records.”
