Gay Advocates Can Shift Same-Sex Marriage Views
Openly gay canvassers can soften the opinions of voters opposed to same-sex marriage by having a face-to-face talk with them, researchers say.

Gay political canvassers can soften the opinions of voters opposed to  Psychologists have long suspected that direct interaction, like working together, can reduce mutual hostility and prejudice between differing groups, whether blacks and whites or Christians and Muslims. But there is little evidence that the thaw in attitudes is a lasting one. The new study, published Thursday by the journal Science, suggests that a 20-minute conversation about a controversial and personal issue — in this case a gay person talking to voters about same-sex marriage — can induce a change in attitude that not only lasts, but may also help shift the views of others living in the same household. In other words, the change may be contagious. Researchers have published similar findings previously, but nothing quite as rigorous has highlighted the importance of the messenger, as well as the message. “I am very impressed with this paper,” said Todd Rogers, an assistant professor of public policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and a founding director of the Analyst Institute, a voter research group that helps Democratic candidates. Mr. Rogers, who was not involved in the research, said: “There’s a whole infrastructure across the political spectrum devoted to changing people’s attitude and beliefs on important topics, and this has obvious implications. You want a messenger for whom the issue is of personal relevance.” The study, led by Michael LaCour of the University of California, Los Angeles, was a test of whether a door-to-door campaign run by the Los Angeles LGBT Center was having the intended effect. In 2008, after passage of  Mr. LaCour and Donald P. Green, a professor of political science at Columbia, designed an experiment that mimicked a drug trial. They recruited 972 voters from these precincts, broadly surveyed their attitudes — including on same-sex marriage – and then randomly assigned them to receive either the “treatment” or a placebo. The treatment in this case was a knock on the door and a scripted conversation, initiated by either an openly gay canvasser or a straight one. The placebo was either a talk about recycling or no canvassing at all. “Instead of robotically delivering the message, we coached canvassers to be respectful, to listen, to ask questions and dig deeper, and not to judge voters,” said Dave Fleischer, director of the leadership lab at the LGBT Center. The result: Voters canvassed on marriage shifted by about 20 percent in favor of same-sex equality, as measured on a five-point scale of support. Both straight and gay canvassers shifted opinions, but only the opinions of voters canvassed by gays remained as favorable on surveys nine months after initial contact. Voters canvassed on recycling did not budge. “I truly did not expect to see this,” Dr. Green said. “I thought attitudes on issues like this were fundamentally stable over time, but my view has now changed.” The study also found evidence that participants’ changed views affected the thinking of others in the same household. Surveys of those households showed smaller but significant shifts in the same direction, particularly when the issue was in the news, as in 2013, when a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for same-sex marriage in California “What I think is going on is that the Supreme Court decision generated conversation within the household, which had a spillover effect on people living with someone who’d had direct contact with a gay person,” Mr. LaCour said. The study’s authors and the LGBT Center acknowledge that such shifts in attitude on survey scales do not necessarily translate into behavior: that is, votes. People often tell canvassers or pollsters one thing and pull the lever the other way. But Dr. Green said the shifts put people in the study in line with voters’ attitudes in places like Connecticut and Massachusetts, which have supported same-sex marriage laws. At the beginning, their views were aligned with voters in states like Oklahoma and Nebraska, where opposition is strong.
