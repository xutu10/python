Health Researchers Will Get $10.1 Million to Counter Gender Bias in Studies
Grants will be used to include more human participants — generally women — in clinical trials and to ensure that laboratory animals, even cell lines, are representative of both genders.

In an effort to begin addressing persistent gender bias in laboratory research, the National Institutes of Health announced Tuesday that it will distribute $10.1 million in grants to more than 80 scientists studying a diverse array of subjects, including drug addiction, fetal development, migraines and stroke. The researchers will use the additional funds to include more human participants — generally women — in clinical trials and to ensure that their laboratory animals, even cell lines, are representative of both genders. The money also will be used to analyze gender differences in the resulting data, officials said. “It’s an early first step we’re taking to encourage people to see the value of studying sex as a biological variable,” said  Women are not adequately represented in many clinical trials of new drugs and medical devices. The gender bias starts at an early stage of the scientific process: Traditionally many investigators have worked only with male lab animals, concerned that the hormonal cycles of female animals would add variability and skew study results. Scientists often prefer single-sex studies because “it reduces variability, and makes it easier to detect the effect that you’re studying,” said  This year, in a commentary in the journal Nature, Dr. Clayton and Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the N.I.H., called for an end to this bias, and  As a result of the over-reliance on male animals and male cell lines, Dr. Clayton said, “We literally know less about every aspect of female biology compared to male biology.” K. C. Brennan, an assistant professor in neurology at the University of Utah, said he has focused on sex differences in his research on migraines. But including female mice in studies drives up the costs, because his team must do extra experiments to control for the females’ estrus cycles. Yet it’s important to study female animals: Two-thirds of migraine sufferers are women, he noted, and hormonal fluctuations appear to play a role in triggering migraines. Dr. Brennan said he will use the supplemental funds to include female animals in his current research and double the number of experiments. “Sex differences are the elephant in the room,” Dr. Brennan said. “You want to have both male and female animals, because something that shows up differently in males and females might be a clue to how the disease works.” Other researchers will use the grants to evaluate gender differences in stroke, immune responsiveness to vaccines, and molecular differences between the placentas of female and male fetuses, among other topics. Dr. Palmer, of the University of Chicago, already uses both male and female mice in his research on genes that predispose animals to methamphetamine abuse. The supplemental funding will enable him to look at gene expression in 200 animals instead of 100. “We know that the way drug abuse plays out in humans is gender specific,” he said. “If we can understand the mechanisms by which the sex differences might manifest, ultimately we may find different treatments are more effective for one sex or the other.”
