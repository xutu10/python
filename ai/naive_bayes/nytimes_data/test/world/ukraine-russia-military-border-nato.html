Russian Troops Crossing Into Ukraine, NATO Says
The confirmation comes after days of reports from Ukrainian and European officials of tanks crossing into eastern Ukraine in scenes reminiscent of Russia’s invasion of Crimea.

KIEV, Ukraine  — Tanks and other military vehicles towing heavy weapons pouring over the border from  And now, sightings of the “green men,” professional soldiers in green uniforms without insignia, the same type of forces that carried out the invasion of Crimea in the spring. A senior  The assertion drew stern and dismissive denials from Moscow, which for months has denied any military intervention in eastern Ukraine, though it has acknowledged publicly that Russian "volunteers" have crossed into Ukraine to support the separatists. In light of the recent developments, Western officials finally seemed ready to acknowledge that a cease-fire agreement signed in September had fallen apart, and that the threat to peace in Europe had returned in a possibly more virulent form. The official, Gen. Philip Breedlove, the  “Across the last two days we have seen the same thing that O.S.C.E. is reporting,” General Breedlove said at a news conference in Sofia, Bulgaria. “We have seen columns of Russian equipment, primarily Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air defense systems and Russian combat troops entering into Ukraine.” The full scope of the Russian incursion was not clear, he said. “We do not have a good picture at this time of how many,” he said. “We agree that there are multiple columns that we have seen; we agree with the OSCE reports. And as to their intent: I’m not sure.” He added, “It is our first guess that these forces will go in to make this a more contiguous, more whole and capable pocket of land in order to then hold onto it long-term.” Russia forcefully denied that any of its troops or equipment had crossed into eastern Ukraine, and a government spokesman dismissed General Breedlove as unreliable and “alarmist.” “We have stressed repeatedly that there have never been and there are no facts behind the regular blasts of hot air from Brussels regarding the supposed presence of Russian armed forces in Ukraine,” the spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov told Russian news agencies on Wednesday. “We have stopped paying attention to NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe Gen. Philip Breedlove’s unfounded statements alleging that he observed Russian military convoys invading Ukraine.” Sporadic fighting has continued from virtually the moment that the truce agreement was signed on Sept. 5 in Belarus, Minsk by Ukraine and Russia, as well as by representatives of separatist groups in eastern Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which helped broker the deal. Ukrainian officials have complained all along that Russia was taking advantage of the so-called truce to reinforce the rebels in eastern Ukraine with more fighters and equipment. For weeks, however, officials on all sides had insisted that the cease-fire was holding as if force of will alone could perhaps make it so. The weeks of reluctance to acknowledge the fighting underscored the intractability of the conflict and the extraordinary difficulties that have been faced by policy makers looking for a way out of the conflict. For the government of President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, acknowledging the failure of the cease-fire would have meant conceding his inability to exert control in the war zone. For Russia, it would have meant raising the likelihood of additional economic sanctions by Europe and the United States. And for Western officials it would have meant pressure to impose additional sanctions, which are highly unpopular among business interests in their own countries. The cease-fire agreement signed in Minsk had called for monitoring the Russia-Ukraine border by the O.S.C.E. and and had specifically required the removal of “unlawful military formations, military hardware, as well as militants and mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine.” The border, however, has remained porous. And the O.S.C.E. has reported that some unmanned  General Breedlove said the critical point all along has been the lack of border controls. “What worries me the most, as I’ve said before, is that we have a situation now where the former international border, the current international border, of Ukraine and Russia, is completely porous; it is completely wide open. Forces, money, support, supplies, weapons are flowing back and forth across this border completely at will.”
