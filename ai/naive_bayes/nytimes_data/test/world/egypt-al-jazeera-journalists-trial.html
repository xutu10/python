Egyptian Court Orders Retrial for Al Jazeera Journalists
The three television reporters, jailed on charges of aiding the Muslim Brotherhood, will remain in custody while awaiting a new trial.

CAIRO —  But the decision, after a brief hearing Thursday morning, offered no guarantees that the journalists would be freed. Lawyers for the journalists said that the judge had declined requests to suspend their clients’ sentences as they awaited a new trial, thereby extending their imprisonment, which has lasted for more than a year. “I’m disappointed,” said Adel Fahmy, a brother of Mohamed Fahmy, one of the journalists. “We were banking on a retrial with a release. I was expecting something better today.” The journalists — Mr. Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Mohamed —  The defendants were not present at the hearing on Thursday, and reporters were barred from entering the court building until the proceedings had concluded. The case has drawn special notice because two of the journalists are foreigners — Mr. Fahmy is a Canadian citizen and Mr. Greste is Australian. But their ordeal, which the journalists have outlined in letters from prison and in messages sent through family members, has also highlighted the plight of thousands of people swept up by the authorities on charges that are widely viewed as politically motivated. The journalists’ convictions also appeared to be a product of an international feud between Egypt’s government and the rulers of Qatar. Qatar, which owns the Al Jazeera news network, is a strong backer of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that was banned by Egypt’s government after the military ouster of former President Mohamed Morsi in 2013. A recent thaw in relations between the two governments, brokered by Saudi Arabia, had raised hopes that the Egyptian government would finally release the journalists. In December, in a major concession, Qatar suspended broadcasts by an Egyptian affiliate of Al Jazeera that had been sharply critical of Egypt’s government. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt also recently issued a decree allowing the deportation of non-Egyptians convicted of crimes, in a further sign that his government was seeking ways to deal with what had been an embarrassing case. The decree could be good news for Mr. Fahmy and Mr. Greste, but would not help Mr. Mohamed, an Egyptian citizen. Lawyers said on Tuesday that the three journalists could also be granted bail at the start of their new trial, which is expected to begin within a month. In a statement after the court decision on Thursday, Al Jazeera said that the Egyptian authorities had “a simple choice: Free these men quickly, or continue to string this out, all the while continuing this injustice and harming the image of their own country in the eyes of the world. They should choose the former.”
