SEOUL, South Korea — All 109 people on board a South Korean tourist boat were rescued on Tuesday after their vessel ran onto a submerged rock, coast guard officials said. Although the 171-ton ship did not sink and all of its passengers and crew were saved, the accident drew keen attention in South Korea. It was the first notable ferry accident since the 6,825-ton ferry Sewol sank in April, killing 304 people. The two accidents took place about 50 miles apart in waters off the southwestern corner of South Korea. The coast guard was investigating the cause of the latest accident. Local media reported that the ship was taking sightseers around Hongdo, a scenic island, on Tuesday when it ran aground near a coastal bluff of the island. Another tourist ship and fishing boats rushed to the scene to remove the 104 passengers and five crew members from the troubled ship.
