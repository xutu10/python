SYDNEY, Australia —  The hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has resumed in a desolate stretch of the Indian Ocean, more than six months after the jet disappeared with 239 people aboard. The GO Phoenix, one of three ships that are expected to spend up to a year hunting for the wreckage, arrived in the search area about 1,100 miles west of  The search had been suspended for four months so crews could map the seabed in the area. Investigators analyzed transmissions between the plane, a Boeing 777-200, and a satellite to narrow the zone down to a 23,000-square-mile patch of ocean. Flight 370 vanished March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Investigators say it veered sharply off course, going south across the Indian Ocean, controlled for hours by autopilot.
