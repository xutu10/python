NEW DELHI —  Police in Bangalore,  The authorities had been on the hunt for the man, Mehdi Masroor Biswas, since Channel 4 news in Britain broke the improbable story of a clean-shaven Indian executive who it said lived a double life: spending his hours off from his food company far from any Middle Eastern battlefield cheering on the Islamic States’ advances and trying to rally Muslims from around the world to its jihadi cause. The police said Mr. Biswas, 24, would be charged with multiple offenses, including waging war against Asiatic states. As the police closed in on him, Mr. Biswas gave a panicky interview to an Indian newspaper saying that his comments in interviews with Channel 4 had been misconstrued and that his email had been hacked. In a news conference, the Bangalore police commissioner, M. N. Reddy, said that Mr. Biswas had returned to the original story he had given to Channel 4 in Britain, which had tracked him down. Publicly espousing violent or radical views is a serious offense in India and can be punished with life in prison. The country’s long history of religious violence — including the assassination of the country’s founding father, Mohandas K. Gandhi — has made the authorities particularly sensitive to radical speech. Mr. Biswas, who is from West Bengal near the border with Bangladesh, worked the food company by day but posted complimentary updates on Twitter about the activities of the Islamic State, also known as  “He was particularly close to the English-speaking terrorists of ISIS and became a source of incitement and information for the new recruits trying to join,” Mr. Reddy said. The rise and fall of @ShamiWitness, whose Twitter account has since been deleted, illuminates the role of volunteer sympathizers in the global spread of the Islamic State’s message. The Islamic State has become known not only for its brutal methods of pursuing its goals, but also for its often-sophisticated social media campaign, regularly releasing photo reports, audio messages and professional-quality videos glorifying the group’s activities. But analysts say its message is also magnified by an informal network of supporters who may have no official link to the group. Channel 4 said it had found the man behind the @ShamiWitness account by first finding the name of a former Twitter account he had run, and then using that name to search other social media sites until it found a Facebook page belonging to a man named Mehdi. Asked in a telephone interview by the channel whether he supported the Islamic State’s methods, which have included mass executions of captive soldiers and videotaped beheadings of journalists and aid workers, the channel said Mr. Biswas replied, “Mostly.” He also said that he would like to join the jihadists, but could not. “My family needs me here,” he said. “My parents, they are basically dependent on me.” In interactions with Indian reporters, Mr. Biswas’s father said that his son was being framed.
