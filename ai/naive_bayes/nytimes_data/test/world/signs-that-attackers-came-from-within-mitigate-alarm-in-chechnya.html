Signs That Attackers Came From Within Mitigate Alarm in Chechnya
Local militants have claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 14 policemen and at least one civilian, easing concerns that the Islamic State had been involved.

GROZNY, Russia —  In the midst of a terrorist assault on this city, one of the Islamic militants involved recorded a video explaining his motives that, strangely, left some here breathing a sigh of relief. The brief clip shows a young man claiming that a local radical Islamic group, the Caucasus Emirate, was responsible for the attack and citing local grievances related to head scarves. That allayed concerns among analysts and residents of  Still, no one has ruled out an Islamic State role in Thursday’s assault, in which 11 militants armed with explosives and automatic weapons seized a school and an office complex for media companies and killed 14 policemen and at least one civilian. President  A plot by foreign terrorists would only add to Russia’s mounting list of woes that include Western sanctions and a sputtering economy. The home-brewed terrorism of Chechnya is at least a known quantity. Grozny means “Fearsome” in Russian, but in fact it has been emerging as one of the more stable cities in this region where an independence movement led to two devastating wars with Moscow. Assaults are now rare, though a suicide bomber did kill five policemen in October. As residents ventured onto the streets on Friday, many scoffed at the notion that the attackers were foreigners. For one thing, they spoke Chechen, a diabolically difficult language for outsiders to learn. “The real root of all this is the militants could not agree among themselves to share power,” and so needed to stage a high-profile act, Ruslan Zakriyev, a reporter for a religious affairs newspaper, Zori Islam, whose office was in the building captured by the militants, said in an interview. “The attackers are just the pawns.” “Let’s solve our problems with war, not dialogue,” he said of the Caucasus Emirate’s philosophy. He gingerly made his way past bloodstains and bullet pocks in the incinerated interior of his former office, to retrieve what belongings he could. The video was released during the attack and seemed to provide the clearest evidence of a local motive for the violence. A Chechen-speaking man says “we have spread around the city,” and boasts of killing police officers. He says he is acting on behalf of a local militant leader, Aslan Byutukayev, known as Emir Khamzat. “It is an act of retaliation for oppression of Muslim women, our sisters, by Russia’s minions.” That remark was taken to refer to reported threats by the Chechen government that male police officers would touch fundamentalist Sunni women as they arrested them for wearing head scarves that covered their chins as well as their hair. (Mr. Kadyrov has encouraged women to wear scarves that do not touch the chin.) The attackers on Thursday seemed familiar with the city. They infiltrated well-guarded parts of Grozny by calling three taxi cabs from the city to a nearby village, Shalazhi, tied up the drivers, then drove through checkpoints in the taxis. They wore uniforms of traffic policemen. The first shootout occurred near the city center about 1 a.m. Thursday. After that, the militants holed up in the media building and a school until the last of them were killed, around noon. The government has not released the identities, or nationalities, of most of the attackers, but did say that at least one was Chechen. Ibragim Arsanov, a school director and native of Shalazhi, said the attackers were certainly local, but did not have much support among their own people. “The social base of the fighters is minimal,” he said, adding that separatist yearnings have faded as money has flowed from Moscow for reconstruction projects. Still, Aleksei Malashenko, a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in a blog post for Echo of Moscow radio that it was still too early to exclude a role for the Islamic State. At the least, he wrote, the group “inspired” the Caucasus Emirate to make a high-profile attack. Caucasian Knot, a news portal
