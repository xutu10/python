DUBLIN — A former senior  Bobby Storey, 58, a prominent figure in the Irish nationalist political party Sinn Fein and a close confidant of its leader, Gerry Adams, was being questioned by the Police Service of Northern Ireland’s serious-crime office in Antrim, about 40 miles from Belfast, the provincial capital. Mr. Adams was interrogated for four days in May at the same police station concerning the same case. The police announced the arrest on Thursday but did not give Mr. Storey’s name. Gerry Kelly, a Sinn Fein representative and longtime associate of Mr. Storey, confirmed that it was him in a BBC radio interview. The police are investigating the murder and secret burial of Jean McConville, a widowed Belfast mother of 10, which many consider to be among the most tragic episodes in the three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland, which cost more than 3,500 lives. Ms. McConville’s children have given graphic accounts of the day their mother was dragged away by a group of as many as 12 I.R.A. members, some of whom they say they knew. The I.R.A. members suspected that she was an informer for the British Army. She was killed and her body was buried on a secluded beach across the border in the Republic of Ireland; her remains were not discovered until 2003. Mr. Adams has consistently denied any involvement in the abduction and murder of Ms. McConville, which  Mr. Storey acknowledges having been a member of the organizaion, and he is widely believed to have been its head of intelligence before it formally disbanded in 2005. He spent a total of 20 years in jail, most of the time awaiting trial on various charges. He is regarded in republican circles as something of a master spy. He is credited with playing a crucial role in one of the biggest prison breaks in British penal history, the 1983 escape of 38 I.R.A.-linked inmates from the Maze, a maximum-security prison near Belfast. More recently, Mr. Storey was questioned about the theft in 2002 of security files from the Castlereagh police station, the headquarters for government intelligence-gathering in Northern Ireland, and about the 2004 robbery of the Northern Bank, which netted the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars. Sinn Fein and the I.R.A. both denied any involvement in either incident.
