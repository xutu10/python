An Inconvenient Protest for Both China and U.S.
Demonstrations in Hong Kong put the Obama administration in the awkward position of wanting to support pro-democracy forces without alienating a key partner.

WASHINGTON —   A major caveat, of course, is that the fervent crowds in Hong Kong could be long gone by Nov. 10, when Mr. Obama and 20 Pacific Rim leaders gather in Beijing for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. That would certainly be a relief to the Chinese host, President  Human rights have not been a major topic of discussion between the two countries since the aftermath of China’s bloody crackdown in Tiananmen Square 25 years ago. With Washington eager to work with Beijing on a list of priorities — from climate change to curbing  “We have principles and values that we want to promote, but we’re not looking to inject the United States into the middle of this,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The White House is not reconsidering Mr. Obama’s visit, the official said, though it has been calibrating how best to signal its concern for the umbrella-wielding protesters in Hong Kong, especially after the police began roughing up the crowd on Sunday. The United States knows that it has little leverage over China in the dispute over a proposed voting law in Hong Kong, which the Chinese government regards as a strictly internal matter. Chinese officials, including the foreign minister who visited Washington this week, have told their American counterparts, politely, to mind their own business. The tensions in the American position are evident in how it responded to the clashes on Sunday, when the police used tear gas and pepper spray on the protesters. The American consulate in Hong Kong issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint and making no reference to the desire of the crowds for more democracy. “We do not take sides in the discussion of Hong Kong’s political development,” the statement said, “nor do we support any particular individuals or groups involved in it.” Worried that the United States looked as if it were bending over backward to avoid offense, the White House sent out the press secretary, Josh Earnest, to urge the Hong Kong authorities to show restraint and declare that the United States supported “a genuine choice of candidates that are representative of the people’s and the voters’ will.” Asked whether the White House would like to see Hong Kong’s democratic aspirations transplanted to the Chinese mainland, Mr. Earnest said, “the short answer to that is yes.” That response is sure to enrage Chinese officials, who view the Hong Kong protests as deeply threatening because they fear they could spread to other parts of the country. Some Chinese officials blame the United States for the unrest, saying it is whipping up the students. That may have influenced the consulate’s initial fence-sitting. “The consulate statement was maladroit and unbalanced,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, Mr. Obama’s senior director on China until 2011. “They had an understandable impulse, however, to say something that dismissed Chinese concerns that they are the black hand behind the protests.” Human-rights activists said they were generally satisfied with the White House’s response, particularly, said Sophie Richardson, the China director of Human Rights Watch, because it linked the lack of democracy in Hong Kong with the lack of democracy in China. But other experts said the White House should have spoken out sooner, after China’s Parliament proposed the new voting law, which would require candidates for Hong Kong chief executive to be cleared by a nominating committee — effectively ruling out anyone the Chinese government deemed unacceptable. Critics also note that the United States has said little about Mr. Xi’s broader crackdown on civil liberties. “China right now is undergoing the harshest political repression it has seen since 1989,” said David Shambaugh, director of the China policy program at George Washington University, citing the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre. “The situation has gone from bad to worse from Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping, and the administration isn’t speaking out about that.” There is no shortage of friction in the Chinese-American relationship, from China’s aggressive treatment of its neighbors in the East and South China Seas to accusations of Chinese military hacking of American companies. And tensions could flare over climate-change policy. Mr. Obama also needs to keep China in the fold to seal a nuclear deal with Iran. Even if the protests subside, some China analysts said there was a good chance the demonstrators would seize the occasion of the summit meeting in Beijing to re-emerge with their grievances. With so many sensitive items on the agenda, Chinese and American officials are both laboring to prevent Hong Kong from hijacking Mr. Obama’s visit. When China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, met with the United States national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, on Wednesday, the president dropped in to “underscore his commitment to building a stable and constructive U.S.-China relationship,” the White House said in a statement. Mr. Obama raised the issue of Hong Kong, but the statement made it clear that he did so only after a long list of other issues, including the  In a meeting with Mr. Wang at the State Department, Secretary of State John Kerry also mentioned Hong Kong, expressing “high hopes that the Hong Kong authorities will exercise restraint and respect for the protesters’ right to express their views peacefully.” Mr. Wang, however, left no doubt that China did not welcome the scrutiny. “Hong Kong affairs are China’s internal affairs,” he said, using time-tested language. “For any country, for any society, no one will allow those illegal acts that violate public order,” he said. “That’s the situation in the United States, and that’s the same situation in Hong Kong.”
