BASEL, Switzerland — Secretary of State  Mr. Kerry’s remarks were among the sharpest he has delivered on the crisis and were made shortly before he met here with Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister. “Regrettably, Russia continues to supply new weapons and increase support for armed separatists,” Mr. Kerry said in Basel at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has sent teams to Ukraine to monitor a shaky cease-fire. “In doing so, it fails to meet its international and O.S.C.E. obligations and to live up to an agreement that it actually negotiated and signed.” He added, “The result is damage to its credibility, and its own citizens wind up paying a steep economic and human price, including the price of hundreds of Russian soldiers who fight and die in a country where they had and have no right to be.” Russia has steadfastly refused to acknowledge that it has ordered its own forces into Ukraine or that its military has suffered significant casualties there. Mr. Kerry’s comments appear to be a calculated effort to highlight this allegation.

Mr. Kerry also met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Pavlo Klimkin. “We’re still working on a real sustainable cease-fire,” Mr. Klimkin said. “And now it’s about Russia, to deliver.” Mr. Kerry said, “His answer stands.”
