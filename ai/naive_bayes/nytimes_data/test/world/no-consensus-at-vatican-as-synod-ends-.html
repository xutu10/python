No Consensus at Vatican as Synod Ends 
A closely watched Vatican assembly on the family ended without consensus among the bishops in attendance on what to say about gays, and whether to give communion to divorced and remarried Catholics.

A closely watched  The bishops’ final report watered down the warm and welcoming language about gays and divorced couples that appeared in a preliminary report released on Monday, midway through the two-week assembly. Conservative bishops had expressed alarm that the Roman Catholic Church was sending a mixed message on marriage and homosexuality. Pope Francis The assembly is far from the final word, and has served only to open up the debate among prelates and in the wider church, as Francis said he had intended. The bishops are taking the unusual step of publishing the final report showing the vote tallies on each passage, in the interest of transparency, said the Rev. Thomas Rosica, the English-language spokesman at the Vatican meeting. The entire document received approval from a majority of the bishops, but a vote of two-thirds is required to be considered the consensus of the assembly. The passages on gays and divorce did not receive two-thirds of the vote by the 183 bishops in attendance on Saturday, but were not “completely rejected,” Father Rosica said. “It shows that it’s a work in progress,” he said. “We still have a ways to go.” The  “Like Christ with the adulteress, his response is to welcome her, but then he tells her not to sin again,” Cardinal Ravasi said. Cardinal Oswald Gracias said he had met several gays in his archdiocese in Mumbai, India. “They ask whether they can be part of the church, and I say: ‘Yes, yes certainly. Because you are part of the church we care for you,’ ” he said. Upon opening the assembly, known as a synod, Francis urged the bishops to hold a genuinely freewheeling discussion without fear of censure. “Speak clearly,” Francis told the 191 bishops gathered. “No one must say, ‘This can’t be said.’ ” He apparently got what he was asking for. The synod, while clarifying points of consensus, nevertheless brought to the surface clear fault lines between the prelates. They discussed how the church should respond when even active Catholics disregard its teachings, seeing the church as out of touch with modern life. Some bishops took the position that the church must double down on doctrine by articulating more clearly the reasons for its teachings on marriage, and its disapproval of birth control, divorce, homosexuality and cohabitation. Doctrine, they say, is unchanging. “We’re not giving in to the secular agenda,” Cardinal George Pell, the archbishop of Sydney, Australia,  But other bishops said the church should stress inclusiveness, understanding and mercy. Doctrine should be responsive to new developments and information, they said. Asked at a news conference on Friday whether church teaching can change, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, chairman of the German bishops’ conference, said: “Obviously it can change. The history of the church is 2,000 years old.” “Doctrine doesn’t change, but it is understood in a deeper manner,” he added. The preliminary report, written by a committee appointed by Francis, stressed a warm, pastoral approach to the divorced and to cohabiting couples, gay couples and their children. To the surprise of many Catholics, it said some gay relationships provide “precious support in the life of the partners.” There was no mention of the teaching, included in the church’s catechism, that gay relationships are “intrinsically disordered.” Cardinal Wilfrid Napier of Durban, South Africa, was among several bishops who immediately expressed their dismay over the report’s contents. He said the passages that were picked up by the news media reflected what only a few bishops had said in the synod, not what the whole body believed. “The message has gone out, and it’s not a true message,” he said. Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, an American who has emerged as the synod’s standard-bearer for orthodoxy, called on Francis to issue a statement making it clear that the church was not changing its doctrine, saying such a statement was long overdue. Francis soon added Cardinal Napier to the committee to draft the final synod report. Ten committees of bishops suggested extensive changes. By the end of the week, Cardinal Napier said he was content with the results. But Cardinal Burke said  The process reminded some church observers of the debates that took place during the Second Vatican Council, the landmark series of meetings in the early 1960s that changed the church’s worship practices, the role of lay people and relations with other faiths. The Rev. John W. O’Malley, a historian at Georgetown University and the author of “What Happened at Vatican II,” said, “In Vatican II also, the conservatives felt that the church was going to hell in a handbasket with the direction it was taking, and they did everything to stop it.” But he said that in those days, bishops did not go public with denunciations of one another, or make demands of the pope. “We’re in different times,” he said.
