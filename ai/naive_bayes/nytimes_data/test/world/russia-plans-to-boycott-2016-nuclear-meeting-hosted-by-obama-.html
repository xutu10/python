WASHINGTON —  The meeting, to be held in Washington in 2016, was meant to cap eight years of efforts by Mr. Obama to lock down nuclear material around the world before he leaves office. But without Russia, the only nation whose nuclear capacity rivals that of the United States, advocates fear the effort will lose much of its meaning. The Russian decision to skip the meeting came as the two countries have cut off a variety of ties and exchanged sanctions over the clash in  Trade talks, military exchanges and some interactions between space programs have been curtailed, and the United States orchestrated Russia’s suspension from the Group of 8 major powers. Even before the Ukraine conflict erupted, Mr. Obama canceled a visit to Moscow to protest Russia’s decision to harbor Edward J. Snowden, the national security contractor who leaked information about secret surveillance. American and European officials have accused Russia of not living up to a recent agreement made in Minsk, Belarus, to defuse the bloody crisis in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have battled government forces.

Russian officials have accused the United States of helping to orchestrate a coup in Ukraine.

After the third, held in The Hague this year, Mr. Obama said the effort had resulted in 12 countries and two dozen nuclear facilities’ ridding themselves of highly enriched uranium and plutonium as well as dozens of nations’ boosting security at nuclear storage sites, building counter-smuggling teams or creating new centers to improve security. But Russian officials said the effort was duplicative of existing world organizations like the International Atomic Energy Agency, which should be strengthened instead. “We do not see added value coming out of these meetings,” Sergei I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, told reporters Wednesday. Mr. Kislyak said Russia also objected to the way the meeting was being organized, with the United States trying to dominate the proceedings. But he said Moscow still shared the goal of securing nuclear material. “We’re not planning to attend the summit, but not because we are less committed to nonproliferation,” he said. He pointed out that Russia still worked collaboratively with the United States in the negotiations to persuade Iran to limit its  “We haven’t seen any change in the level of cooperation on this,” he said.
