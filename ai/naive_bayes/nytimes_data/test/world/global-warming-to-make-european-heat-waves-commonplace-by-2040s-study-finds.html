Global Warming to Make European Heat Waves ‘Commonplace’ by 2040s, Study Finds
The findings suggest that once every five years, Europe is likely to experience “a very hot summer,” up from a probability a decade ago that such events would occur once every 52 years.

PARIS — ​In June 2003, a high-pressure weather system took hold over Western Europe and hovered there for weeks, bringing warm tropical air to the region and making that summer  Temperatures were about 2.3 degrees Celsius, or 4.1 degrees Fahrenheit, above average that summer, contributing to perhaps 70,000  Now, three scientists from the Met Office, the British weather agency, have concluded that human-caused  Their findings,  To predict how global warming will play out in Europe in the years ahead, Nikolaos Christidis and two of his Met Office colleagues first looked back with a statistical tool called optimal fingerprinting. Their method, in which they entered observed data into complex mathematical models, allowed them to assign responsibility for weather events to natural or human-made factors, an approach that scientists call “climate attribution.” Dr. Christidis and his colleagues, Gareth S. Jones and Peter A. Stott, studied historical data for an area encompassing most of Western Europe and the Mediterranean. They found a striking rise in the probability of extreme summer temperature events over just two decades, 1990-99 and 2003-12. The study also found that the probability of a temperature increase of the magnitude experienced in the 2003 heat wave — 2.3 degrees Celsius above the baseline period average — has gone from less than one every 1,000 years to about one every 127 years. That is because average temperatures have increased over the last two decades and are expected to keep rising. “In the space of one decade, the frequency of these kinds of events changed quite a lot,” Dr. Christidis said in a telephone interview. European summer temperatures “have increased a lot over the last 10 or 15 years,” he said. “And as the climate becomes warmer, you have more of a chance of exceeding these temperature thresholds.” Dr. Christidis said the vulnerability of European citizens became evident during the 2003 heat wave, but he added that scientists should only report their findings, not suggest policies for adaptation. He said it was impossible to estimate what the human toll from future heat waves would be, “as this very much depends on changes that people may make to better adapt.” Michael Oppenheimer, the Albert G. Milbank professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, who was not involved in the study, said the researchers’ conclusions appeared to be plausible, as “events of extreme heat, which were previously highly unlikely to occur, have become much more likely,” even if such events are unlikely in any given year. If carbon emissions, the main human contributor to climate change, continue to rise, he added, events that are currently rare will “become the norm by 2100.” Dr. Oppenheimer said the specific numbers produced by the study needed “to be interpreted with caution,” because of the complexity involved in modeling the atmosphere and ensuring that the data accurately reflect what is happening in the real world. “Nevertheless, this paper probably represents the best that can be done right now,” he said.
