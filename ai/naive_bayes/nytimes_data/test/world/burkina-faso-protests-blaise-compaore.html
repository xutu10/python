LONDON — The authorities sought to contain demonstrations in Ouagadougou, the capital of  Three motionless bodies were seen in the street near the home of Mr. Compaoré’s brother, Reuters reported, after troops there fired live rounds and used tear gas as a crowd approached. Other reports said offices at the National Assembly building had been set on fire and that one person had died. Mr. Compaoré came to power in 1987 in a coup, one of several times the government has been overthrown in Burkina Faso, formerly called Upper Volta, gained independence from France in 1960. He subsequently won several presidential elections, the most recent in November 2010. The country has achieved a measure of stability in recent years. But its citizens have grown increasingly restive as the president’s allies have tried to persuade Parliament to scrap a constitutional limit on presidential terms, so that Mr. Compaoré could run for another term in elections next year. The protests could have a wide influence in other African countries whose leaders are considering measures that would extend their time in office. News agencies quoted the communications minister, Alain Édouard Traoré, as saying the government had abandoned, or at least postponed, the plan to extend Mr. Compaoré’s presidency. But that did not immediately appear to calm crowds seeking emblems of Mr. Compaoré’s rule as targets for their wrath. As the rampage began on Thursday, protesters crossed police lines and broke into Parliament to try to prevent lawmakers from attending a session to approve the constitutional change. Black smoke was seen rising from the building, according to news reports. Hundreds of protesters broke into the state television headquarters, looting equipment and smashing cars, Agence France-Presse reported. Thursday was the third consecutive day of protests in the capital.
