Father Yakunin challenged the Soviet government for its restrictions on religious liberty and accused the hierarchy of his own church of collaborating with the K.G.B.

The Rev. Gleb Yakunin, a priest who fought the Soviet government for restricting religious rights, attacked the leaders of his  The cause was complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, his daughter Maria said. In 1965 Father Yakunin and another priest,  “With each passing day the awareness of the intolerability of further subjection to lawlessness intensifies,” read one passage in the 40-page letter. “With each day grows the salutary thirst in the Russian church for cleansing from that abomination that has accumulated due to the fault of the church authorities; with each day the thirst deepens in the church for authentic conciliar communion.” The letter was also sent to Soviet government officials, including Alexei N. Kosygin, the premier. In 1966, the two priests were barred by the church from serving as priests until they repented. Although some bishops agreed with the substance of the letter, Father Yakunin’s appeal was seen as violating Orthodox practice. Gleb Pavlovich Yakunin was born in Moscow on March 4, 1934. His father was a musician, and Father Yakunin studied clarinet. In the 1950s, he studied biology in Irkutsk, where he became religious, and he was ordained in 1962. Father Yakunin was a co-founder of the Christian Committee for the Defense of the Rights of Believers in the U.S.S.R., created in 1976 to document the persecution of religious believers. This led to his arrest in 1979 and a five-year prison term on charges of anti-Soviet activities, which he served at the Lefortovo Prison in Moscow and then in Perm, followed by exile in the Yakutsk region, near the Arctic Circle. In 1987, after his release under an amnesty by the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, he was restored to the priesthood, but his political activity led to a new conflict with the church hierarchy. Father Yakunin was among the activists who helped re-establish the Moscow Helsinki Group in 1989. He served as a member of Parliament, first in the Supreme Soviet of Russia and later in the State Duma, from 1990 until 1995. After the fall of the Soviet Union, he co-wrote legislation protecting religious freedom and helped enable the reopening of places of worship. After the Soviet Union collapsed, he gained access to K.G.B. archives as a member of a parliamentary committee investigating the August 1991 coup against Mr. Gorbachev. Father Yakunin angered the church by publishing materials that he claimed proved that Patriarch Alexy II, who was elected in 1990, and other senior bishops, were K.G.B. agents. When asked, he acknowledged that other religious bodies in the Soviet Union were also co-opted by the K.G.B. In 1993, he was defrocked by the church for refusing to leave politics. Nonetheless, he won a seat in the first post-Soviet legislature, the Duma. He was excommunicated in 1997 for “anti-church activities.” Father Yakunin was also condemned for associating with a breakaway Ukrainian church, the Kiev Patriarchate, and then for creating another breakaway church, the Apostolic Orthodox Church. In 2012, he spoke out in defense of Pussy Riot, the female punk collective jailed for offending religious believers after offering a “punk prayer” against President Vladimir V. Putin at Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow. Besides his daughter Maria, Father Yakunin is survived by his wife, Iraida; another daughter, Anna; a son, Alexander; and six grandchildren.
