ATHENS — Mounting its biggest and riskiest sea rescue in years, the Greek Navy towed a disabled freighter with hundreds of migrants aboard toward the Aegean island of Crete on Wednesday, fighting strong winds and high seas, officials said. The 250-foot-long ship, the Baris, sent a distress signal on Tuesday when its engine broke down, according to a spokeswoman for the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity under government rules. She said 500 to 700 people were believed to be on the ship, which is usually used to carry general cargo. “This is not a simple operation,” the spokeswoman said. “It is the first time such a large vessel with so many people aboard has run into problems in Greek waters.” Hundreds of migrants a week, many of them from war-ravaged countries like Syria and Afghanistan, try by land or sea to slip illegally into  Little specific information was immediately available about the people on the Baris, which is registered in the Pacific island nation of Kiribati but is managed by a Turkish company, according to the  A Greek Navy frigate took the Baris in tow on Tuesday afternoon and began heading for Ierapetra in southeastern Crete, where the two vessels were expected to arrive in the early hours of Thursday. Aid workers and local officials in Ierapetra were scrambling to collect blankets, mattresses and food for the migrants, who will initially be taken to a basketball arena in the city. “We are doing what we can to prepare for this, but we really don’t know what to expect,” said an official of the Ierapetra port authority, who said he was not authorized to speak publicly. “They have to be checked, registered, and then we can move them to temporary accommodation.” Concerns have been mounting in Europe over the perilous illegal sea crossings attempted by many thousands of migrants, and the strained ability of countries like Greece and Italy to cope with them. The Italian Coast Guard rescued more than 600 migrants last week from the waters between North Africa and Sicily. Nearly 300 Syrian refugees were saved over the weekend from a ship whose engine failed near Cyprus. Amnesty International says that more than 2,500 migrants have died this year trying to cross the Mediterranean. Pope Francis  Greek officials have appealed to the union for more help in dealing with a relentless influx of migrants and refugees seeking a better life in Europe. The country’s merchant marine minister, Miltiades Varvitsiotis, said in October that the number of immigrants trying to enter Greece by sea was expected to triple this year, to more than 30,000. Mr. Varvitsiotis said that most of the new arrivals lately have been coming from Syria and Iraq, in flight from the extremist Islamic insurgencies there.
