Work-for-Welfare Gains a Foothold in Hungary
Under the right-wing rule of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the unemployed in Halmaj — a poor, rural village of 1,800 — must work to get more public assistance.

HALMAJ, Hungary —  The big sow nearest the barn door looked especially frisky this chilly morning. About the size of a Dumpster, and nearly as fragrant, she poked her speckled snout through the bars of her pen and snorted happily as Baba Jeno, 27, stroked her bristled head. “Everything is looking good,” said Jozef Toth, making a late morning inspection. Mr. Jeno nodded, cap in hand. Mr. Toth is the boss here, as he is in pretty much every functioning facility in the village, from the pasta factory to the produce stand to the flat fields of vegetables and the nearby horse corrals. He is also the mayor. Mr. Jeno, laid off from his job assembling BlackBerry devices at a now defunct factory, is glad to have the work, even if he is required to do it to qualify for public assistance. “Everybody knows you can’t get money if you don’t work,” he said. Under a program instituted by the right-wing government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the unemployed must take jobs in “communal work programs” to get more than the bare minimum in public assistance. Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians have been given work in the program, including Mr. Jeno. If all of this sounds a little, well, generous for a leader accused of authoritarian leanings, Mr. Orban’s supporters say that just shows a misunderstanding of the different way that former Communist countries like Hungary develop. “There are between 300,000 and 500,000 people who are able to work, but their socialization to work is very weak,” said Lajos Kosa, the executive vice president of Mr. Orban’s governing Fidesz party. “They need to be led back to the world of employment, but they are lacking fundamental skills.” Those fundamental skills include showing up for work on time or finishing an assigned task, he said. Halmaj, with its 1,800 residents, is a small grid of streets lined with one-story homes with peaked, red-tile roofs beside the narrow trickle of the Barsonyos River. It lies just out of sight of the main highway connecting dour, industrial Miskolc, Hungary’s third-largest city, with the nearby Slovak border. Passing motorists hardly know it is there. Yet in many ways, Halmaj is representative of the forces at work in the poor, rural parts of Hungary under Mr. Orban’s tenure. There is the struggling economy, the endemic unemployment that the government combats with public works projects, and the desire to assimilate poor villagers into a life of working for a paycheck. But not least, there is also the yearning for a Hungarian identity in a country where many residents feel it is under threat from immigrants, emigration and a creeping, Pan-European lifestyle that softens the edges of their national identity. Mr. Orban has made this nationalistic yearning the cornerstone of his appeal. “We are losing touch with our past, we are losing touch with everything,” complained Mr. Toth, a member of the Fidesz party. “But now, I think, people understand that it is important, and they are collecting old family photographs and pieces of the past, before it disappears.” He walked over and ran his hands along the ornate, wooden fence surrounding an old churchyard, freshly built by city workers using a traditional design. “A country that loses touch with its past has lost its soul,” Mr. Toth said. To receive more than the bare minimum of public assistance, about $90 a month, residents must take one of these communal jobs. If they do, they can make anywhere from $180 to $285 per month, depending on the skill level of their job and the number of children they have at home. At the moment, Mr. Toth is employing 140 to 150 people — a few are unreliable on showing up every day — and they work on seven projects. One crew digs ditches, cuts weeds and performs other village improvements. Another tends pine trees, chopping the trees for firewood and grinding them to feed a biomass boiler that heats a few of the public buildings. Some tend pigs and chickens, others manage a growing herd of horses. A handful of village women work in a pasta factory, sorting 10 shapes of noodles on a broad butcher block snowy with flour. The largest team cultivates vegetables and grains on 110 surrounding acres owned by the village, food that is used to feed schoolchildren or is sold in a small market by a plump, cheerful woman in a flowered apron — beans, beets, potatoes, cucumber, peppers and celery. A few residents still refuse to take part in the communal work, but not many. Before the program, unemployment in the village was 20 percent, Mr. Toth said. Now, it is 4 percent. “The idea,” Mr. Toth said, “is to create projects that add value to the village, that will become self-sustaining, and to build the self-esteem of the unemployed and to lead them back to work.” The village also passed a law requiring every homeowner to maintain their property, and to cultivate their back gardens rather than letting the weeds take over. If they do not, public assistance is cut off. He proudly displays a glossy book published by the government called “Best Practices in Communal Work.” Halmaj is one of the three dozen towns featured. Critics sometimes compare the system to a form of forced labor. “Public work is not real work,” scoffed Janos Orsos, who volunteers with a religious group to work with Roma. “Public salary is not real salary.” For Mr. Toth, though, the whole program is a pure win-win. “Some of the people welcomed the idea, and it was easy to get them involved,” the mayor said. “Others, who did not like the work ethic, didn’t welcome the idea in the same way.” Eventually, though, they came around, he said. There was no choice, really.
