At Oscar Pistorius Trial, Questions About South African Prisons
Hearings to determine the sentence for the track star provoked a dispute about the ability of South African prisons to accommodate disabled inmates.

LONDON — Urging that  But on the fourth day of televised hearings to determine a sentence, the country’s prison system also seemed to be on trial, as the defense questioned its ability to accommodate disabled people like Mr. Pistorius, a double amputee since infancy. Kim Martin, the cousin of the victim, Reeva Steenkamp, fought back tears and her voice shook as she told Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa in Pretoria that she was “very fearful” of Mr. Pistorius. “I believe Mr. Pistorius has to pay for what he has done,” she said. Last month, Judge Masipa convicted Mr. Pistorius, 27, of culpable homicide — equivalent to manslaughter — in the killing of Ms. Steenkamp, a 29-year-old law graduate and model, on Feb. 14, 2013. But the judge acquitted him of more serious murder charges. The penalty for culpable homicide can range from a fine to 15 years in jail. The defense has urged that Mr. Pistorius be sentenced to house arrest. The athlete has admitted firing shots into a locked toilet cubicle door that killed Ms. Steenkamp, but says he mistakenly believed that an intruder had entered his home. “My family are not people who are seeking revenge,” Ms. Martin testified for the prosecution. “We just feel that to take someone’s life, to shoot somebody behind a door, that is unarmed, that is harmless, needs sufficient punishment. “We need to send a message to society that you cannot get away with this.” Gerrie Nel, the chief prosecutor, also called Zach Modise, the acting head of South Africa’s correctional services, to testify that the country’s prisons — depicted by the defense as overcrowded, harsh and unhealthy environments dominated by criminal gangs — were equipped for the disabled, offering single-cell accommodation, vocational training, health care, sports facilities and gyms. Mr. Modise acknowledged that there were gangs “trying to take over” prisons but said correctional officers had developed a strategy to try to curb their power. Under cross-examination by the defense lawyer, Barry Roux, Mr. Modise said a hospital wing would provide the most suitable accommodation in prison for a disabled person. Asked to provide statistics for Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria, Mr. Modise said it had 7,000 inmates, one doctor and five psychologists. He declined to guarantee that Mr. Pistorius would be housed in a hospital wing if sentenced to a prison term. “There’s nothing that’s taken for granted on admission,” he said.
