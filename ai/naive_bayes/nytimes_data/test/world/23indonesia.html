Defamation Law Said to Recall Indonesia’s Authoritarian Past
Recent cases have rekindled a debate about a law that can send to prison those who speak ill of Indonesia electronically, as activists call for an end to legislation they consider a blemish on Indonesia’s transition to a robust democracy.

JAKARTA, Indonesia —  When an Indonesian law student posted an online rant saying the historic city of Yogyakarta in Central Java was “poor, stupid and uncultured,” she earned more than the ire of its residents. She ended up in a police detention cell, charged with cyberdefamation. The episode was one of four recent defamation cases that have rekindled a national debate about a 2008 electronic information law under which offenders can be imprisoned for up to six years. Rights activists, the news media and much of the public consider the law a blemish on Indonesia’s mostly successful transition from an authoritarian state to  The other cases, which drew national attention and much scorn in the news media, raised similar questions about the limits on online speech in Indonesia, which has among the most Facebook and Twitter users in the world. A day before the law student’s arrest, a noted criminologist was forced to issue a public apology when the national police chief threatened to investigate him for criminal defamation for stating — accurately, according to anticorruption groups — during a television interview that the police department’s general crimes division was rife with corruption. In a case this month, the East Java Province branch of a hard-line Muslim group, the Islamic Defenders Front, filed a police complaint against students from a local Islamic university for “defaming God.” The students had organized a freshman orientation program titled “God Is Rotting: Reconstruction of Fundamentalism to Create a Cosmopolitan Islam.” The group demanded that the students be executed. Most recently, the mayor of the West Java city of Bandung, Ridwan Kamil, reported a local Twitter user to the police, citing cyberdefamation for making offensive remarks about him online, including a joke about his sexual orientation. The four cases have produced only one arrest so far and no convictions. The law student, Florence Sihombing, 26, was released and issued a public apology, but remains under investigation. The 2008 Law on Information and Electronic Transactions provides for prison time for anyone convicted of using electronic media — including Internet news portals, social media networks and television — “to intimidate or defame others.” Article 27 of the law says insulting the “dignity of someone” is a criminal offense. And while there have been fewer than 20 criminal prosecutions under the law, that has not stopped people from going to jail. Under Indonesian law, in cases of crimes punishable by six years or more in prison, the police have the authority to detain suspects. “I don’t know why this would happen in Indonesia in 2014,” said Agustinus Pohan, a legal expert at Parahyangan Catholic University in Bandung, the capital of West Java Province. “We’ve come so far in developing our democracy.” In Ms. Sihombing’s case, he said, the police wrongly interpreted “dignity of someone” to apply to an entire city. Still, there have been convictions. In February, a court in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, sentenced a popular Indonesian blogger to one year of probation for implying on Twitter that a lawmaker who had been caught up in a banking scandal had engaged in corruption. In 2012, a court in West Sumatra Province  The most famous case occurred in 2009 when Prita Mulyasari was arrested on charges of cyberdefamation after an email she wrote complaining about treatment at a private hospital on the outskirts of Jakarta was posted in an Internet chat group. Television images of the teary-eyed Ms. Prita, a mother of two, in a women’s prison outraged the public and set off an online movement to free her and pay her legal bills. A presidential election campaign was in full swing and all three candidates criticized the law and said it should be reviewed. After the incumbent, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, was re-elected, however, his administration never moved to amend the law. His spokesman, Teuku Faizasyah, said it was up to the Ministry of Communication and Information to review the law and suggest changes. The Indonesian Press Council and other civil society groups have lobbied the ministry to amend the law to remove cyberdefamation as a criminal offense, as well as to eliminate punishment by imprisonment. “This law is more fascist than any kind of defamation law we had during the Dutch colonial period,” said Leo Batubara, an adviser to the Press Council and its former deputy chairman. Gatot S. Dewa Broto, the information ministry’s former spokesman who is now a candidate to become its next minister, said the ministry had planned to review sections of the law this year, including those pertaining to the definition of defamation and the maximum prison sentence. But the plan was delayed, he said, because Indonesia was again in the midst of elections — legislative elections in April and a presidential election in July. The new Parliament will convene on Oct. 1, and the new president, Joko Widodo, the governor of Jakarta, is to be sworn in on Oct. 20. “So we’ll have to wait until both are sitting to review it,” Mr. Gatot said in an interview. “I agree that the definition of defamation tends to be prone to multiple interpretations.” As for Ms. Prita, she was released on bail after the outcry over her case, and the Supreme Court overturned her conviction on appeal in 2012. “I’m clearly not the last victim,” she said, “because others have been arrested and prosecuted, including some of these recent cases. Campaign promises are nothing more than just promises.”
