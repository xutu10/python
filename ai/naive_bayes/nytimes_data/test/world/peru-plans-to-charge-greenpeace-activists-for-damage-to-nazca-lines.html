Peru Plans to Charge Greenpeace Activists for Damage to Nazca Lines
About a dozen people entered a fragile protected area around the archaeological feature, leaving marks on the rocks.

CARACAS, Venezuela —  President Ollanta Humala of  Greenpeace stirred up a storm of controversy in Peru last week after a group of about 12 activists on Monday  Officials said that the activists walking over the fragile desert ground left marks that cannot be removed. The Nazca Lines were created over 1,000 years ago, and include enormous figures of birds, mammals and geometric shapes etched into the earth. Mr. Humala said Greenpeace had “simply come to trample on” the country’s heritage. “We must simply spread the word, alert the world,” Mr. Humala said. “Watch out at the Taj Mahal, watch out at the pyramids in Egypt, because we all face the threat that Greenpeace could attack any of humanity’s historical heritage.” He said that he hoped that prosecutors and the courts would take action against the activists. In a strange twist, a judge on Saturday rejected a request by prosecutors to detain the activists or keep them from leaving the country, saying that prosecutors had failed to provide their addresses. But the request by prosecutors appeared to be too late anyway, since Greenpeace had said a day earlier that the activists had already left Peru. Luis Jaime Castillo, the deputy minister for cultural heritage, said in a telephone interview that the authorities still intended to pursue criminal charges against the activists. He said that he had met with several Greenpeace members in Lima on Thursday. The group included one of the activists who took part in the incident at the Nazca Lines. He identified the activist as Mauro Fernández, who appeared in  Mr. Castillo said that he asked for the names of the other activists who participated in the stunt, and that Mr. Fernández told him that he could not remember their names. That appeared to fly in the face of pledges by Greenpeace to cooperate with the authorities. Mr. Castillo said officials suspected that some members of the group had visited the site on a previous occasion to prepare for the stunt. Greenpeace has issued a statement apologizing for the incident. A Greenpeace spokesman did not respond to emails on Saturday. The ground around the lines consists of white sand topped by a layer of darker rocks. When the activists entered the area they disturbed the top layer, exposing the sand below.
