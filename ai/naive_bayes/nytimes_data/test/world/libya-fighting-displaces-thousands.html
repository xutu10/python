About 100,000 people have fled fighting near the capital, Tripoli, in the past three weeks, adding to a growing problem of internal displacement, the United Nations refugee agency said Friday. “With fighting among rival armed groups intensifying in a number of areas of Libya, we are seeing growing displacement, now estimated at 287,000 people in 29 cities and towns countrywide,” the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement. The main area of recent displacement is around Warshefana, a suburb of Tripoli, and about 15,000 have fled from fighting around the Benina area outside Benghazi, it said. Most displaced people are living with local families but others are sleeping in schools, parks and nonresidential buildings converted into emergency shelters.
