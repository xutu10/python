A man killed eight people, including two young children, in a “senseless mass murder” in Alberta before committing suicide, the Edmonton police chief, Rod Knecht, said Tuesday. The killings occurred in two homes in Edmonton, the province’s capital, and the suicide at an Asian restaurant in nearby Fort Saskatchewan, he said. The police had been called to one of the homes Monday night by relatives of the man, who said he seemed suicidal, but they did not find him there. Early Tuesday they returned to the home, in north Edmonton, and found seven bodies, including those of a boy and a girl, Chief Knecht said at a news conference. No identities were released, and the relationships were not clear, Chief Knecht said, though he called the deaths “tragic incidents of domestic violence.”
