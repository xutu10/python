Scotland Hears Last-Minute Appeals on Independence Vote
The referendum’s potential effect on the economy, on public services and on defense were the subjects of debate in advance of the vote on Thursday.

DUNDEE, Scotland — With Scotland just one day away from voting on independence, a fractious campaign was drawing to a close Wednesday with controversy over its potential effect on the economy, public services and defense amid last-minute appeals from both sides. Opinion polls predict a close result and, whatever the outcome, the vote on Thursday is almost certain to provoke a major change in the relationship between Scotland and the rest of the nation, with the main British parties promising more powers of self-government to Scots even if they reject independence. In a letter to the British tabloid The Sun, 14 former chiefs of the British armed forces urged voters to reject independence, arguing that such an outcome was “critical for all our security” and that breaking up Britain would “weaken us all." First Minister  Mr. Salmond and the leader of the campaign against independence, Alistair Darling, a former chancellor of the Exchequer from the Labour Party, spent the day trying to woo the many undecided voters who are likely to determine the outcome. Mr. Darling condemned demonstrations outside the office of the BBC in Scotland by some supporters of independence who accused it of bias, a charge BBC News rejects. Mr. Darling said some people had found the protests “frightening.” He scheduled a rally later in the day with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a fellow Labourite who has emerged as an important figure in the “no” campaign in recent weeks. Economic issues have been dominant in the campaign, and there have been warnings from some Scottish banks and businesses of a negative impact from a “yes” vote. These have been dismissed as scaremongering by Mr. Salmond and his supporters. The two sides disagree over fundamental issues such as whether an independent Scotland would be able to use the pound as its currency. The three main British political parties have ruled out a currency union, leaving the less palatable option of using the pound in the same way that Panama, for example, uses the dollar. But “yes” campaigners say they are bluffing and will change their tune if the referendum passes. Mr. Salmond has targeted wavering center-left voters, arguing that a vote for independence would protect from privatization the popular National Health Service, which offers free health care to all. The “no” campaign argues that health in Scotland is already controlled by the Scottish Parliament and is therefore protected unless Scots themselves want change. In any event, Mr. Salmond has appealed to many voters by arguing that Scotland could pursue more socially democratic policies if independent, rather than as part of Britain. Scots have tended to tilt to the left of the English in recent years, and the Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, is not popular here. Mr. Salmond described the referendum as one of Western Europe’s “most extraordinary” political campaigns, one that had prompted thousands of people to register to vote for the first time. In an open letter to Scots, he described the independence vote as “the greatest, most empowering moment any of us will ever have.”
