GENEVA —  A senior North Korean envoy said Thursday that his country was ready to resume six-party talks on its nuclear program, but must maintain its readiness in the face of joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. In an interview,  The negotiations over  North Korea promised to abandon its nuclear program in 2005, but it appeared to renege on the agreement when it tested nuclear devices in 2006 and 2009. In light of American and South Korean military exercises, Mr. So said, “We have to be alert; also, we have to be prepared to make countermeasures.” Asked whether North Korea was preparing a nuclear test or to fire a missile, he replied, “No, no.” Mr. So said that denuclearization “is the party’s policy.” Questions about Mr. Kim’s health were prompted by his failure to appear in public for weeks, and then by a video that showed him limping. But Mr. So denied that Mr. Kim had had surgery on his ankles, and asked about the nature of his ailment, Mr. So said, “That is rumors, fabricated rumors.” Mr. So said it was not clear that the United States was willing to negotiate the release of three Americans held by North Korea. “I was told that they asked for the government of America to have negotiations on those problems,” Mr. So said, “but I don’t know whether America is ready or not to release them, or have some understandings or the recognition of those crimes they made.”
