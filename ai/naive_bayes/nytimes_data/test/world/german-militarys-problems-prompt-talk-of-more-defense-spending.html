German Military’s Problems Prompt Talk of More Defense Spending
Germany is trying to increase its involvement in global security after years of reluctance, but its limitations have have drawn questions from politicians.

BERLIN — In a spectacle that a leading weekly likened to a slapstick movie, Germany’s military, especially its air force, has repeatedly stumbled in recent days as it tried to ratchet up its international involvement by delivering personnel and matériel to forces battling Islamic extremists in Iraq and aid supplies to Africa to ease the Ebola crisis. By Monday, when the latest failure of Germany’s limited air capabilities became known, politicians were demanding explanations from Ursula von der Leyen, the country’s defense minister, and pondering aloud the possible revision of what has long been a political no-go: raising the budget for defense spending. Ms. von der Leyen is among German leaders who in recent months have championed a more active role for the country in international crises. One striking example was the decision this month to send arms to Kurdish and Iraqi security forces, which broke a longstanding taboo on Germany‘s dispatching of weapons to a conflict zone. But weaknesses began to emerge last week, when a plane that was taking six German paratroopers to Iraq — to help train Kurdish security forces on nearly $900 million worth of weaponry — ended up stuck in Bulgaria for two days without authorization to enter Iraq. A day after that problem became public, a Dutch plane set to deliver the first weapons from Germany — 50 bazookas, 520 rifles and 20 machine guns — was grounded, prompting a scramble to find alternative transport. That effort drew extra attention to the dozens of military planes and helicopters grounded for repairs or lack of spare parts. On Monday, it emerged that a German military plane involved in transporting aid to West Africa needed to make an emergency landing in the Canary Islands. As the limitations were exposed, the Defense Ministry last week delivered a report on battle readiness to the Defense Committee of Parliament, where committee members contended that ministry officials had misled them about how quickly or well Germany could meet NATO and other commitments. The Defense Ministry has traditionally been in a difficult position in Germany, where most people — reared after the Nazi dictatorship — shy away from the use of military force. For decades, Germany, now the world’s leading exporter and fourth biggest economy, has also been reuniting its east and west and more preoccupied at home than abroad. This year, however, Germans have felt insecurities mounting, particularly over Ukraine and across the Middle East. For the first time in many years, those crises and the state of the armed forces have prompted discussions about defense spending, said Thomas Wiegold, a defense specialist who reports on security. For this year, Germany has a military budget of 32.8 billion euros, about $41.6 billion and 1.3 percent of gross domestic product, far below the NATO target of 2 percent. The United States has long complained that many European countries, notably Germany, have fallen short. Until recently, those complaints were ignored, “but it now seems to be becoming a debate,” Mr. Wiegold said. “I do a lot of radio interviews, particularly in the last week. Now I am being asked whether we should spend more money. That has never happened before.” He and other experts traced many of the current problems to a 2010 reform that encouraged the military to keep as many systems deployed as possible, at the same time that there was reduced ordering of spare parts. That has left the air force, for instance, reliant on Transall transport planes that entered service 50 years ago. The first new transport planes are scheduled to enter service this fall. In addition, Mr. Wiegold noted, Ms. von der Leyen has found promising air transport — for Mali, the Central African Republic or the Ebola crisis — a more politically acceptable contribution to international efforts than, say, sending paratroopers. “It has something to do with the basic political mood in Germany, that if we have to take part internationally, then better a ‘peaceful’ participation,” Mr. Wiegold added. Ms. von der Leyen has also come under criticism from some politicians, who say she is overly eager to publicize Germany’s new missions through photo opportunities – such as those last week in Iraq — instead of tackling her ministry’s problems from her desk in Berlin. But the defense minister, sometimes seen as a rival and possibly a successor to Chancellor Angela Merkel, received robust backing on Monday from Ms. Merkel’s spokesman. “She puts things on the table and gives an overview of things as they are,” said the spokesman, Steffen Seibert. “That is the first step toward solving problems which have built up over years.”
