A senior police investigator survived an assassination attempt on Thursday in Karachi after a bomb blast hit his convoy, police officials said. The investigator, Farooq Awan, a senior superintendent who leads a special investigating unit that tracks terrorists and militants, was wounded, as were seven other people, and a civilian passer-by was killed. Police officials said that according to an initial investigation, a vehicle filled with explosives was detonated by a remote-controlled device as the convoy passed by. Jundullah, a militant group that operates mostly in Karachi, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to local news media reports. Mr. Awan has been involved in the arrests of several high-profile militants, including Omar Saeed Sheikh, who was convicted in the 2002 killing of Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal correspondent.
