Yasukuni Shrine Urged to Remove Names of War Criminals
A chapter of Izokukai, an influential association of families of the war bereaved, backed a proposal to separate war criminals from other war dead at the Japanese shrine.

TOKYO — An influential group representing families of Japanese soldiers killed in  The Fukuoka Prefecture chapter of the War-Bereaved Families Association, or Izokukai, in southern  The resolution comes at a time when the shrine, which honors Japan’s 2.5 million modern war dead, has become a chronic source of friction with China and South Korea, two victims of early 20th-century Japanese militarism that object to visits to Yasukuni by Japanese leaders. Japan’s current prime minister, Shinzo Abe, a vocal nationalist, increased tensions by  The visit was widely seen as a bid to please his supporters on the political right, including the Izokukai, which has been a fervent advocate of visits to Yasukuni to honor the war dead. For this reason, Monday’s resolution raised eyebrows in Japan by signaling a new flexibility in at least one chapter of the national group in the face of geopolitical tensions, though it remains to be seen whether other chapters will follow suit. The resolution is an effort to remove a main source of the controversy surrounding Yasukuni: its honoring of the souls of Class A war criminals, who were convicted by the postwar Tokyo Tribunal of crimes against humanity for starting the war. Seven of them were hanged; the others were imprisoned or died before they could be sentenced. None of the war dead honored at the shrine are buried there; the site just enshrines their souls under the beliefs of Japan’s native Shinto religion. Those 14 were secretly added to the list of souls honored at Yasukuni by the shrine’s priests in 1978, a move that reflected the belief of some Japanese nationalists that the war criminals were actually patriots who were victims of victor’s justice by the triumphant Allies. When the enshrinement was made public a year later, in 1979, the emperor at the time, Hirohito, protested by refusing to visit Yasukuni, a boycott continued by his son, the current emperor, Akihito. The honoring of the 14 has also been the main reason given by China and South Korea for their objections, starting in the 1980s, to Japanese politicians visiting the shrine. In those countries, the presence of the war criminals has helped make Yasukuni a symbol of Japan’s perceived lack of repentance for its wartime misdeeds. Proposals to remove the 14 have been made before, including by prominent members of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan for most of the past six decades. Enshrining them elsewhere would allow Japanese politicians to honor their war dead without seeming to revere the wartime leaders, and their decision to start the war. However, the shrine, which is privately run, has so far resisted such efforts, saying that once a soul has been added to the shrine, it cannot be removed. It has also criticized pressure from politicians as a violation of the Japanese Constitution’s separation of church and state. The bereaved families association has long been seen as generally supportive of the shrine. However, some families have also objected to having their loved ones’ souls enshrined with those of the wartime leaders who sent them to their deaths in a suicidal war. If the 14 are removed, the Fukuoka chapter “hopes that the emperor and empress, as well as the prime minister and all other Japanese nationals, will be able to pay their respects at Yasukuni without reserve,” the resolution said.
