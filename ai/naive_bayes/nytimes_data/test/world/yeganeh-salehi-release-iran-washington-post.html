TEHRAN — The wife of The Washington Post’s Tehran bureau chief was quietly released last week, a family member said Monday, although her husband remains in custody since the two were detained in July. The wife, Yeganeh Salehi, a correspondent for The National, a newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, was not willing to be interviewed, said the family member, who asked not to be identified for security reasons. Mrs. Salehi and her husband, Jason Rezaian,  There have never been any formal charges against Mr. Rezaian, who has Iranian and United States citizenship, or Mrs. Salehi, an Iranian. During his visit to the United Nations in September, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif,  Mrs. Salehi, like her husband, was officially accredited by Iranian authorities to work as a journalist. The Washington Post quoted There have been concerns about Mr. Rezaian’s health because he has high blood pressure and must take medication daily. Neither Mrs. Salehi nor her family in Tehran will be speaking to the news media about the detentions, Ali Rezaian told The Washington Post, and he asked for their privacy to be respected. According to several sources, Mr. Rezaian has not been held at Tehran’s main prison, Evin, but in a private house, which could indicate that he is not detained by regular security forces but by a parallel organization connected to hard-line centers of power in Iran.
