MEXICO CITY —  The governor of the southern Mexico state where  Gov. Ángel Aguirre of the state of Guerrero did not say whether all of the 28 bodies removed by forensic experts had been identified yet. The remains had been severely burned, and experts are conducting DNA tests in an effort to identify the dead. The governor spoke at a news conference in Iguala, the city where the municipal police have been accused of connections with a drug gang that is believed to have been involved in the students’ disappearance on Sept. 26. Vidulfo Rosales, a lawyer representing families of the missing students from a teachers college, said he had no information about identification of any of the remains. He said it was regrettable that the authorities had not informed the families before releasing the information about the bodies. Governor Aguirre made no comment about what the authorities might have found in four other mass graves in the same area as the burial site where the 28 bodies had been unearthed last week. That discovery was revealed Thursday by  Governor Aguirre told reporters on Saturday that no more arrests had been made in the case. The 43 students have been missing since two shooting episodes in which police gunfire killed six people and wounded at least 25 in Iguala. Prosecutors said police officers rounded up some students after the violence and drove off with them. The officers are believed to have turned the students over to a drug gang that is suspected of having ties to the family of Iguala’s mayor, José Luis Abarca, who is a fugitive.
