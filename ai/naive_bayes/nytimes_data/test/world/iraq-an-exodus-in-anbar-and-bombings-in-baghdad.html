Militants with the Islamic State group on Monday captured a military training camp west of the capital near the city of Hit as they inch closer to full control of Anbar Province. The recent fighting around Hit and Ramadi, the provincial capital, has forced as many as 180,000 people from their homes, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Monday. In Baghdad, a spate of bombings on Monday hit mostly Shiite neighborhoods and left at least 30 people dead. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but the Islamic State has claimed several bombings in the city.
