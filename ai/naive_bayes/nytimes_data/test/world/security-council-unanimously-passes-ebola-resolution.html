UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations Security Council, in a highly unusual move, on Thursday declared the Ebola crisis in West Africa to be a threat to international peace and security, unanimously passing a resolution that calls on countries worldwide to urgently send medical personnel and supplies to contain the outbreak. “It’s a call to action not just from the Security Council but from the whole United Nations family,” said Ambassador Samantha Power of the United States, which drafted the resolution. In addition, the United Nations secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, announced a plan to set up an emergency mission to tackle the swiftly spreading disease that has already ravaged the nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea and spread panic and fear. “The gravity and scale of the situation now require a level of international action unprecedented for a health emergency,” Mr. Ban said. The 15-0 vote approving the resolution came as the Obama administration pledged medicine, equipment and 3,000 military personnel to help the countries of the region. The resolution was co-sponsored by 131 countries, Ms. Power said, the most co-sponsors of any Council resolution ever.
