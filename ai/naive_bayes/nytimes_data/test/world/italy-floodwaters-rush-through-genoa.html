Flash floods have inundated the port city of Genoa, with two rivers bursting their banks and sending a torrent of water and mud down some streets. One person was confirmed dead in the overnight storm, officials said Friday. Residents were left without electricity, schools were closed and Italian news reports said a train had derailed because of the conditions. News reports said police divers recovered a body near where the Bisagno River overflowed. The water dumped more than three feet of gray mud in parts of city and surrounding areas and sent parked cars tumbling into one another. The Italian Red Cross said two rivers had overflowed and that some neighborhoods were cut off from rescuers.
