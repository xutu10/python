JERUSALEM — Israeli forces fatally shot a  A spokeswoman for the Israeli military said that troops opened fire at a man who was aiming a homemade gun at them from a crowd of about 200 people throwing stones and Molotov cocktails on the main road leading south from Jerusalem. Witnesses said the man, Mohammed Jawabreh, 21, who lived in Al Arroub refugee camp, just off the road, was shot in the chest and died. The clash near Al Arroub came as the Israeli military added units in the West Bank, and the Israeli police bolstered patrols in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Arab towns to curb the mounting violence. Micky Rosenfeld, an Israeli police spokesman, said the streets were “relatively quiet” at midday Tuesday, though there were a number of flareups. The military spokeswoman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity according to protocol, said troops also used live ammunition to disperse a crowd of 150 people hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails south of Hebron, injuring one Palestinian man. Ma’an, an independent Palestinian news agency, reported that the windows of dozens of cars were smashed in the West Bank town of Hawara. Agence France-Presse said the Israeli police arrested four 13-year-old Jewish Israelis for throwing rocks at an Arab cab driver in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Beit Hanina. Separately, Mr. Rosenfeld said a Palestinian man from the West Bank was killed in the Arab-Israeli town of Zemer, in a confrontation that was criminal, not political. The continuing unrest came as President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority headlined a 10th-anniversary commemoration of the death of his predecessor, Yasir Arafat, and as Israelis buried two victims of Monday’s stabbings. Mr. Abbas, who inherited the leadership of the Fatah faction from Arafat, used his speech to criticize Hamas, the Islamist movement that dominates  “Hamas leaders are behind the bombings in Gaza,” Mr. Abbas said, highlighting the continuing rift between the rival political parties months after the signing of a reconciliation pact in April. “We’re committed to national reconciliation, but Hamas actions do not indicate their desire to complete it.” Expressing solidarity with Gaza residents who lost homes and relatives during this summer’s bloody battle between Hamas and  Hamas leaders lashed back at the criticism, saying the speech would harm Gaza and help Israel by fomenting further division between the factions. “What the Palestinian people need is a courageous president,” Mushir al-Masri, a Hamas spokesman, wrote on his Facebook page. Mr. Abbas also warned of “a devastating religious war” if Jewish Israelis continue to press for permission to pray at what they call the Temple Mount and Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary, a focal point of the current unrest. “The Muslim and Christian world will never accept Israeli claims that Jerusalem is theirs,” he said. “Jerusalem is our capital, and we will never give this up. Jerusalem that was occupied in 1967 is our Jerusalem. We will safeguard and protect our holy places.” Mr. Abbas did not directly address the recent spate of Palestinian violence. But Israel’s defense minister, Moshe Ya’alon, vowed to stop it during a visit to Gush Etzion, the area where the 26-year-old female settler, Dalia Lemkus, was one of three Israelis stabbed on Monday afternoon. “We will take a strong hand, including destroying houses of terrorist to stop this wave,” Mr. Ya’alon said in an appearance broadcast on Israel Radio. “I call from here again on anyone who has any part or influence to calm things down. I understand Hamas does not have an interest in calm, and maybe other Islamic forces don’t. But if the Palestinian Authority has an interest in calming things down, it would be wise to calm things down.” At the Askar refugee camp, on the outskirts of Nablus, relatives of Nur al-Din Khaled Abu Hashieh, the 18-year-old suspected of stabbing Sgt. Almog Shilony, 20, near a crowded Tel Aviv train station, said on Tuesday that they were worried Israeli forces would soon demolish their home. Monday night, they said, Mr. Abu Hashieh’s father and three of his five brothers were detained by the authorities for questioning about the attack. The funeral for Sergeant Shilony, who was posthumously promoted to staff sergeant, was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. Ms. Lemkus was buried in the morning. “He murdered you because you were a Jew living in the land of Israel,” her father, Nahum, said, according to the Israeli news site Ynet, arguing that the West Bank “belongs to us.”
