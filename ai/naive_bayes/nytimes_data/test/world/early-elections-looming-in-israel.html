Early Elections Looming in Israel
Amid acrimony, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition appears to be on the brink of collapse.

JERUSALEM —   A meeting between Mr. Netanyahu of the conservative Likud Party and his finance minister, Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid, a major coalition partner, failed to produce understandings. Instead it ended in acrimony with Yesh Atid declaring in a statement, “Netanyahu is leading Israel to unnecessary elections” and accusing the prime minister of a back-room deal for a new government with ultra-Orthodox parties, his longtime political allies. Mr. Netanyahu, who has berated ministers for undermining him, said earlier on Monday that he may have no choice but to return to the voters. Likud ministers accused Mr. Lapid of deflecting the blame for his economic failures. Mr. Netanyahu is expected to seek a fourth term if new elections are held. He was last elected in January 2013 for what was supposed to be a four-year term. Israeli news media speculated that new elections could be held as early as next March. The political crisis has built up in recent weeks over diplomatic and economic issues and a proposed nationality law. A hard-line version of the nationality legislation was promoted by right-wing lawmakers with Mr. Netanyahu’s backing. Two centrist parties in his coalition, Yesh Atid and Hatnua, denounced it as emphasizing Israel’s Jewish character above its commitment to democracy. And Mr. Netanyahu has come out against Mr. Lapid’s flagship housing reform plan.
