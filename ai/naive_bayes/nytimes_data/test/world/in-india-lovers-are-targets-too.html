India’s Lovers Are Targets, Too
India’s young who display their affections in public infuriate “guardians of culture.”
===
NEW DELHI —  To be in love and to let it show in  As things are, India’s young do not have to display their affections in public to infuriate all sorts of people, especially underemployed political thugs. Across the nation, lovers are hounded in homes, resorts, pubs and cafes, and are accused of indulging in youth. There is now a clear pattern to this: A gang of unhappy men receive information about boys and girls making out in a recreational space that the unhappy men do not usually frequent. They go to the site with cameramen and photographers from news agencies, which are happy to be complicit in what follows. The thugs break objects and assault the couples. In the past, on Valentine’s Day, thugs have forced couples in parks to perform squats as punishment. Couples have also been forcibly married  on the streets. The thugs do this, they say, to guard something widely known in India as Indian culture. It often appears that culture is something only Indians possess, and that the rest of the world is one big orgy. A few days ago, in the southern state of Kerala, a group of men attacked a popular cafe where, they claimed, the young went to kiss and “to hug,” as one of the guardians of culture put it. They accused young people at the cafe of being obscene. It is illegal to be obscene in India, though no one is clear what obscenity is. There is no ambiguity, however, about what constitutes vandalism. Three years ago, when a mass movement against political corruption swept the nation’s middle classes, Kerala was relatively unmoved. This is because its people, including the young, have long been politically engaged, so street revolution had no novelty for them. But the attack on the cafe by thugs roused Kerala’s young, who  erupted in a joyous street protest during which many of them kissed in public — sometimes on the lips, but mostly less provocative  places on the face. They called their movement Kiss of Love. Burly men approached them and asked, “What is it that you want?” What they wanted was the right to display their affections without being assaulted by burly men. Even though there are hundreds of political parties in India representing narrow segments of society, political representation for lovers is considered amusingly frivolous, even though they number in the millions and face  serious problems from a hostile society. The notion has crossed some minds, however. A few years ago, a man founded the Indian Lovers Party with the goal of serving honorable lovers, which excluded those in illicit relationships. But the idea did not fly. The Kiss of Love campaign quickly attracted hundreds of supporters in the physical world and thousands on Facebook. The police arrested some of  them. Thugs attacked them. The thugs also, inadvertently, attacked those who were protesting  Kiss of Love. This is why uniforms are so important. In the days that followed, the movement spread to other cities, including Delhi, where there were scuffles between the kissers and the guardians of culture. But the movement did not escalate, and it appears to have fizzled out, because most of its supporters wish to support their right to public expression in private. Also, most Indians oppose the public display of affection. Hindu nationalists and Muslim clerics are united against it. When Hindus and Muslims are united, it is usually against something fun. As with all of India’s struggles for modernity, the battle between the kissers and the guardians is also a battle between the city and the village, which are as much spectral spaces in the mind as they are physical. It is a clash between those who benefit from change and those who fear it, those who seek their identity in the dissolution of culture and those whose self-worth depends on its preservation.
