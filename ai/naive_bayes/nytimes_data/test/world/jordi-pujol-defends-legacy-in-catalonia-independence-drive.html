Jordi Pujol Defends Legacy in Catalonia Independence Drive
The legal problems of Mr. Pujol, a former leader of the Convergence party, have cast a shadow over the party’s push for independence from Spain.

MADRID — Jordi Pujol, the patriarch of Catalan politics, told lawmakers on Friday that money that he has admitted to hiding offshore was inherited and not earned from kickbacks or other corrupt practices during his 23 years in charge of the regional government. Mr. Pujol’s appearance before Catalonia’s regional parliament was closely watched in Spain and came at a critical moment for the northeastern region, which is pushing to hold a vote on independence from Spain on Nov. 9. Even after voters in Scotland rejected their own referendum this month on separating from the United Kingdom, Catalonia’s leaders have nevertheless vowed to press ahead. While Scotland’s independence would have been welcomed as a significant precedent, Artur Mas, the head of Catalonia’s regional government, has called the Scottish vote a “great lesson in democracy” and argued that Madrid should follow the example of the United Kingdom rather than try to block his plans. On Saturday, Mr. Mas is set to sign a decree to hold the vote, which the central government in Madrid considers illegal and has said it will appeal before Spain’s constitutional court. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is scheduled to convene a cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss court actions and other steps to prevent Catalonia from proceeding with its secessionist ambitions. The decree is based on a new referendum law that was approved by a majority of Catalan lawmakers in a parliamentary vote last week. The legal problems of Mr. Pujol, 84, have cast a shadow over the independence push. In July, Mr. Pujol admitted committing tax fraud by hiding money offshore. At least three of Mr. Pujol’s children are also under investigation for suspected financial crimes ranging from money laundering to bribery. The case is now threatening to discredit the Convergence party, which Mr. Pujol founded and ran from 1980 and 2003. Mr. Mas, who succeeded Mr. Pujol as party leader, has been trying to isolate the scandal as a personal issue that affects neither his government nor his secessionist push. “The existence of money overseas can be criticized but that doesn’t mean the origin of that money is illicit,” Mr. Pujol told lawmakers. “I can say very clearly that I’ve not been a corrupt politician,” he added. “I have never received money in return for a political or administrative decision.” Mr. Pujol did not answer specific questions from lawmakers about his wealth and possible links to past banking and construction scandals, including kickbacks paid for building the Palau de la Música, a concert hall in Barcelona. He said the money was inherited from his father, who died in 1980, who kept funds overseas because he feared that ”bad times would come” in Spain. Mr. Pujol said he inherited 140 million pesetas — Spain’s old currency — from his father, held offshore, equivalent to about $1.2 million. He said the amount increased after 1980 because of successive devaluations of the peseta, but he gave no information about his current assets or those of other family members. “You have lied to all Catalans,” Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, the leader of the Catalan branch of the Popular Party, told Mr. Pujol. “Today you don’t have the credibility to say whether you are a corrupt politician or not.” Visibly angered by such attacks, Mr. Pujol argued that he had instead “got naked in front of public opinion” and felt hurt by “the audacity of some of the comments.” He added: “If the government had been so corrupt and so bad, citizens would not have voted for it during 23 years.”
