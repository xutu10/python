JERUSALEM — A prominent Israeli activist who advocates more Jewish access and rights at a hotly contested Jerusalem holy site was shot and seriously wounded by an unknown assailant on Wednesday night, according to the police, amid spiraling tensions and conflict over religious claims to the site. Micky Rosenfeld, a spokesman for the police, said that a man in his 50s had been shot by an assailant who escaped on a motorcycle and that the police were looking into the background of the event, including the possibility that it was an assassination attempt carried out by a  The victim was identified as Yehuda Glick, a prominent American-born leader of the Temple Mount Heritage Foundation, a rightist group pushing for more Jewish access to Temple Mount, the sacred plateau revered by Jews as the site of ancient Jewish temples and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, the location of Al Aksa mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. The compound is in the Old City of Jerusalem in territory that Israel seized from Jordan in the 1967 war and then annexed in a move that was never internationally recognized. Tensions over the site, which is administered by the Muslim authorities, have sharply risen in recent months, with Muslim worshipers and protesters frequently clashing with the police. Palestinian leaders have decried the increasing Jewish presence on the mount, as Jewish activists have made a point of visiting more frequently. Under the status quo, Jews are allowed to visit the compound but not to pray there. President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority recently called on Palestinians to defend Jerusalem and the Muslim holy sites there “by all means.” The shooting took place outside the Menachem Begin Heritage Center in a predominantly Jewish area of central Jerusalem.
