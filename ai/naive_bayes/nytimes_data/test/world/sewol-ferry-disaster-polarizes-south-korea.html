Ferry Disaster, Which Once United South Korea, Now Polarizes It
As grieving families continue their demands for a full inquiry into the April disaster, the president’s supporters have started to criticize them.

SEOUL, South Korea — For months, the grieving parents of teenagers who  But as the protests continued through the summer, helping bring the Parliament to a standstill, the president’s conservative supporters began a campaign of their own that would have been unthinkable in the early days of the disaster. Some groups publicly accused the families of holding the country hostage. Others went so far as to pitch camp near the hunger strikers, taking selfies as they gorged on fried chicken, noodles and pizza. While even some government supporters called the eat-in cruel, it was another sign that more than five months after the sinking that once united South Korea in sorrow, the disaster is polarizing the nation, splitting it along familiar liberal-conservative lines and threatening to derail President Park Geun-hye’s political agenda. At the heart of the standoff is the parents’ deeply held belief that this is South Korea’s best chance to break the  “We are not demanding that our children be brought back — we know we cannot bring them back alive — but we want answers,” said Yoon Kyung-hee, whose 16-year-old daughter died on the ferry. “We just want those responsible to be investigated and punished to ensure this kind of catastrophe never happens again.” South Korea, which remains in a technical state of war with the North, has known its share of tragedy. But the Sewol’s sinking in April touched a particular nerve. Not only were 250 of the victims students from one high school, but they died partly because of  Prosecutors have since revealed that the ship had foundered in treacherous currents in part because it carried twice the maximum allowed cargo and because a renovation to generate more income had made it dangerously top-heavy. Regulators and South Korean Coast Guard officials had turned a blind eye, prosecutors said, and in at least one case the officials who declared the ship seaworthy did so after they were flown by the ferry company to a resort island. Shocked, the conservative Ms. Park promised to overhaul a system she said was hamstrung by “Mafia-like” collusion. Now, the parents and their supporters in the political opposition say the president has done too little to make good on that pledge, feeding a growing distrust of a government they say has been steadily eroding the country’s hard-won democracy through increased censorship of critics. The administration, they say, has not given satisfactory answers to basic questions about the bungled rescue effort — a list Ms. Yoon recently reeled off as she sat amid other protesters at their small tent city in central Seoul: Why did the crew give bad instructions? Why did the initial coast guard responders arrive without proper equipment or trained rescuers? Why did they not at least use megaphones to alert trapped passengers to abandon the vessel? Worse yet, she and other parents say, the government has tried to weaken the powers of an independent investigative commission that is expected be established. At the same time, they say, the government’s supporters have resorted to ideological name-calling reminiscent of the country’s 30 years of military dictatorship. Even as Ms. Yoon spoke, a handful of right-wing activists arrived with signs blaming “pro-North Korean commies” for the protests. “I try not to pay attention to them,” said Ms. Yoon, whose daughter would have turned 17 last Friday. “But if they ask me, I will tell them the same thing can happen to their own children. I will tell them, ‘Why don’t you look at the pictures of our children, look them in the eye and say what you are saying now.’  ” The administration has taken some steps to address the safety problems raised by the disaster. Ms. Park promised to disband the coast guard. And prosecutors’ investigations have led to charges against dozens of regulators, ferry company officials and crew members. But most of the officials on trial are low-level functionaries, and much of the investigators’ attention has focused instead on the  Ms. Park’s defenders also note that political gridlock had delayed related legislation, as opposition lawmakers had refused to deliberate any other bills while the two sides bickered over the independent commission. Late on Tuesday, the monthslong legislative logjam broke as the governing party and the main opposition party reached some compromises on the investigative commission and passed dozens of bills, most unrelated to the ferry disaster. Under the compromise, liberal lawmakers would have a say on who becomes the special prosecutor leading the new investigation. Although the government refused to give the commission subpoena and indictment powers, it said the panel would work closely with the special prosecutor who had that authority. (Granting broader authority to the panel, Ms. Park has said, would “shake the foundation of the judicial system.”) But the compromises could exacerbate the country’s divisions or isolate the families, who Ms. Park’s supporters say are holding back the country. The families have already rejected the plan, arguing that they also must have a say over who should be the special counsel and who is on the panel, since the opposition is likely to be bullied by the governing party. The families have tried to justify their demands by saying they are rooted in an increasing lack of trust in Ms. Park’s administration. That distrust deepened this month, when a former director of the country’s spy agency was convicted of interfering in politics ahead of the 2012 presidential election by ordering agents to carry out an online smear campaign against government critics, including Ms. Park’s opposition rivals. “If anything,” said Lee Byong-ik, a political commentator, “the Sewol disaster has worsened an ideological war in our country.” The situation has become so contentious that some conservatives publicly accused the father on the 46-day hunger strike of secretly taking nutritional supplements, and the parents’ liberal political supporters of using the disaster as a ploy to try to regain control. The disaster and the prolonged political infighting have taken a toll on Ms. Park, whose approval rating has slipped to about 50 percent in the most recent polls from more than 60 percent before the disaster. Despite her difficulties, Ms. Park is not yet in political danger, in part because her opposition has been deeply divided over how closely to align with the families’ demands. In parliamentary by-elections in July, the governing party won 11 of 15 contested seats. Still, even after her  “I am afraid that if we don’t discover the truth here, the country will return to the same old ways,” said Oh Byong-hwan, whose 17-year-old son died on the ferry. “We don’t have any goal other than making the country safer.”
