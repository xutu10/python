DONETSK, Ukraine — A Swiss employee of the International Committee of the Red Cross was killed Thursday evening when several artillery shells hit the organization’s offices in Donetsk, the largest rebel-held city in eastern Ukraine, officials said. The body of the man was identified by the police and Red Cross employees as the deputy head of the organization’s mission to eastern Ukraine. It was not immediately clear who fired the shells at the office, which is in the city center. The fighting in eastern Ukraine has not abated despite a recent cease-fire agreement. On Wednesday, rockets hit an elementary school and a city bus near the Donetsk airport, killing at least nine people.
