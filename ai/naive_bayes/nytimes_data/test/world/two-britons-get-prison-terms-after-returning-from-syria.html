Two Britons Get Prison Terms After Returning From Syria
The case has provoked a debate over how to counter returning jihadists without discouraging their families from cooperating with the authorities.

LONDON — Two Britons who fought in  The two men, Mohammed Ahmed and Yusuf Sarwar, had concealed their plans to travel to Syria in May 2013, but after they left, Mr. Sarwar’s mother found a letter explaining her son’s decision to “do jihad.” Mr. Sarwar’s family went to the police, and when the men, both 22 and childhood friends from Birmingham, returned to Britain in January, antiterrorism officers were waiting at Heathrow Airport near London. On Friday, Judge Michael Topolski sentenced each man to 12 years in prison, saying the defendants had “willingly, enthusiastically and with a great deal of purpose, persistence and determination embarked on a course intending to commit acts of terrorism.” “Both of these defendants are fundamentalists who are interested in and deeply committed to violent extremism,” the judge said at Woolwich Crown Court. While praising the bravery of Mr. Sarwar’s mother, Judge Topolski said he was just not able to reflect that in sentencing her son. Peter Neumann, the director of the  “As a result of this court case, they will not enlist the support of the authorities because they will understand that their kids will go to prison — and for long periods,” Mr. Neumann said. Mr. Ahmed’s family said that they, too, assisted the police, and in a statement, they said, “We feel completely betrayed,” and they criticized the sentence as “too long,” the BBC reported. Two others cases came before courts in Western Europe on Friday, highlighting the authorities’ growing concerns that those who fight abroad may come home to commit terrorism. Security officials estimate that about 3,000 Western Europeans have left their home countries to join the fight in Syria. Also in Britain on Friday, Mashudur Choudhury, 31, was sentenced to four years in prison after being convicted of preparing for acts of terrorism in Syria. And a court in Frankfurt sentenced a 20-year-old man who had traveled to  The man was identified only as Kreshnik B. because he was tried as a juvenile; German law allows young adults to be tried as juveniles if they are deemed to lack the maturity of an adult. The man’s sentence was focused on rehabilitation after he confessed to willingly quitting the militant group, also known as  Kreshnik B. told the court that while in Syria, he grew bored and frustrated that he and other Europeans with no prior military training were given limited responsibilities and sidelined from major battles. Last month, the  The details of the cases underline the potential for violence but also offer some prosaic details about those who leave to fight in Syria. Judge Topolski’s court heard that the two men sentenced on Friday were believed to have spent time with the Nusra Front, a radical group affiliated to Al Qaeda, and that when the men were stopped at Heathrow, the police found traces of explosives on their clothing and pictures of them brandishing weapons. The court was also told that Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Sarwar had ordered a book from Amazon called “Islam for Dummies.” Mr. Neumann, the radicalization expert, said returning jihadists fell into roughly three categories: “the dangerous, the disturbed or the disillusioned.” Those in the last category can often be reintegrated into society, but the strategies for dealing with such cases need to be more flexible, he said. “If families are getting involved,” he added, “there should be some kind of benefit, perhaps in terms of not being prosecuted or a form of plea bargaining.”
