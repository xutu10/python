NEW DELHI — Jayalalithaa Jayaram, the former chief minister of Tamil Nadu who was convicted of corruption charges last month, promised this week to give compensatory payments of about $4,800 each to the families of 193 followers who are said to have died or committed suicide out of distress because of her imprisonment. Ms. Jayaram, who was released on bail on Saturday pending an appeal, commands extraordinary devotion even by the operatic standards of South Indian politics. In late September, when she was sentenced to four years in prison for illegally enriching herself during the first of her three terms as chief minister, party faithful entered into a  Almost immediately, accounts emerged of followers who had committed suicide over the case, though it was impossible to independently confirm the reports. Ms. Jayaram’s party, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, claims that 193 people committed suicide or died of shock while she was behind bars, though that number includes 139 people who died of heart attacks during that period. Seventeen of the reported suicides were self-immolations, 20 were hangings and nine were deaths by poison, it said. C. Ponaiyan, the party’s state organization secretary, said officials made home visits to interview families and friends to determine whether reported deaths were actually because of Ms. Jayaram’s legal predicament. “If the local public at large says that so-and-so died because he was not eating for the past so many days, we can figure the heart attack might have taken place as a result of the trauma,” he said. “That so-and-so had been weeping and crying since the past so many days is enough to tell us the condition of the person’s heart and state of mind.” Officials from a rival party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, have questioned the veracity of the reported suicides. M. G. Devasahayam, a community activist, told the newspaper The Hindustan Times that the figure of 193 was “highly exaggerated and absurd.” Ms. Jayaram returned to her home in Chennai, the state capital, over the weekend, and released an impassioned statement to her followers, promising them she “would not be cowed down or lose heart.” “My public life amounts to swimming in a sea of inferno,” she said. “As your dear sister, I have realized the perils of dedicating oneself for the cause of public welfare from the day I entered politics.”
