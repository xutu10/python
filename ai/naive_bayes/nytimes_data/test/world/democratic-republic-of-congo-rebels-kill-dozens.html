Dozens of people were killed last week in an eastern region, lawmakers said Monday. The attack took place near Beni in North Kivu Province, where a mainly Ugandan rebel group has been blamed for killing more than 200 civilians since October. Juma Balikwisha, a member of Parliament, said 104 bodies were discovered after the latest attack, and another lawmaker, Albert Baliesima, put the toll at 70 to 100. The Civil Society of North Kivu, a nongovernmental group, blamed rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces and National Army for the Liberation of Uganda for the massacres. The rebels were driven out of Uganda in 1995.
