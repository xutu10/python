NEW DELHI —  Voters in a southeastern Sri Lankan province headed to the polls on Saturday in what is widely seen as a crucial test of whether President  The candidates for chief minister of Uva Province are seen as proxies for the coming battle for the presidency. Shashendra Rajapaksa, son of the speaker of Parliament and a nephew of the president, is the chief ministerial candidate from the dominant  Both sides held huge rallies in the days leading up to Thursday, when a 48-hour ban on politicking went into effect. In rallies in the towns of Mahiyangana and Wellawaya, President Rajapaksa emphasized that his government had  “The Rajapaksas can fight any type of war in a democratic manner to its conclusion,” he said. “The Rajapaksas do not need to bribe the people to attain political power.” The Sri Lankan government has been criticized by international human rights groups for failing to investigate allegations of possible war crimes during the war, in which as many as 40,000 civilians may have been killed in its final months. Uva is widely seen as a bastion of support for the governing party, which won 72 percent of the vote in the 2009 provincial elections and secured 25 of 34 seats in the Provincial Assembly. But the final rallies of the United National Party were packed, giving the opposition considerable hope. In the mountainous towns of Bandarawela and Badulla, the provincial capital, women and children huddled in the cold until well past midnight to cheer opposition politicians. The green banners of the United National Party fluttered throughout major district towns. “The tide has turned,” Mr. Fernando said in an interview. Rajpal Abeynayake, editor in chief of the government-owned Daily News, the country’s largest newspaper, predicted an easy victory for the governing party. And he said in an interview that the results would demonstrate that Mr. Rajapaksa was headed for a commanding re-election victory later this year or early next year, when the next presidential election is expected to be called. “The people here will vote for the leader they think is best for the country, not the person The New York Times and other foreign media think is best,” Mr. Abeynayake said. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based  President Rajapaksa’s victory in the civil war made him hugely popular in the immediate aftermath of the fighting, but it is unclear whether voters are happy with his stewardship of the country since the war’s end. Sri Lanka has received considerable investment from China while facing growing pressure from Western governments to improve its postwar reconciliation efforts. Mr. Saravanamuttu said that the governing and opposition parties have such differing expectations that he was unsure whether the government would allow a defeat to be registered or the opposition would accept a government victory as legitimate. Results are expected by midday Sunday. “Whatever happens, the Uva elections have become very important,” Mr. Saravanamuttu said.
