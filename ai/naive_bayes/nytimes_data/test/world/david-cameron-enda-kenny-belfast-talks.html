LONDON — The British and Irish prime ministers,  Mr. Cameron said the two leaders would press rival parties in Northern Ireland, the Roman Catholic Sinn Fein and the Protestant Democratic Unionist Party, to sustain their five-party coalition. The talks are expected to run into the weekend, with all sides hoping to find a solution by Christmas on complicated financial and cultural issues, including the promotion of the Gaelic language, the rights of Protestant groups to hold parades and the investigation of unsolved murders from the long conflict in Northern Ireland.
