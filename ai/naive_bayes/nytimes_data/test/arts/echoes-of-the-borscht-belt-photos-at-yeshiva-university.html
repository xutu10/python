‘Echoes of the Borscht Belt,’ Photos at Yeshiva University
An exhibition of photographs at the Yeshiva University Museum depicts the tattered remains of Catskills hotels where many Jews vacationed in the postwar period.

Some 20 years ago, whenever the self-styled  I came to know these places during their years of decline, accompanied by multiple generations of my family. And though signs of sclerosis were apparent — often, those of us of a less than certain age would affectionately roll our eyes — I don’t think we could have imagined the scenes of disintegration in the photographs by  By one count, there were over 900 such summer establishments in Sullivan and Ulster Counties, known informally as the borscht belt for its association with the Eastern European Jewish immigrations of the early 20th century. After the Second World War, the cold beet soup flowed with extravagant ease. And then, after the 1950s, came a change, and the region began a slow-motion decline. The reasons are well known: air-conditioned homes, cruise ships, Las Vegas, the 1960s. ... And a rising middle class descended from Jewish immigrants had begun to discover other ways to celebrate making it. These photographs,  These images are affectionate without being nostalgic. The wreckage they show is almost lush with new growth. And while they really can’t compete with history’s vast iconography of ruin, their effect is unusual: The landscape of abandonment still retains signs of vitality — and we’re aware of the remarkable impact that this vitality had on American popular culture. Hints of that life can also be glimpsed in a nearby display case featuring souvenirs, many of them from Ms. Scheinfeld’s personal collection: matchbooks, napkins, menus, poolside photographs and images of the swankier hotels’ performers: Sammy Davis Jr., Eddie Cantor, Duke Ellington. These pictures remind us that Las Vegas began its rise as the borscht belt began its fall: It was its de-Judaized transformation. During the period when I was sampling some of the belt’s last surviving notches, the energy was already long past, and everybody knew it. Many places were scraping by on ritual and habit, hoping that casino licenses —  For those of us visiting from more urbane habitats, it was occasionally tempting to approach all this with condescension or even scorn. But we also felt something else, almost a life force: These old forms retained elements of extraordinary vigor, even in their most mundane aspects. Veteran waiters, for example, would never use a pad or a pencil but commit a dozen orders to memory and then balance them all on enormous trays, each of which might have fed a village for a week in the old country. And entertainments were delivered with an unmistakably sincere and warm embrace, somehow managing to be old-fashioned without seeming campy. Days would pass without our missing in the least the more urbane and decorous cultural precincts we had embraced for ourselves, even as we yielded to bingo, indoor miniature golf, Simon Says and limitless appetite. Was there something intrinsic to these hotels that inspired this complex mixture of sentiments? Their history suggests we were not the first with such feelings. Many Catskill hotels evolved out of early-20th-century Jewish farms: Owners would supplement their meager earnings by renting out accommodations to city visitors. In Stefan Kanfer’s fine history, “A Summer World,” we learn that in 1913, the Galician refugees Selig and Malke Grossinger were encouraged by the Jewish Agricultural Society to set up a bucolic refuge in the Catskills. By the 1920s, that world had already inspired jests about an urban immigrant population with no traditional ties to outdoor life that had started to vacation in “the mountains.” The Jews have finally “had their revenge on the Gentiles who didn’t want to accept them,” the Yiddish newspaper The Forward observed. “Their gardens have now grown peyes, and their trees have been circumcised.” These hotels and bungalow colonies reflected the growing prosperity of their communities. Post-immigrant taste is almost always vulgar in some way, because it seeks to imitate what it cannot yet acquire. That was one reason for ostentatious displays. At the Concord, the Cordillion Room, where meals were served, accommodated 3,000 people. Grossinger’s indoor pool had 20-foot-high glass walls. These resorts were declarations of ambition and accomplishment: The immigrant past could be transcended. Some even shed ethnic associations, with names like the Raleigh or activities like horseback riding. And some had begun to inspire condescension from guests who felt they had already overcome the circumstances of their birth, despite their continuing return. But at the same time, these hotels celebrated that identity, offering an atmosphere of communal confidence. Even in their declining years, when they were marketing themselves as cosmopolitan resorts, remnants of a Jewish past were evident in the jokes and in the food. A Grossinger’s menu in the exhibition offers a “Boiled Young Fowl en Pot, Matzo Ball.” Somehow this hothouse mixture of opposing sentiments — self-derision mixed with self-embrace — also ended up transforming 20th-century American culture. Vaudeville had always mocked ethnic types.  Ultimately, it all went mainstream. In the early 1930s, Mr. Kanfer notes,  You won’t find all this at the exhibition, but if you have any experience with the complex relationship between identity and American culture — and who doesn’t? — you’re still hearing echoes of what happened in these now overrun ruins.
