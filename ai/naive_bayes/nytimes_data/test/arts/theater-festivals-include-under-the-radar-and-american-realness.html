MOST of us abandon our New Year’s resolutions. But if you vowed to see more live art in 2015, you can start keeping that one right away. A decade ago, January was a performance doldrums. No more. As thousands of curators pack the New York Hilton Midtown for the annual  Under the Radar Some of the performances are local; many are global. Some, like Reggie Watts’s takeoff of Marina Abramovic, are as short as five minutes. One, Temporary Distortion’s “My Voice Has an Echo in It” (part of Coil), lasts six hours. Some blare big names, like Prototype’s “Kansas City Choir Boy,” which co-stars Courtney Love; others unleash unknowns. Some are new; others are revivals of projects past, like the Team’s  Ms. Jarcho, speaking by telephone in late December, admitted that these weeks were a “challenging time to put on a show, because everyone feels overwhelmed at this time of year.” Still, she said, “If I didn’t have anything happening now, I’d maybe be a little extra sad and envious.” Who could blame her? Here’s a tease of this cold-weather panoply, from a “filmic drama” to a robot musical, from a glorious aerial act to a suicidal grand jeté.
