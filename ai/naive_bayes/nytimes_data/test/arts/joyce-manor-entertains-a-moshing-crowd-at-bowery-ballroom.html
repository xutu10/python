Joyce Manor Entertains a Moshing Crowd at Bowery Ballroom
Joyce Manor brought its pop-punk to the Bowery Ballroom while the crowd moshed and surfed.

Mere seconds after the band Joyce Manor’s introductory guitar punch at the Bowery Ballroom on Monday night, the crowd started an eager mosh, exultantly tossing cups of beer into the air. Up onstage, the frontman Barry Johnson was in upheaval, too, but mostly of the internal kind. “I want a heart tattoo,” he sang with angsty tang. “I want it to hurt really bad/ That’s how I’ll know/ I’ll know it’s real.” This was a moment of pining and emotional stress, one of many from this band’s recently released third album, “Never Hungover Again” (Epitaph). Joyce Manor makes pop-punk that’s mildly unfashionable but eminently agreeable — stories of self-doubt, in Mr. Johnson’s reliable whine, over music with a scrappy, rumbling core. The album moves quickly — 10 songs in 19 minutes — but feels meaty, thanks to blustery and sharp arrangements with echoes of Weezer. The show went on in similar fashion — a hungry scramble, followed by an exhale, and so on. The audience members, about half of whom spent their time bouncing against one another, were grateful for the breaks. Mr. Johnson was like a kind schoolteacher, passionately administering lessons, while the band churned behind him: determined guitar by Chase Knobbe, sloppy-punchy bass by Matt Ebert (who also sang earnest backup vocals) and forceful drums by Kurt Walcher. Mr. Johnson, though, sensed something sinister happening. He asked: “Ever been watching a sensitive pop-punk band,” and “get your head walked on?” For all the bumping and pushing, the mosh pit was often convivial. At one point Mr. Johnson asked after a crowd-surfer’s lost shoe, which was found, and during “Falling in Love Again,” he warmly patted the head of a stage-diver. But he noticed a few bad actors. He recognized the type, he said: “hardcore guys with Morrissey haircuts” who think nothing of “using a teenage girl’s face for leverage” to climb on top of the crowd. “I’m not about that,” he added. Indeed, at least two young women retreated from the center of the crowd clutching body parts in pain, though they both merrily returned. Midshow, one of the Morrissey-haircut guys climbed onstage for the second time, and Mr. Johnson motioned to a security guard at the side, who chased him down and forcibly removed him. But the tension in the room made sense — Joyce Manor is a taut, frenzied band with its heart on its sleeve. Some people respond with the body, some with the heart. That push and pull is integral to its sound. Mr. Johnson, though, imagined his show — and his music — as a safe space, one that needed to be protected. He closed the night with “Leather Jacket,” another song about wounds that don’t quite heal: “In your new leather jacket, you’re somebody else/ And it’s not nice to meet you in a fortress of self/ Thanks to your new leather jacket, we’re nobodies now.” After this, he turned away from the crowd and leaned back, lying down, safely, on a bed of upraised hands.
