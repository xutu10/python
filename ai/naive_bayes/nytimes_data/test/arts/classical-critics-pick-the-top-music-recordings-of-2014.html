Classical Critics Pick the Top Music Recordings of 2014
The classical music critics of The Times pick the best recordings of 2014, from orchestral explosions to intimate songs.

HERE it is: the annually anticipated choices from the classical music critics of The New York Times of the best recordings of 2014. First, though, a qualification: None of us remotely claims to have heard all the recordings of note released this past year. Still, among the ranks of music lovers, we are probably more aware than many of the range of what’s been issued. In the end, these are personal choices. The only ground rules were that we agreed not to duplicate one another’s selections, and that we would not pick more than five each. Looking over the complete list, I am struck, as in recent years, by how much the small independent labels, including new ones, have been breaking through with exciting recordings. The majors are still making news, of course, with projects like Sony’s boxed set of the complete Beethoven piano concertos featuring the pianist  How much money these projects will earn for the institutions, and how the small labels will fare over time, is hard to say. For now, though, lovers of classical music are the clear beneficiaries.
