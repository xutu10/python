John Legend Sings About Eric Garner and Michael Brown Cases
John Legend says his new song, “Glory,” used in the movie “Selma,” was written with the national mood in mind.

Best known for belting mushy neo-soul ballads from behind a piano, John Legend may seem, at first, an unlikely activist. For a decade now, his songs have tended to come more from the heart than the gut, ranging lyrically from repentance for romantic misdeeds to professions of eternal love. But since the summertime killings of Eric Garner on Staten Island, and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and throughout the nationwide protests since grand juries decided not to indict the white police officers involved in those cases, Mr. Legend has emerged as one of the more outspoken voices in pop music. Last week, after the grand jury decision in the Garner case, Mr. Legend joined the chorus of disbelief on Twitter. “I am stunned by the failure to indict Eric Garner’s killer,” he wrote to his more than six million followers. The next day, with what Mr. Legend said by phone from a tour stop in New Zealand was “a sense of urgency,” he released the song “Glory,” from the soundtrack for the forthcoming film  Featuring the rapper Common, who acts in the film, “Glory” is drumless and gospel-tinged, not out of step in sound with Mr. Legend’s typical fare. But the message is more pointed. “One day, when the glory comes, it will be ours,” Mr. Legend sings in the chorus. “One day, when the war is won, we will be sure.” The verses invoke the recent unrest in the context of the civil rights movement. “One son died, his spirit is revisiting us,” Common raps. “Resistance is us/That’s why Rosa sat on the bus/That’s why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up.” Mr. Legend said he and Common wrote the lyrics in October with both the historical achievements “Selma” celebrates and the current national mood in mind. “We knew that it was intended to be the end titles song and we wanted something that was a bit triumphant,” he said. “It is optimistic in a way, but it still recognizes that we haven’t accomplished what we set out to accomplish.” While Mr. Legend acknowledges that “Glory” is not quite Public Enemy’s  Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of African-American studies at Duke University, said “Glory” follows the tradition of Sam Cooke, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye, whose memorable political forays came relatively late in their careers. “The artists don’t move the movement, the artists are responding to the movement,” he said. “There are lots of artists who were pushed to be more political because there was a movement that gave them cover.” Until now, for a mainstream R & B singer like Mr. Legend, Professor Neal added, “there wasn’t a movement out there that could push him to rethink his music.” (Mr. Legend’s 2010 album with the Roots, “Wake Up!,” featured covers of politically charged soul songs, but from an earlier era.) Other scattered musical responses to the Brown and Garner cases across hip-hop and R & B have failed to take a strong cultural hold, with the rappers J. Cole and Killer Mike leaving a deeper imprint with  But Mr. Legend’s contributions have not just been artistic. With his wife, the supermodel Chrissy Teigen, Mr. Legend donated more than $10,000 to feed protesters in New York on Sunday. “I look at these young people who are out marching and some have been doing it for weeks and months now,” he said. “They need resources, they need supplies.” For an otherwise wholly uncontroversial musician, a political stance carries risks. “I certainly catch some flak for it,” he said. On Twitter, “People tell me to shut up and sing.” But Mr. Legend, who was 16 when he enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, where he focused on African-American literature, is confident in his awareness. “If you just discovered me through ‘All of Me,’ ” he said, citing his most successful single, which hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts this year, “maybe you’re surprised. But I feel like I have to speak out when I believe in something. I know what I’m talking about.”
