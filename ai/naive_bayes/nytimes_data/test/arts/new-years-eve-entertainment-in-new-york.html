New Year's Eve Entertainment in New York
From electronic dance music to smooth jazz to rough comedy, New York is readying a cityscape of parties for New Year’s Eve.
===
For tens of thousands of people in New York, the first steps of the new year will be taken on a dance floor. Some want to celebrate the year just past, some to blot it out; some anticipate the coming year, some hope to stave off the dread. On New Year’s Eve the city’s clubs, restaurants, bars and concert halls welcome them all for the annual night of (mostly) premium prices and ritual excess. Electronic dance music has taken over Madison Square Garden, where jam bands like Phish long claimed New Year’s Eve; the newer arena in town, Barclays Center, reaches back generationally to Elton John. Across the city other options abound: mostly party music with an occasional, stubborn bit of counterprogramming. Here culture writers of The New York Times survey the choices before and after midnight.
