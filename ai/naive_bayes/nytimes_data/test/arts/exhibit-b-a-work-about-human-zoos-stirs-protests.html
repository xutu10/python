‘Exhibit B,’ a Work About Human Zoos, Stirs Protests
“Exhibit B,” a traveling show that mimics the human zoos of the colonial era, is prompting cries of racism in Europe.

PARIS —  Jelle Saminnadin plays a black odalisque, a seminude Congolese slave gazing in a gilded mirror. A leather bond encircles her neck and chains her to a bed of lace and pillows in a scene mimicking a colonial human zoo of the early 20th century. The image is one of a dozen living portraits in a traveling art installation, “Exhibit B,” by the South African playwright and installation artist  For more than four years, Exhibit B’s performers roamed a European circuit without much attention, appearing in a German ice store; in the Hofburg, the Viennese palace; and an ancient Avignon church, a performance hailed in 2013 by the French daily Le Monde as a “grand ceremony, between revelation and prayer.” In the beginning, it attracted small demonstrations, but with growing attention, opposition is rising. Hundreds of protesters massed outside a London theater to press successfully for  In reaction, museum and theater directors from 14 countries that have hosted the installation issued a joint letter denouncing censorship and defending “Exhibit B” as a “subtle and humane” work that has drawn more than 25,000 spectators. “I see the impact on visitors,” said Ms. Saminnadin, a French actress who described how spectators lock eyes with her in silent connection as she gazes at them from the mirror, her back turned to them. “Women, in particular, cry. And it is almost as if they share my suffering.” The show’s creator, Mr. Bailey, 47, said he was inspired to create the work in 2010 after reading a book about the phenomenon of human zoos. It spread across Europe, surfacing as well in the United States, where a Congolese man was displayed in 1906 at the Bronx Zoo monkey house, armed with bows and arrows. “Human zoos really legitimized the colonial process by dehumanizing people,” Mr. Bailey said between rehearsals this month at the Musée de Ste.-Croix in Poitiers, in west-central France. “Colonizers could stride into people’s lands and destroy their social, cultural and political systems because they portrayed them as barbarians. These images legitimized the systems I grew up with — apartheid.” At the Poitiers museum, Mr. Bailey rearranged 19th-century oil paintings of skulls and nude sculptures to match symbols with his living portraits. “Remember, you are the real spectators, and they are the performers,” he said, coaching the artists to hold their gaze on visitors. In one tableau, a woman sat beside an enormous pot, holding a skull and a glass shard. A placard recounted how African women in a concentration camp in German South-West Africa (now Namibia) boiled and scraped skulls clean to send to Germany for pseudoscientific examination in the early 20th century. It is a bleak past that institutions and museums are still reckoning with. The Canadian government is discussing the repatriation of the skulls of five Labrador In 2011, the  The living portraits recount the buried history of human menageries in different countries. Typically, spectators enter one by one, called by a number. During a dress rehearsal, the songs of a Namibian choir drifted from a scene in which the singers were encased in white pillars except for their heads. Nearby was a more contemporary portrait, a Somali man strapped in a row of airline seats, his mouth taped shut. In front of him was a tally of 14 asylum seekers who died of asphyxia or heart attacks on forced returns to their home countries from Europe since the 1990s. Despite this emphasis on history, critics are not satisfied with Mr. Bailey’s explanation that he is exposing racism, particularly because he is white, and the black performers remain mute. “It shows a lie, really,” said John Mullen, a history professor at the University of Paris East. “It shows the victims without the perpetrators. The black victims are silent, immobile and fetishized, while the colonialists are absent.” Mr. Mullen organized a petition on change.org calling for the cancellation of the Paris shows, so far gathering more than 19,000 signatures, including from politicians, writers, sociologists and local rappers. He is part of a newly formed opposition group, Against Exhibit B, that is preparing a demonstration for the opening at the Théâtre Gérard Philippe. The group, according to Mr. Mullen, is also laying the legal groundwork to challenge the performance as an attack on human dignity: an argument that led to a French ban on “dwarf tossing” in 1995 that was later upheld by a United Nations human rights and anti-discrimination committee. “I consider it exploitation of black bodies,” said Bams, a rap and electro singer who is part of the opposition group and performs professionally under that name, a reference to the Bamiléké people of western Cameroon. “The performers are reduced to objects who cannot speak a word. Brett Bailey says he wants to sensitize people to racism, but I think it is simply racist.” So far, the directors hosting the exhibition at various French museums are resisting the criticism and citing the power of the work to teach people about forgotten history. In St.-Denis, the theater’s new director, Jean Bellorini, organized a meeting between Mr. Bailey and representatives of local community groups. Mr. Bellorini said he was open to debate, but would not accept censorship. The four nights of the exhibition are sold out, he said, and he expects a very diverse audience from the surrounding suburb, which is home to a large African immigrant population. “There is no degrading moment in this exhibit,” Mr. Bellorini said. “It forces us to analyze history and to question very clearly how we came to where we are.” Critics like Mr. Mullen said that the discussions had been stage- managed and that they want an open debate with the creator. But Mr. Bailey is reluctant, saying, “My fear is that I don’t think there is a real desire to talk together.” In coming months, he said, he will return home to Cape Town and is considering a performance art project to take a break from the controversy. It’s a small piece, he said, an installation called “Sanctuary,” about the sexual abuse of children by priests and Boy Scout leaders.
