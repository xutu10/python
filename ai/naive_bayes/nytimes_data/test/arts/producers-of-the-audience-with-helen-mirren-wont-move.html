Producers of ‘The Audience,’ With Helen Mirren, Won’t Move
The Broadway producers of “The Audience,” with Helen Mirren playing Queen Elizabeth II, have turned down $400,000 to let “It’s Only a Play” continue next year in the Schoenfeld Theater.

How badly did the Broadway producers of “The Audience,” a  That’s a tidy sum in an industry where many plays cost $4 million to produce, and most end up losing money. But with  For audiences, the competition matters, because the right theater’s architecture and acoustics can enhance their experience. Such was the thinking of the team behind “The Audience,” which takes place inside Buckingham Palace over the course of 60 years as Queen Elizabeth II (Ms. Mirren) meets with a succession of prime ministers, from Winston Churchill to David Cameron. The recently restored Schoenfeld, with its gleaming chandeliers and its ornate panels of flowers and vines in gold leaf, has a majestic quality that some other Broadway playhouses lack. “The  But the Schoenfeld is also the home of another show, Terrence McNally’s “It’s Only a Play,” whose producers have a hit on their hands — and were ready to do a deal with “The Audience” to stay put. A comedy starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, That closing date was also in place because when “It’s Only a Play” lined up the Schoenfeld for this fall, “The Audience,” which had its premiere in London, already had it locked up for spring 2015. Then two things happened in October. Ticket sales for “It’s Only a Play” continued to boom, which convinced its producers that the show could run longer. And the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater — another prime playhouse that is adjacent to the Schoenfeld — was to become open in January, a result of the announcement that  “Pretty quickly, we started asking ourselves, ‘Is there a world where we can just stay at the Schoenfeld, and “The Audience” can go next door?’ ” said Tom Kirdahy, one of the lead producers of “It’s Only a Play.” An alternative — moving “It’s Only a Play” from the Schoenfeld to the Jacobs — would have cost roughly $800,000, given the union contracts for loading sets and other equipment out of one theater and into another. While hit musicals sometimes switch theaters, as “Mamma Mia!” did in 2013, they do so when they are already profitable and a continued run is usually worth the move. Plays rarely move: “August: Osage County” transferred from the 1,450-seat Imperial Theater to the 1,000-seat Music Box Theater in 2008, providing a meaningful savings on rent (given the smaller theater) and making way for the musical “Billy Elliot,” as its landlord wanted. (That landlord, the Shubert Organization, also owns the Schoenfeld and the Jacobs, as well as 13 other houses.) Mr. Kirdahy said he was ready to offer about $400,000 — half of the $800,000 transfer cost — to “The Audience” producers if they would take the Jacobs instead. But they stuck fast to the Schoenfeld and wouldn’t even discuss a deal. The producers of “The Audience” said in a statement that the Schoenfeld was too important to Mr. Daldry and the creative team to give up. “The production design was specifically adapted for this theater,” they said. “The sets have evolved from the London production, with designer Bob Crowley adding and incorporating the specific architectural elements of this particular theater, which would have to be reconceived in another venue.” Inconveniencing people already holding tickets to “The Audience” at the Schoenfeld was another downside, they added. “The Audience” was written by Peter Morgan, who worked with Ms. Mirren on an earlier Elizabeth II project, the movie “The Queen.” Coming to Broadway was dependent on the right theater and an opening in Ms. Mirren’s schedule. Her personal preferences for a theater were not a factor, according to the producers, who said she “would have been fine in either theater.” In some ways, Ms. Mirren might have had a better time in the Jacobs; the steps up to the Schoenfeld dressing rooms are notoriously steep. Those steps are among several differences between the two theaters, which look like twins at first to the naked eye, and are among the most coveted by Broadway producers. “Both theaters are intimate downstairs and have audience-friendly balconies — there’s nary a bad seat in either house,” said John Breglio, who produced the 2006 revival of “A Chorus Line” in the Schoenfeld. “Sightlines are very good, and their locations on 45th Street are the best.” Referring to the two former leaders of the Shubert Organization for whom the theaters are named, he added, “There’s good reason why Bernie and Gerry got those theaters named after them, and not the Cort or the Longacre,” two other Shubert houses. Each has about 1,080 seats, with about 620 in the orchestra section that can sell for $150 to $300 each. But the Schoenfeld’s restoration last year has made it even more of a gem, though its small bathrooms have some of the longest lines on Broadway. The Jacobs, in turn, hasn’t been renovated since the 1980s, and its red and gray scheme — and two large Spanish-themed murals — hardly bring British royalty to mind. In the end, Mr. Kirdahy decided to move “It’s Only a Play” to the Jacobs, announcing last week that the show would go there in January and extend performances into the spring. He said he was confident that ticket sales for the production, which is on the cusp of turning a profit, would more than cover the cost of transferring. He and his fellow producers are also hoping that the loss of Mr. Lane, a big box office draw, won’t hurt sales; Martin Short is “I won’t lie, I was truly disappointed that we couldn’t keep the Schoenfeld,” Mr. Kirdahy said. “But I totally understood: It’s so hard to get your first-choice theater right now; I wouldn’t want to give up mine, either.”
