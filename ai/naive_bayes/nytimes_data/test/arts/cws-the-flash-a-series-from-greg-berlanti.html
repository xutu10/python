Grant Gustin of “Glee” winningly plays the title character in “The Flash,” on CW, a man with superspeed.

You can write about “The Flash” as a comic-book show or a superhero show, but it makes just as much sense to write about it as a Greg Berlanti show. Mr. Berlanti doesn’t get the attention that goes to one-show-at-a-time auteurs like Vince Gilligan and Matt Weiner, and he’ll probably never turn out a series like “Breaking Bad” or “Mad Men.” But he and his company, Berlanti Productions, make a lot of television, and they don’t turn out duds. “Everwood,” “Dirty Sexy Money,” “Eli Stone,” “No Ordinary Family,” “Brothers & Sisters,” the underrated “Golden Boy,” “Arrow”: in terms of light, dependable mainstream television, that list reflects a high level of quality control. And  Sure, his father is serving a life sentence for killing his mother. That provides the mandatory long story arc, but the emphasis in the pilot is on the joy that Barry, winningly played by Grant Gustin of “Glee,” feels when he streaks through crowds or clogged streets to catch a criminal. (The superspeed special effects are a mixed bag — minimal and effective from a distance, hokey in the close-ups.) “The Flash” is notably lighter, brighter and jokier than its companion show on CW, “Arrow,” where Barry was introduced in two episodes last season. It’s working quickly to achieve a comfort level, and the casting seems to reflect that: Familiar prime-time faces like Jesse L. Martin of “Law & Order” and Tom Cavanagh of “Ed” show up, playing very different father figures for Barry. Among the fall’s three new comic-book shows, “Gotham” and “Constantine” were both bound to go the dark and violent route. “The Flash” goes another way, which might not endear it to the comics fans but could attract an audience just looking for something fun.
