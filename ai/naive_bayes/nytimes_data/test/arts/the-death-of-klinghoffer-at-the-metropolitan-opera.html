‘The Death of Klinghoffer’ at the Metropolitan Opera
The Metropolitan Opera’s staging of John Adams’s controversial 1991 work, “The Death of Klinghoffer,” has been drawing furious protests in advance of its Monday night premiere.
===
In 492 B.C., just two years after the occupying Persians brutally suppressed a rebellion in the Greek city of Miletus, the playwright Phrynichus produced a tragedy about the disaster. He gave it a simple, straightforward title: “The Capture of Miletus.” Like many dramatists, ancient and modern, he must have hoped that a ripped-from-the-headlines subject would have a particularly powerful effect on his audience. But he couldn’t have anticipated what happened on opening night, when the crowd in Athens, whose ties to Miletus ran deep, grew so distraught at the reminder of its recent misfortune that Phrynichus was fined a thousand drachmas, and future stagings of the play were banned. When the arts play with contemporary history, they play with fire. The Metropolitan Opera has learned this lesson anew in the furious protests that have raged in advance of the  With a poetic, often enigmatic libretto by Alice Goodman, the work is consciously modeled on the Bach Passions, with Bach’s Evangelist metamorphosed into the opera’s nameless Captain, helplessly recalling the loss of his ship. Much of the language is retrospective in gaze and melancholy in tone. Seemingly crucial plot incidents — Klinghoffer’s murder, for example — take place offstage, while brooding choruses further fragment what is already stylized, sometimes inscrutable action. From its premiere in Brussels in March 1991 — despite the subsequent cut of a particularly debated scene and a wide range of directorial approaches — “Klinghoffer” has remained a flash point. Mr. Adams and Ms. Goodman have been accused of being insensitive, anti-Israel and even anti-Semitic in a work that gives a voice (often a beautiful one) to terrorists and suggests an explanation (though not an excuse) for their actions in the vexed history of the Palestinian people through centuries. Planned runs of Peter Sellars’s original production in Los Angeles and at the Glyndebourne Festival in England were canceled not long after the opera was unveiled, as was a Boston Symphony Orchestra performance of the score’s shining choruses in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. But it seemed, in recent years, that the controversy over “Klinghoffer” was subsiding. Mr. Adams conducted a concert performance at the Juilliard School in 2009, attracting little protest. A staging at the Opera Theater of St. Louis  So the ferocity directed since the spring at the Met’s “Klinghoffer,” conducted by David Robertson and starring Michaela Martens, Paulo Szot and Alan Opie, has taken both the company and the opera’s creators by surprise. “I expected there would be some pushback,” Mr. Adams said by phone recently. “But to see posters saying the opera is pro-terrorist, it’s really kind of shocking.” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, decided in June to bow to pressure from the Anti-Defamation League, as well as to the concerns of what he described in an interview as “three or four” of the Met’s major Jewish donors, and  The situation is a reminder that the Met and its imprimatur retain a unique position in the performing arts, just as New York retains a unique position in the Jewish diaspora. It was perhaps naïve to assume that “Klinghoffer” would be greeted, at its arrival at the world’s most prominent and influential opera company, by a few annoyed emails. As the musicologist Robert Fink writes in his wry, cleareyed 2005 essay  Several of the prominent reviews of that presentation, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in September 1991, including one by Edward Rothstein  Some of the intensity of those early responses can be traced to a scene that was included in the original version of the opera. Set in suburban New Jersey, the long sequence depicted the fictional Rumor family, Jewish friends of the Klinghoffers, babbling and bickering in a mode that served as a satire of American bourgeois materialism and as a lighter counterpoint to the sobriety that surrounded it. While Mr. Adams and Ms. Goodman had effectively handled similar contrasts of tone in their previous opera, “Nixon in China,” the subject matter there had been far less inflammatory. They soon cut the Rumor scene, but the impression has proved stubborn that the opera juxtaposes for effect the supposed triviality of Jews — and American Jews in particular — with the deeper, if doubtless violent, longings of the Palestinian characters. These are outdated talking points, but many of those most offended by the opera seem not to have seen or heard it; they seem more familiar with out-of-context quotations from the libretto or old articles peddled by interest groups. Years after the passage was excised, the musicologist Richard Taruskin again invoked it in  The Rumor scene was originally positioned between the work’s opening choruses: the first taking the voice of what the libretto terms “exiled Palestinians” and the second that of “exiled Jews,” both setting the stage for the Achille Lauro hijacking in the creation of the modern state of Israel after  On the contrary, it is certainly possible to hear these opening choruses as weighted, in terms of a listener’s sympathy, toward the exiled Jews, whose post-Holocaust dispossession leads to serene, productive hope, while the exiled Palestinians can feel shrill, unanimous and useless in their rage. And while the terrorists do sing and poetize in a mode similar to that of the other characters, they don’t come across exactly as humanized, or even as human. Then again, no one really does in the opera, which intentionally strove, at least in its original iteration, for a certain degree of detachment and abstraction: “a next chapter of ‘Einstein on the Beach,' ” as Mr. Sellars put it in a phone interview. Arriving so soon after the events it depicted, “Klinghoffer” wasn’t meant to evoke CNN. With images of the Achille Lauro still in wide circulation, the creators thought it unnecessary to represent those images onstage. “You couldn’t just make it entertainment or a sizzling dramatic evening,” Mr. Sellars said. “That’s just not adequate. It has to be something much more than that.” So Mr. Sellars’s production was austere and symbolic, a kind of mourning ritual with a shimmering gold-and-silver scaffoldlike set, dancers integrated into the action — their choreography was by Mark Morris — and costumes in delicate, warm pinks, greens and earth tones. The performers were dressed almost identically, so while the characters were conceived as individuals, the audience couldn’t easily distinguish them. There were no Bermuda shorts in sight. “It was very grave and sublimated,” Mr. Adams recalled. “And it was, frankly, also very confusing.” To reduce this confusion — to make the piece, for better or worse, more like a traditional opera than a Passion — recent productions of “Klinghoffer” have edged more toward literalism. (There have been exceptions, including a semi-staged revival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2003, dominated by projections, and a radically spare version in Rotterdam in 2004.) Penny Woolcock’s powerfully, sometimes excessively, clear and direct  “One of the things that first struck me is that it’s not put together in order to deliver a narrative to people who aren’t already familiar with it,” Tom Morris said of the opera. “It may be that when it was first staged, showing the events of the hijacking wasn’t necessary. But you can’t expect an audience in 2014 to know exactly what happened with the hijacking of the Achille Lauro.” In other words, expect Bermuda shorts at the Met, as well as naturalistic interactions between the performers. As in Ms. Woolcock’s film, but not in Ms. Goodman’s libretto, Klinghoffer’s murder takes place in full view of the audience. The set, by Tom Pye, suggests a ship without depicting it directly, while also evoking barren expanses of desert. Finn Ross’s video projections include both purely literal images and more metaphorical hints of landscape and water. The performers are surrounded by shifting walls made to resemble the looming concrete barrier that Israel erected in the West Bank. “The design refers to Israel and Palestine as territory, as a place, as land,” Mr. Morris said. “The drama of the hijacking is played out on top of that, in the way that the libretto suggests that this crime, which took place on a ship, fits on that physical terrain, that disputed terrain.” By now, the opera itself is a terrain nearly as disputed as the land it takes as its subject. In an interview, Mr. Morris was firm about the work’s beauty and emotional force, but he said that he would have liked to have spoken with the Klinghoffer daughters, emphasizing that it was vital for artists to communicate carefully and sensitively with those personally affected by their work. “I do think there are times when a whole society might be too traumatized by events to be ready for a story that’s about those events,” he said, invoking what could be called the Phrynichus Problem. But this was not, he clearly implied, one of those times.
