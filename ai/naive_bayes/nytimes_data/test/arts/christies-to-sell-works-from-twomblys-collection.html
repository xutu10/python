Christie’s to Sell Works From Twombly’s Collection
Several pieces from Cy Twombly’s collection, not including work he made himself, will be sold by Christie’s in November.

When Cy Twombly collectors hear that Christie’s is planning to sell 11 works from his foundation on Nov. 12 and 13, they will immediately assume they will be a selection of that artist’s work from all periods and media. But it turns out that none are by Twombly. Instead, they are rare examples of paintings, drawings and sculptures from his personal collection. Created by some of his friends — Lichtenstein, Warhol, Bruce Nauman and Claes Oldenburg — they were either trades he made with these artists or things he bought over the years simply because he loved them. “This group represents a long tradition of artists who collected each other’s work,” said Laura Paulson, a director of postwar and contemporary art at Christie’s. Executed between 1961 and 1966, they represent a glimpse of two generations of camaraderie that existed at the Leo Castelli Gallery, which represented Twombly for more than 40 years. Considered among the gems are three drawings by Lichtenstein, including “Hot Dog,” from 1964, that is estimated to sell for $1.5 million to $2 million. Like the Coca-Cola bottle, this 50-inch-long drawing is a Pop interpretation of one of postwar America’s favorite fast foods. The sale will also include two rare works by Bruce Nauman. One of them, “Device to Hold a Box at a Slight Angle,” a 1966 cast resin and painted sculpture, from that artist’s first show at Castelli that was organized by David Whitney, the curator, is expected to bring $900,000 to $1.5 million. “There’s something in the handmade aspect to it which has a direct connection to Cy’s early sculptures,” Ms. Paulson said. “Whereas Pop Art is about shiny everyday objects, this is the antithesis.” The entire group is estimated to bring around $15 million. THINKING BIG IN MARFA This week, the 86-year-old artist Robert Irwin was recalling the first time he met Donald Judd. “It must have been at least 40 years ago,” he said. “I was on a car trip, and stopped in Marfa to get a Coke. Don saw me sitting on a bench and came over and we started talking. He told me he was there to look over the town.” And look over it Judd did, eventually buying a defunct Army base in this tiny West Texas town and transforming it into the  Things take time to percolate in Marfa. “Judd had written about artists he wanted to see here and Bob Irwin was among them,” said Jenny Moore, executive director of the foundation. And for more than 15 years now, Mr. Irwin has been working and reworking his ideas to create a giant installation in Marfa. His vision is finally inching closer to reality. This week, Ms. Moore said construction on Mr. Irwin’s project will begin early next year and be completed and open to the public in 2016. Getting the money together to pay for the $5 million project has taken time. But, Ms. Moore said, so far more than half of it has been raised, including a $750,000 matching grant from the  Mr. Irwin’s installation — a U-shape construction about 10,000 square feet — will occupy the footprint of a former hospital and will be the first major addition to Chinati’s permanent collection since the 2004 opening of a gallery devoted to the painter John Wesley. In keeping with the other buildings at Chinati, Mr. Irwin described the structure as “a barracks with concrete walls.” The heart of his creation, however, is the treatment of the windows. With tinting and scrims, he will be manipulating the views and the quality of light. So when visitors are in the building looking out, they will see a thin strip of land and vast expanse of sky. “It’s just like a Dutch landscape painting,” Mr. Irwin explained. Sky, land and light are what this installation is all about, because, he added, “that is what I think is magical about Marfa.” POSTERS FOR $55 While Adrian Rosenfeld was working at the Matthew Marks Gallery, he spent the better part of 15 years handling multimillion-dollar artworks by the likes of Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly and Brice Marden. So this summer, when he decided to leave the gallery and strike out on his own, he didn’t want only to do what so many of his peers have done before him: become a private dealer. While he concedes that, yes, he will do some traditional dealing, he is also creating a business that will make contemporary art affordable to anyone with an extra $55 in the piggy bank. He and Athena Currey, a model and former dealer herself, are starting an e-commerce company based in Los Angeles called the Posters, expected to start Dec. 1, which will sell commissioned posters by artists Mr. Rosenfeld thinks are “current and relevant,” for $55 each. The posters will be 24-by-30-inch lithographs. But here’s the catch: Each will be available for only a month, sold either online —  “Posters are the collector’s gateway drug,” Mr. Rosenfeld said. “They are how you eventually get hooked on the big stuff.” He added, “It’s no accident that Larry Gagosian started out selling posters or that Matthew Marks had a pop-up poster shop in Chelsea in 2010.” Among the first artists to be sold at the Posters will be two New Yorkers, Nate Lowman and Wyatt Khan,
