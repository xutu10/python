Case Scaglione Leads the Philharmonic and Joshua Bell
Case Scaglione conducted the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall in a program of Debussy, Glazunov and Prokofiev’s Symphony No. 5.

In an ideal performance of Debussy’s “ But more routine performances of this now ever-popular piece, inspired by a poem by Stéphane Mallarmé, reduce the music to mere prettiness. And it certainly sounded very lovely on Wednesday evening when  But for all of its prettiness, the performance as a whole lacked an essential sensuality, the languid daydreams of the fantasizing faun sounding more G-rated than erotic. The performance  Joshua Bell, usually a charismatic performer with an effortless technique and sweet tone, seemed less at ease than usual both technically and musically. A dutiful soloist on this occasion, he failed to convey the brooding, dark-hued melodies with sufficient warmth and passion; the orchestra sounded similarly unconvincing. But the second half of the program proved much more memorable. Mr. Scaglione, the Philharmonic’s associate conductor, led a richly detailed interpretation of Prokofiev’s Symphony No. 5, which the composer described as an effort at “glorifying the grandeur of the human spirit” and the culmination of his creative life. Written in 1944, it was a hit with Soviet authorities and audiences. Mr. Scaglione vividly conveyed the work’s optimism and energy. The conclusion of the first movement attracted a lone outburst of clapping, quickly stifled, as is unfortunately still usually the case during symphonic concerts, where outdated protocols about applause still hold sway. Mr. Scaglione also revealed the melancholic undertones of the third movement Adagio. The orchestra performed with crisp wit in the lively Scherzo and with vigor and polish in the dynamic concluding movement, after which the audience broke into spontaneous and hearty applause.
