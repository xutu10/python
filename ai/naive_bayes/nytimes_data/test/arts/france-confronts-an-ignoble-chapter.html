France Confronts an Ignoble Chapter
In Paris, an exhibition at the National Archives looks at French people who were genuine supporters of the Nazis during World War II.

PARIS —  The 1942 telegram signed by one of the highest officials of the collaborationist  “The head of state wants you to take personal control of the measures taken with regard to the foreign Jews,” wrote René Bousquet, who was Vichy’s chief of police at the time. “You should not hesitate to destroy any resistance you may encounter among these populations.” The telegram was part of Bousquet’s legal file after he was formally accused in 1989 of crimes against humanity for orchestrating the roundup of Jews and for ordering the deportation of Jewish children. (He had largely escaped punishment for his collaboration just after the war, but was murdered in 1993 while the charges were being investigated.) The typewritten telegram, whose paper has turned yellow with age, is part of 300 documents, including letters, photos, personal items, posters, police files and books that are on display at a new exhibition at the National Archives museum here. The exhibition, called  The subject of collaboration has recently been explored in books, movies, documentaries and even television series, like “Un Village Français,” which started in 2009. It is part of a broader reckoning by France of its inglorious past. The French perception of how the country behaved during the occupation has changed. France was initially portrayed as a nation of resisters, but by the 1990s, President Jacques Chirac was citing the nation’s “collective wrongdoing.” Today, historians define France’s collaboration as a political, administrative, economic, military, ideological and cultural alliance with the Nazis. But “behaviors differed” among individuals, said  Mr. Peschanski said the exhibition distinguishes between collaborationists and collaborators — “between those who were entirely allied with the occupier and those who accommodated to the circumstances.” The collaborationists did not merely assist the Germans by following orders from Vichy or by seeking personal profit, but rather sought to achieve France’s resurgence through Nazi rule, he said. Despite its provocative focus, the show has drawn a muted but largely positive response in France. For two years, five curators, including Mr. Peschanski, delved into regional, national and foreign archives to document the extent of the ideological component of French collaboration. The show, which also includes loans from private collections, traces the chronology of collaboration, from the armistice signed with Germany in 1940 to the treason trial of Marshal Philippe Pétain, head of the Vichy regime, in 1945. It encompasses six rooms, each illustrating a theme, including joint actions of the French and German police. Visitors walk through corridors to the sounds of wartime songs and speeches by Pétain and Pierre Laval, Vichy’s chief minister. “I want Germany to win because, without it, Communism will settle in everywhere,” Laval said in one speech from 1941. Though the French government opened most of its archives on collaboration in the 1970s, this show features some documents that are being displayed publicly for the first time. These include a letter from the prominent novelist Louis-Ferdinand Céline congratulating Lucien Rebatet, a collaborationist writer, for his lengthy pamphlet “Les Décombres,” or “The Ruins.” The book, written in 1942, called for murdering Jews. “How beautiful, complete, brimming with infectious perfection all of this is!” Céline wrote. Among the rare images on display is a photo of Hitler’s ambassador to Vichy, Otto Abetz, with Pétain and Laval. The photo was taken only hours before the famous moment when  In another photo, taken on July 3, 1942, Pétain, Laval and Bousquet, the police chief, are seen walking out of the minister’s council in Paris just after Laval announced to his government that France would organize the largest mass arrest of Jews in wartime France, known as the  The exhibition offers a rare glimpse into the leaders, violent propaganda and rhetoric of collaboration. The collections include insignia, leaflets, letters and other items that belonged to openly fascist politicians, including Jacques Doriot, who founded the ultranationalist  Visitors can see Déat’s diary, where he related his encounter with Paul Marion, then Vichy’s general secretary for information. “Mr. Marion wants to treat the French like sick people, and carry out psychiatric propaganda,” Déat wrote. “He is a true collaborationist, and a very anti-British one. In short, he has good intentions.” Another room has the trunk that Doriot took to the Eastern Front after he joined the French unit of the German Army. The historian Tal Bruttmann said the exhibition’s strength was its insights into the importance of ideology in collaboration. “In France, we have long thought that collaboration wasn’t an ideological commitment — we believed that collaborators were crooks,” Mr. Bruttmann said. “But there were also French Nazis.” The show also demonstrates how that ideology was evident in France’s everyday life through the press, literature and art. There are newspaper covers, books, letters, posters and cartoons denouncing Jews, Communists and Freemasons. Posters from successful exhibitions, including one called “Bolshevism Against Europe” and presented at the Salle Wagram, an auditorium in central Paris then in its heyday, are also on display, as is a re-creation of the front widow of the Librairie Rive Gauche, the Left Bank bookstore that sold the best sellers of collaboration at the time, including the “Little Anti-Jewish Catechism,” by Adrien de Boisandré, from decades earlier. Many of the documents show the extent of German censorship. They include a list drawn up by the Germans of 1,060 books by anti-Nazi, Anglophile or Jewish authors targeted for destruction. “Collaboration 1940-1945” has prompted conferences, debates, film screenings and workshops on wartime France and on Vichy’s anti-Semitic policies. Among these events is a workshop for children to study posters from the era — “the symbols, colors and graphic techniques of propaganda,” in the words of the National Archives website. The workshop, the website says, is aimed at encouraging children “to examine the questions of legitimacy of power and ‘disobedience.’ ”
