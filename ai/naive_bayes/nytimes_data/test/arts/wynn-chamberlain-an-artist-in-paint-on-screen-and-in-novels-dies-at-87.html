Wynn Chamberlain, an Artist in Paint, on Screen and in Novels, Dies at 87
Mr. Chamberlain, whose friends included the poet Allen Ginsberg and the pop artist Andy Warhol, was also an author and a producer.

In 1965, long before the Bowery in Lower Manhattan had begun its gentrifying ascent, the painter Wynn Chamberlain had a studio at 222, a building that now has a Green Depot store on the ground floor but was then in a derelict neighborhood, with a mission across the street. On the evening of April 22, a Thursday, however, it became the center of hip, artsy New York when Mr. Chamberlain, who was best known at the time for painting poets in the nude, hosted a literary gathering that featured a reading by William S. Burroughs, the author of “Naked Lunch.” The crowd of 130 people — including the pop artist  Mr. Chamberlain, who was a pal of the poet Allen Ginsberg and the avant-garde composer John Cage as well as a member of the Warhol cohort, was clearly at home in a gathering of eclectic artists, perhaps because his own career in the arts was pretty eclectic. In addition to painting, he produced an early play by the satirist playwright Charles Ludlam; he made a movie, “Brand X,” that some consider an underground classic, and he wrote novels set in locations like Morocco and India, where he spent a great deal of his later life. He was 87 when he died in New Delhi on Nov. 27. His daughter, Sara, said in an email that the cause was heart failure. As a painter, Mr. Chamberlain, whose work is in the Smithsonian American Art Museum’s collection, was known early in his career for  He was briefly notorious for a series of paintings of artists and writers, including Ginsberg, without their clothes, and in particular for  Mr. Chamberlain, who sometimes used his given name, Elwyn, turned away from painting as he grew older. In 1967, he was a producer, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater in the East Village, of “Conquest of the Universe,” a frenetic collage by Mr. Ludlam dealing with the future of war and sex. (Mr. Ludlam, a priest of high camp, later became the longtime leader of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company.) And in 1969, Mr. Chamberlain made  Elwyn Moody Chamberlain was born in Minneapolis on May 19, 1927, to Lwyn Chamberlain, a stockbroker, and his wife, Nell. He began service in the United States Navy as World War II was coming to an end and subsequently earned a bachelor’s degree in English from the University of Idaho and master’s degrees in philosophy and art history from the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Mr. Chamberlain had his first solo show as a painter in 1951, in Milwaukee; his first show in New York, at the Edwin Hewitt Gallery, in 1954, was attended by Warhol, who was then a commercial artist, and the two became friends. Besides his daughter, Sara, and her twin brother, Sam, Mr. Chamberlain is survived by his wife, the former Sally Stokes, whom he married in 1965. The family first moved to India in 1970, and in 1972 Mr. Chamberlain and his wife sold their house in Staatsburg, N.Y., in Dutchess County. Returning to remove belongings from a barn on the property, Mr. Chamberlain examined his paintings, decided he did not like them and burned them. The family later lived in California, Mexico and Morocco before returning to India this year. Mr. Chamberlain’s first novel, “Gates of Fire,” a story of Americans smuggling LSD into India, was published in 1978. His other novels include “Then Spoke the Thunder” (1989), an adventure tale also set in India, and “Paradise,” set in Marrakesh, Morocco; it was published  The first public screening of “Brand X” in 40 years took place in 2011 at the New Museum on the Bowery, across the street from the site of Mr. Chamberlain’s 1965 soiree. It was more than a coincidence; the film was shot largely in the vicinity. “It’s an opportunity to look at the neighborhood — how it was,” Ethan Swan, who works with the museum’s archive of neighborhood artists and who organized the screening, told The Times at the time. “There was this creative richness that came from a really interesting combination of cheap rent and minimal police presence. There was nobody saying: ‘You can’t weld on the sidewalk.’ ‘You can’t live in a loft.’ It allowed for so much to happen.”
