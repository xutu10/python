Jonah Bokaer’s ‘October 7, 1944’ at Center for Jewish History
The choreographer Jonah Bokaer’s exhibition “October 7, 1944” pays tribute to four women who helped ignite an uprising at Auschwitz.

“What do you think of when I say ‘archive’?” asked Rachel Lithgow, the executive director of the American Jewish Historical Society. A solitary place of research, perhaps, with “big old filing cabinets with dusty paper and some person with granny glasses?” she suggested. Certainly not the site of a new commission centered on that least sedentary, most physically alive of art forms: dance. Yet through Dec. 30, visitors to the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan (where the society is housed) will see just that, in “October 7, 1944,” an exhibition by the choreographer  Mr. Bokaer said he initially had reservations about the project. “A lot of questions for myself about: Do dance and choreography have the criteria to represent those events?” he said recently over lunch in Hudson, N.Y., where he was rehearsing his dancers. In 2012, Ms. Lithgow saw a dance-on-film work of Mr. Bokaer’s, “Study for Occupant,” in Philadelphia that prompted her to contact him. “Jonah is avant-garde in many ways,” she said. “But I was really compelled to stare at the screen, at these four women” in the film. Other colleagues asked Mr. Bokaer if the piece was meant to be a reference to European women’s history or  Mr. Bokaer, 33, began a conversation with Ms. Lithgow. She described the chain of events that started in spring 1943, when three Polish Jews assigned to work in a munitions factory just outside the Auschwitz death camp — Estera Wajcblum, Regina Szafirsztajn and Ala Gertner — were recruited by Roza Robota, who worked at the camp’s clothing depot, to smuggle gunpowder to members of the Sonderkommando (inmates with the job of moving bodies in the crematories). The powder, carried under the women’s fingernails, in their pockets and even on corpses, destroyed one crematory and ultimately fueled a rebellion led by Sonderkommando members on Oct. 7, 1944. Three SS guards were killed; the women, after months of torture (during which they refused to give up any names), were hanged in front of inmates in January 1945, three weeks before Soviet troops arrived. “If you’re a scholar of the Holocaust, you know who these four women are,” Ms. Lithgow said. “But no one else does.” She offered Mr. Bokaer a commission. Though he had not engaged so directly with historical material before, he accepted, in large part because he was struck by the quiet bravery of the women’s act. He also hoped to help set the historical record straight. “There’s a lot of very well known male writers who have written about resistance in World War II,” he said. “But almost systematically they don’t mention the women.” As both Mr. Bokaer and Ms. Lithgow noted, creating Holocaust-inspired art presents formidable challenges. “There’s very little artistic representation of the Holocaust that’s good,” Ms. Lithgow said. Trivialization is a danger, Mr. Bokaer added. “That’s part of why I was very clear from the outset to say: There will be no live element in this commission,” he said. “I felt film and documentary have a much more developed history around this.” Ms. Lithgow connected Mr. Bokaer with officials at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and State Museum, which extensively screened him. “A choreographer researching the history of Auschwitz is for us a rare situation,” Pawel Sawicki, a spokesman for the memorial, said in an email. He called the story of the four women “one of the most crucial” in the camp’s dark history and praised Mr. Bokaer’s “sensitivity and awareness.” In August, Mr. Bokaer was given access to the State Museum’s archives and to curators like Igor Bartosik, a Sonderkommando specialist who reconstructed the events of Oct. 6 and 7, 1944. To create a visual “architecture” for his work, Mr. Bokaer took a series of video shots of the grounds and the ruins of the factory where the women worked. “The strange thing is — and this is in one of the films — there were three young Polish girls there, kind of being rebellious and smoking,” he recalled of his exploration of the factory. “They saw me, and there was a moment of the sort of feeling me out — friend or foe — and then they left. It was a haunting thing to see.” Back in New York, Mr. Bokaer and Ms. Lithgow chose eight archival pieces to show in “October 7, 1944”: four from the society, and four from YIVO, the Holocaust archive, based in New York. They were able to uncover two needles in the historical haystack, both now part of the exhibition: an account of life at the camp by Szafirsztajn’s sister, and her father’s name in an Auschwitz logbook. Mr. Bokaer’s show has four main elements: the “Study for Occupant” film from 2012; a new dance on film featuring the same four female dancers, called “Four Women,” and focused on the performers’ gestural hand movements; the videos from his trip to Auschwitz; and the eight archival documents, displayed “inside a musical envelope.” Each document is shown with part of a violin (deconstructed eight times, from the full instrument down to one string) and a segment of sheet music, handwritten by Mr. Bokaer, of the Bach  Mr. Bokaer envisions the exhibition as a lens through which to contemplate and honor the women’s actions. “This is not women throwing grenades at the crematorium,” he said. “It’s not melodrama. The women didn’t revolt. The women are the reason the revolt was possible, and the women were punished. The tragedy, for me, is that this happened only 21 days before liberation.”
