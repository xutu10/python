Guillaume Bart’s ‘La Source,’ From Paris Opera Ballet
A new version of the 1866 ballet “La Source” is running at Palais Garnier.
===
PARIS —  A beautiful water sprite falls in love with a mortal man, but that love leads to her death. Spirits watch humans make a mess of things, occasionally intervening to beneficent effect. A magical flower causes people to fall in love. Two women, one earthly and one spiritual, are potential mates for the mortal hero. Though aspects of these story lines are in the ballets “Ondine,” “La Sylphide,” “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” and “La Bayadère,” they are all found in “La Source,” an almost-forgotten ballet by Arthur Saint-Léon that had its debut at the Paris Opera in 1866. Few traces — apart from the libretto, by Saint-Léon and Charles Nuitter, and the score, by Ludwig Minkus and Léo Delibes — remain of “La Source.” But in 2011, Jean-Guillaume Bart created a version for the Paris Opera Ballet; it’s now running at the Palais Garnier while Rudolf Nureyev’s  It is a testament to the company’s strength (and size) that it can field two full-length ballets simultaneously. The double engagement also means new opportunities for a significant number of younger dancers. At Sunday’s performance, not one étoile — the company’s highest ranking for dancers — was among the principals, and the central role of Naïla was danced by Sae Eun Park, a sujet, or soloist, who was born in South Korea and joined the company in 2012. (This is unusual; most Paris Opera dancers are French and have progressed through the school and company from a young age.) Naïla is the spirit of the spring (the “source” of the title) who falls in love with the hunter Djémil and helps him pursue the beautiful Nouredda, destined to be the bride of the Khan of Ghendjib. Like “La Bayadère,” set in a colorfully fanciful India, “La Source” is testament to the 19th-century fascination with the exotic. Here the setting is the Caucasus, the mountainous region between Europe and Asia, peopled in the ballet by Cossacks, troubadours, women in Russian doll outfits, elves, nymphs and spirits. Unlike Alexei Ratmansky’s recent  Much of this production is lovely. The music (well played, although at too slow a tempo, by the Orchestre Colonne, conducted by Koen Kessels) is often ravishing, particularly the Delibes score in most of Act II. The décor, by Éric Ruf, does not attempt realism but instead offers fragments of draped curtains and hanging ropes, suggesting a theater of the imagination for these unlikely and fantastical events. Christian Lacroix’s  Mr. Bart manages the complicated story reasonably well, though at times the dramatic events make little sense. The pivotal moment when Nouredda spots the magical flower is blurred by crowd action. Her initial melancholy is mysterious, as is her later fawning behavior with the Khan (Jérémy-Loup Quer). And why does Djémil (Audric Bezard) suddenly perform a big, presentational solo near the end of Act I? These kinds of anomalies could be explained as simply the conventions of 19th-century ballet, where realism is hardly a priority. But since Mr. Bart has reworked the story and context anyway, why not get these right? Ms. Grinsztajn and Mr. Bezard danced impeccably, but they could not convince us that they cared about inhabiting their characters — and who could blame them? Djémil is a particularly dull hero who has little narrative action, except mooning after Nouredda while she dances seductively for the Khan, and behaving impassively with poor Naïla, who sacrifices herself for him. The choreography is problematic, too. It’s not bad; it’s even competent. But it’s deadly dull. Much of the dancing resembles classroom variations, with an on-the-note musicality that often makes the performers look as if they are waiting to strike a pose. Mr. Bart’s best sections are for the denizens of the otherworld, particularly for Naïla, her elf Zaël (Axel Ibot) and his elf underlings (Marc Moreau and Fabien Révillion). Zaël, a Puck-like character in a green bodysuit (his choreography quotes from Balanchine’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”), is the best male role in the ballet, and Mr. Ibot brought it to sparkling life, showing a dazzling technique and a vivid, playful stage presence. Ms. Park was equally impressive, bringing a steely delicacy and aerial lightness to Naïla; she had plenty of backbone, but also the grandeur of spirit to make her martyrdom plausible. (Naïla uses the flower to bring Djémil and Nouredda together, but this means she must die. So it goes in the spirit world.) “La Source” is a fascinating exercise, a tantalizing proposition to a ballet world always in search of its holy grail: the successful full-length production, which audiences appear to crave. In Mr. Bart’s version, the ingredients are all there; the outcome is both pretty and unfortunately inconsequential.
