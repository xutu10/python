Wrapped in Complexity
The sculptures of Judith Scott, cocoonlike bundles of yarn, fabric and found objects, look perfectly on-trend.

The sculptures of Judith Scott, cocoonlike bundles of yarn, fabric and found objects, look perfectly on-trend in their devotion to fiber art and assemblage. But Ms. Scott (1943-2005) was not trying to insert herself into any particular contemporary-art conversation. She was born with Down syndrome, was largely deaf and mute, and spent 35 years in an Ohio institution. In 1987, her twin sister, Joyce, introduced her to the Creative Growth program for artists with developmental disabilities in Oakland, Calif., where she spent the rest of her life making art.
