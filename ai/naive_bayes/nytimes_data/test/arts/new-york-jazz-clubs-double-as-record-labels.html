New York Jazz Clubs Double as Record Labels
In the current music-industry climate, a lane has opened for small but serious labels with low overhead and ready-made recording space.

The saxophonist Ian Hendrickson-Smith has caught his share of deflected stardust: as a former foot soldier with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, as a hired gun for the likes of Al Green and as a member of “The Tonight Show” band (which is to say, the Roots). For the rest of this year, as part of the Loston Harris Trio, he’ll appear Thursday through Saturday nights at Bemelmans Bar, the hobnobby lounge in the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan. “Live at Smalls,” Mr. Hendrickson-Smith’s new album, belongs to a different scale of accomplishment. It’s a sturdy, uncomplicated set of vintage-style soul jazz, recorded in one of New York’s least pretentious clubs, possibly as an afterthought. If it’s a token of artistic independence, it’s a modest one. But the welcoming gleam in Mr. Hendrickson-Smith’s playing, and the assertive support of a rhythm section with David Hazeltine on piano, are worth the trouble. The album has a spark of life, a reason for being. It happens to be one of several albums out in physical form this week on SmallsLive, a record label associated with that Greenwich Village jazz haunt. And SmallsLive, in turn, is one of several notable labels to have grown out of the New York club scene. Half Note, affiliated with the Blue Note Jazz Club (but, it should be said, not Blue Note Records), has been in business for years.  These labels come out of an old impulse and a newer set of circumstances. Jazz musicians have been making albums in clubs for as long as it’s been feasible; some of the results, like Sonny Rollins’s “A Night at the Village Vanguard,” recorded in 1957, might as well be on the register of National Historic Landmarks. For historical and acoustical reasons, the Vanguard leads in this field —  Still, those are albums released on separate record labels. The perpetual challenge of running a successful jazz club, and the equally daunting proposition of starting a record label, have long conspired to keep the two businesses separate, notwithstanding the odd, fleeting exception. But in the current record industry climate, a lane has opened for small but serious labels with low overhead, ready-made recording space and built-in artist rosters and potential audiences. It’s a wonder this didn’t happen a decade ago. In the case of Half Note, it did — in a quiet, creeping fashion. Established in 1998, the label gained momentum a few years later under the direction of Jeff Levenson, a veteran label executive. Its output since has been prolific, if a little unfocused. Estimable albums by two stalwart Half Note artists, the pianist Kenny Werner and the trombonist Conrad Herwig, were released this fall. Next spring’s batch is to include one Latin-jazz album by Mr. Herwig; another by Jerry Gonzalez and the Fort Apache Band; and a saxophone summit featuring Odean Pope, Pharaoh Sanders and James Carter. SmallsLive entered the picture four years ago with an initial batch of 11 “Live at Smalls” releases, including one by Mr. Hendrickson-Smith. Like Smalls itself, the label has a soulful and scruffy identity, though its production values are mostly beyond reproach. And, like Smalls, it could be said to represent the New York jazz mainstream in microcosm, with upstart modernists like the saxophonist Will Vinson, as well as more experienced hands like Peter Bernstein, who put out a thoughtful solo guitar album this fall. Mr. Hendrickson-Smith’s new album joins a pair of new SmallsLive releases by pianists: Spike Wilner, the proprietor of Smalls, who has a playful grasp of jazz history; and Theo Hill, a painterly young player with a chamberlike approach to composition. Last year’s albums included a sharp outing by the veteran hard-bop pianist Harold Mabern, leading his trio with John Webber on bass and Joe Farnsworth on drums. Mr. Mabern and the same rhythm team also put out the inaugural release on Smoke Sessions early this year, an equally strong album titled “Right on Time.” That and the label’s next few albums, including one by Mr. Hazeltine, quickly set a tone: swinging, straight-ahead jazz, impeccably engineered in its natural habitat by one of the club’s owners, Paul Stache. The last handful of Smoke Sessions albums has been extraordinarily good, suggesting that the label has hit full stride. “The Original Mob,” a reunion of the master drummer Jimmy Cobb with several former protégés (Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Webber and the pianist Brad Mehldau), is not only Mr. Cobb’s best album in recent memory, but also a hard-bop case study, a cogent argument against obsolescence. And each of the label’s three fall releases by pianists — Cyrus Chestnut’s “Midnight Melodies,” Eric Reed’s “Groovewise” and Orrin Evans’s “Liberation Blues” — deserves a close look by anyone now in the process of assembling a year-end Top 10 list. These albums don’t sound like tossed-off byproducts of live performance; each has an arc, a sense of gravity and a suggestion of higher purpose. Naturally, the audience has a role to play here; there’s still something about a packed club that brings the best out of most jazz musicians. (It says something about the hidebound old record business that Mr. Chestnut, who spent a decade on major labels, was never given the green light to make a live album before “Midnight Melodies.”) As it happens, Smoke Sessions recorded some of next year’s releases at Sear Sound, a proper studio. The reasons have to do with a quest for audiophile sound quality — though Mr. Cobb’s album, recorded in the club with no crowd interference, might seem to suggest a more appealing compromise. Still, there’s reason to trust that the club’s spirit can survive beyond its stage. And at a moment when robustly swinging music doesn’t have many safe harbors in the record industry, news like this can only be good.
