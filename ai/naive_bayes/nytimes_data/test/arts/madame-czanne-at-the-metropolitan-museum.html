‘Madame C&eacute;zanne,’ at the Metropolitan Museum
The exhibition “Madame Cézanne” includes 24 paintings of Hortense Fiquet, Paul Cézanne’s wife, made over a 20-year period.

“Be an apple! Be an apple!” Paul Cézanne is said to have admonished his models, demanding absolute stillness and equanimity. “Do I have to tell you again you must sit like an apple?” he told a restless Ambroise Vollard, his dealer, who had fallen asleep in midpose. In the exhibition “Madame Cézanne,” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, you sense that Cézanne did not need to give such directives to his wife, otherwise known as Hortense Fiquet. With her glazed eyes and tightly glued mouth, she’s a paragon of patience, passivity and silence. Including 24 paintings made over a 20-year period, the Met’s intriguing show is the most exhaustive look yet at the woman who shared the painter’s household, bore his son and eventually became his legal spouse (despite his disapproving family) — the woman long dismissed, by the eminent Cézanne scholar John Rewald, among others, as a noninfluence. The paintings of her have long stonewalled would-be psychologists, offering few indications of intimacy or interior life. (The poet Rainer Maria Rilke, enthusing over “Madame Cézanne in a Red Armchair,” focused on the work’s color scheme and called the chair “a personality in its own right.”) But assembled at the Met, in significant quantity, they are more forthcoming. Poring over them, we slowly start to see Madame Cézanne as more person, less apple. We observe small changes of expression from painting to painting, as in two subtly differentiated versions of “Madame Cézanne in a Yellow Chair” (one from the Fondation Beyeler, the other from the Art Institute of Chicago). In one, she is wary and wide-eyed, as in a portrait by Giacometti (who is known to have made drawings after some of the Madame Cézanne paintings); in the other, she looks distant and pensive. We also notice intricacies of color, pattern and texture, for which Fiquet — who had a well-documented interest in fashion — may deserve some of the credit. Stripes, ruffles and bows enliven her high-necked ensembles. Cézanne, more than is usual in his portraits, seems to take an interest in these details and in the decorative surroundings — the diamond-motif wallpaper and brocaded chairs — of the couple’s various apartments. And in two paintings — one from 1873-74, the other from 1890 — we even see her with her hair down in one of Cézanne’s rare concessions to sensuality. Her chestnut strands stream past her shoulders, although the forelocks are tucked neatly behind her ears, and her gaze, as usual, is opaque. Organized by Dita Amory, a curator of the Met’s Robert Lehman Collection, the show unfolds mainly along two long walls of the Lehman Wing — using the paintings as a shield for the more intimate sketches tucked away in a nearby gallery. This arrangement speaks to the intense privacy of Cézanne’s domestic life; for more than a decade, he kept his relationship with Fiquet a secret from his father, fearing the cutoff of his monthly allowance. The sketches are especially revealing, and not just because of their informal execution (in graphite in Cézanne’s small sketchbooks). They experiment with less guarded poses. A luscious profile, for instance, softens the subject’s jaw with gentle half-moons of hatching and conveys a sense of total absorption; Madame may be reading or sewing or tending to the couple’s son (whose downy infant head also appears in one sheet of multiple studies). Fiquet is further humanized by the show’s catalog essays (including one by Philippe Cézanne, her great-grandson). They tell us, for instance, that the sense of stasis and permanence in the portraits is very much at odds with the peripatetic reality of the couple’s family life. Cézanne shuttled his companion and their son between homes in Paris and Aix-en-Provence, sometimes living with them and sometimes not, and this arrangement continued even after the marriage. “Madame Cézanne” also suggests new ways of thinking about Cézanne’s portraiture, which often seems to have little to do with people; it’s another kind of still life (more apples) or a modern interpretation of genre painting, along the lines of “The Card Players.” (A larger show of his portraiture is scheduled to open at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris in 2017 and to travel to the National Gallery in Washington.) It says that numbing familiarity was actually, for Cézanne, a form of intimacy; that he could connect with portrait subjects only when they were as reliable a presence in his life as Mont Sainte-Victoire. And it raises a difficult question that goes beyond the Cézannes’ unconventional relationship: Do successful artists need to be understood by their partners? By most accounts,  But she seems to have supported him in other ways, by enduring both long portrait sessions and long stretches apart. As Cézanne’s great-grandson writes, “It is likely that he would have found a less independent woman unbearable.”
