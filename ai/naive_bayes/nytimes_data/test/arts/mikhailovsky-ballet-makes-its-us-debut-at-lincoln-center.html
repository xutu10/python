Mikhailovsky Ballet Makes Its U.S. Debut at Lincoln Center
Natalia Osipova was the shining lead in the Mikhailovsky Ballet’s United States debut, “Giselle, ou les Willis,” at Lincoln Center.

The  Mr. Kekhman came to the rescue of the institution, paying for the renovation of the Mikhailovsky Theater, which opened in 1833, and raising private and corporate money to finance new productions and to lure top Russian dancers.  Now, Mikhail Messerer, a respected teacher and former Bolshoi dancer with ballet in the blood — the dancers in his family include his uncle Asaf Messerer; his mother, Sulamith Messerer; and his cousin  Nikita Dolgushin’s elegant staging of this Romantic ballet startlingly contrasts the earthy realism of the first act with the ghostly setting of the second. But it also doesn’t hurt that Ms. Osipova and Leonid Sarafanov, a scrupulous dancer with close-cropped sandy hair and a boyish face, are its leads. They are bracing artists, both for their dramatic details and prodigious technique. You may think you remember the sensation of Ms. Osipova’s ballon, the elastic quality that makes it seem as though her body is floating, until you see it again. And Mr. Sarafanov should be scooped up by American Ballet Theater. “Giselle” is a tale that unfolds in two worlds. The Mikhailovsky dispenses with the characters’ names (instead of Albrecht, Mr. Sarafanov is the Count, while the jealous Hilarion, played by Vladimir Tsal, is the Gamekeeper), but the story remains the same. In love with a man pretending to be a peasant like herself, Giselle all but ignores the heartbroken Gamekeeper. Often, this character is played to the boorish hilt, but in Mr. Tsal there’s a broken-down melancholy that even permeates his walk: hunched over, chin raised. Ms. Osipova is all light delicacy, yet focuses on the downbeat as if intentionally planting her Giselle into the earth. While traveling across the stage in hops on point, as her working leg traces circles in the air — even abandoning her diagonal path for a full rotation — her emphasis is rooted both on the floor and in reality. As the trusting Giselle, Ms. Osipova may have a weak heart but simmers with inner life, which paves the way for a chillingly quiet mad scene. Taking unsteady steps as her body pitches forward, she marks the outline of earlier movements before grabbing the Count’s sword and dragging it along the floor wildly; in a violent flash, she holds the tip to her breast, but the Gamekeeper pulls it away. She crumbles. Mr. Sarafanov’s Count, a spoiled player, also snaps into moments of realization. After a vigorous dance, he rests his ear on Ms. Osipova’s heart and peers into her eyes with equal astonishment and fear. Yet it’s not dancing that does her in, but his deceit. In the second act, she is transformed into a spectral Wili, part of a pack of women who make men dance to their deaths. Ekaterina Borchenko’s Queen of the Wilis, at first more rigid than coldly commanding as she strikes arabesque positions rather shakily, gradually becomes more believable and regal as her long, trailing arms etch the air like coiling snakes. Still, nothing is as uncanny as Ms. Osipova, whose Butoh-pale skin and eerie, unseeing eyes make it seem as though she is still whirling in the madness that consumed her in the first act. Before she was earth, now she is air. In the peasant pas de deux, Veronika Ignatyeva, opposite an efficient Andrey Yakhnyuk, holds her balances with sweet aplomb. Mikhail Mekler’s lighting gives this village scene the feel of vintage Technicolor, yet it loses dancers in strange pockets of darkness. There are some special effects in the second act: The Wilis’ veils are whisked away as if by magic, and the trees in Vyacheslav Okunev’s set rise and fall like elevators — distracting enough to look like a mistake — but at least this supernatural forest is alive. Ms. Osipova appears in a tree as though she’s levitating, and Mr. Sarafanov, later performing a stunning sequence of entrechat-sixes, mirrors her celestial aura. The Gamekeeper fights for his life and loses; Giselle saves her Count from a similar fate. But as she leaves the stage with backward bourrée steps, it is Ms. Osipova’s details, the way her arms extend with quivering, dancing fingers, which cast the deepest chill: The memory of her life on earth, now truly over, slips between them.
