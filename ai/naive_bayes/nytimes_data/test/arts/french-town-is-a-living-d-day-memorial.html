French Town Is a Living D-Day Memorial
With the Musée Airborne and other sites, Ste.-Mère-Église, a small town in Normandy, continues its reverence for a World War II battle.

STE.-MÈRE-ÉGLISE, France —  Henri-Jean Renaud remembers the night the Americans floated down from the sky. He was 10 years old in 1944, the son of the mayor of this small town on the Cotentin peninsula in Normandy. On the night of June 5, Mr. Renaud recalls, his father had been called away, because a house just off the village square had caught fire. “Maybe a half-hour later, we hear a terrible noise,” said Mr. Renaud, whose family lived over the pharmacy his father also owned and operated. It was the sound of planes, hundreds of them, flying low overhead. “We hear shouting outside, guns. My brother and I tried to look out the window. My mother said, ‘No, no!’ pulled us back and we all knelt and prayed.” Mr. Renaud, who is now 80, remembers his father returning home an hour or so later, excited. There had been rumors that the long-awaited invasion of occupied  Indeed it was, for the Renaud family, for the town of Ste.-Mère-Église, for all of France and Europe under Nazi domination. The invasion today remembered as D-Day began around midnight June 5, when elements of the U.S. 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions landed in the town, behind German lines and about six miles inland from one of the key D-Day beaches, known to the locals as La Madeleine, and remembered today by its invasion code name, Utah. (At around the same time, British airborne troops were landing farther east in Normandy.) Seventy years later, the entire 50-mile invasion area bristles with American, British and Canadian flags, D-Day-themed hotels and restaurants and an estimated 70 museums, large and small, dedicated to various aspects of the battle. And yet nowhere in Normandy is the memory of the liberation kept alive with greater reverence or passion than in this village of 1,600, strategically located along the main road to Cherbourg, 40 miles to the north. The town is the site of the Musée Airborne, which opened in 1964 and this year added a third building to its 107,000 square feet. The museum, whose two original buildings are shaped like parachutes, tells the story of the airborne assaults on D-Day, and also explains the equipment, training and manufacture of the planes and gliders in  The new building houses an “immersion experience,” in which visitors sit in a dimly lit C-47. When they walk out, glass floors and strobe lights give them a sense of what it might have been like to step into the blackness 400 feet above the town in 1944, lit only by tracers and explosions, and the flames from the house. Yet, what’s most striking to an American visitor is how the entire town of Ste.-Mère-Église seems to be a living museum. The town is a tribute to the liberators, stretching out beyond the grounds of the museum to the nearby town square and the medieval Sancte Marie Ecclesia (Church of St. Mary), now a shrine to the paratroopers and open to the public. The streets are also part of it, many now named after American officers and men who played some role in the invasion. Historical markers displaying the Airborne patches of the American units abound. The center of town was the scene of a fierce firefight, as many paratroopers ended up landing in the village square. The parachute of one soldier from North Carolina, named John Steele, was ensnared in the steeple of the church. He hung helpless as the battle raged in the streets below him, a scene memorably depicted in the 1962 film “The Longest Day” (the actor Red Buttons played Mr. Steele). He was then briefly taken prisoner by the Germans before escaping. At 4:30 a.m. — while the Renauds, who had retreated from their house on the square, hid in a nearby ditch with other terrified civilians — the Stars and Stripes was hoisted over Ste.-Mère-Église, making it the first town liberated in the invasion of Europe. Today, an effigy of Steele continues to hang on the church steeple (the real Steele, by then in his 50s, returned for the grand opening of the museum in 1964). Inside the church are two stained-glass memorial windows. One, depicting the Virgin Mary holding the infant Jesus, flanked by two paratroopers descending from above, underscores the almost sacred status the Americans have in this town. “I was stunned,” said Cathy Soref of Locust Valley, N.Y., who first visited Ste.-Mère-Église in 2006 as part of a continuing cultural exchange and education program between the two communities called Operation Democracy. “They will never forget their heroes.” Ms. Soref is now working with the village, the French government and United States supporters on the idea of creating a Colonial Williamsburg-type living history museum there, devoted to the war period. “In Ste.-Mère-Église, links which were created in 1944 still exist now,” says Claire Lesourd, a licensed Normandy guide, who frequently brings tourists to the town as part of her D-Day tours. “In this village, it looks like the past has passed from the generation of the parents of the 1940s to the children.” As they were on the night of the invasion, the Renaud family is still at the heart of it. Henri-Jean is on the board of the Airborne Museum; his brother Maurice is the head of the Association des Amis des Vétérans Américains (the Association of Friends of American Veterans), a fraternal organization that maintains close ties with the dwindling number of D-Day participants and their families. Another brother, Paul, drew the stained-glass memorials in the church. And their mother, Simone Renaud, became known as the Mother of Normandy, for her efforts in tending the graves of American soldiers temporarily buried in the town. Maurice Renaud says that what really helped cement the bond between the town and the troops was the oft-overlooked fact that for two days after the liberation of Ste.-Mère-Église the Germans tried to retake it. Their counteroffensive was held off by a few hundred paratroopers until reinforcements from Utah Beach arrived. “If the Germans had succeeded, they would have destroyed the whole town and killed everybody,” Mr. Renaud says. “Thank God, these guys succeeded in stopping them. The feeling of the people here is so strong because of that.”
