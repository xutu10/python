A Feast of ‘Killer Shoes’ at the Brooklyn Museum
“Killer Heels,” a sweeping exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, drives home the notion that shoes are one of visual culture’s most freighted artifacts.
===
For me, the high point of the recent Emmy Awards broadcast was the sight of Sarah Silverman gathering up the voluminous skirts of her  After the obligatory red-carpet mentions of haute couture designers, and the sight of stars teetering about on extreme footwear, the apparently unscripted sprint briefly lightened the inevitable grip of the luxury-celebrity complex on events like this. It was also a great way to speed up the show, which was dragging. When the going gets urgent, elegantly impractical if not torturous heels get left behind. With so many long gowns, these vertiginous accessories had been mostly invisible anyway. The memory of Ms. Silverman’s athleticism provides an inspiring real-world balance to the aura of immobility, fetish and fantasy that suffuses “ Whether you view extra-high heels with lust or horror, as objects of empowerment or objectification, “Killer Heels” is among the most gorgeous and meticulously organized shows mounted by the Brooklyn Museum in some years. Helpfully, it provides quantities of fodder for both sides of the argument, if not always by intention. Shoes are among visual culture’s most freighted artifacts. Ranging in origin from the late Renaissance to now, from the East and West, with platform soles included along with the rickety heels, every shoe here quickly floods the mind with suggestions of bodies, postures, garments, manners and various forms of intercourse. It almost doesn’t matter where or when it comes from, or whether we covet it or stare in revulsion. From my angle, standing flat on the ground with foot issues that prohibit heels of any height, the show is best taken as a display of extraordinarily abstract yet deliriously resonant sculptures thinly disguised as luxury footwear. They involve undeniable feats (sorry) of imagination and craft by men and some women who are viewed as something close to artists serving the .001 percent. Produced by the likes of Prada and Miu Miu (the most flamboyant), Christian Louboutin (the kinkiest) and Roger Vivier (the most farsighted) as well as unfamiliar names past and present, each of these “sculptures” is also a Pandora’s box of meanings and implications: cultural, historical, sexual, physical, economic. It’s rare to see an exhibition in which the objects speak so clearly and complexly for themselves. Meticulously assembled by Lisa Small, the museum’s curator of exhibitions, the show is a labor of love and erudition. Its nearly 160 pairs of shoes are divided into six fairly coherent sections sprinkled with other design objects, from furniture to porcelain teacups; videos, both explanatory and commissioned from artists by the museum; and film clips. There is, of course, a “Glamour and Fetish” section, but also less expected ones like “Rising From the East,” which reminds us of how many foot-related innovations the West owes to the non-West. These include the platform slide, which may have originated in the Roman baths but also evolved in different parts of Asia, in many cases to keep feet dry. A stark post-and-lintel version in wood and mother-of-pearl from early-20th-century Syria would be challenging to negotiate regardless of what’s underfoot. No chapter is less than visually riveting. Beautiful colors, exotic materials and stunning craftsmanship abound, and Ms. Small’s extended labels add useful facts and observations. (The label for Aoi Kotsuhiroi’s 2013 towering red lacquer ’Forbbiden Color" platforms alerts us that the heels are animal horns.) In “Glamour and Fetish,” she points out that the miniskirts of the 1960s brought thigh-high boots out of the dominatrix’s closet and into the mainstream and presents three examples from the early 20th century to the present. This range underscores a point made most resoundingly in “Revival and Reinterpretation,” the opening section, which stresses the constant recycling of conventions and forms through time and cultures. Thus T-strap lizard pumps from the late 1920s by Morris Wolock are perfectly in accord with today’s fashions, as are the black high-heeled dinner oxfords (1900-10) designed by Charles Strohbeck. Yet the Munster platform shoes from 1994 by John Fluevog — which exaggerate the thick heel, square toe and buckle of the Pilgrim shoe — looks hopelessly dated. A backless chopine from 17th-century Venice is an early instance of the cantilevered off-the-ground heel that crops up throughout the show, finding its most extreme expression in Noritaka Tatehana’s nearly vertical Atom bootie of 2012-13. The needle all but popped off my disbelief gauge at the sight of heels designed by Iris Schieferstein, part of the “Metamorphosis” section. This part also includes the tiny pointed silk envelopes made to sheath a woman’s bound feet in 19th-century China, and the 2012 “Healing Fukushima ( This section is rife with surreal animal references, but Ms. Schieferstein opts for the real thing: the toes of her shoes are hollowed-out horses’ hooves including fetlock hair. Also stressing the gauge are Mr. Louboutin’s 2007 eight-inch-high leather “pumps” whose stilettos force the wearer’s feet into the en pointe position of a ballerina. We see them worn (sort of) in a large photograph taken by David Lynch, the wearer’s legs impossibly curved like Jessica Rabbit’s. Nearby, a short film clip by Irving Klaw from the 1950s shows Bettie Page donning stockings and garter to hobble briefly about in shoes nearly as steep. The show’s videos are in the main short and appropriate, if not uniformly excellent. In the tiny opening galleries are four that demonstrate the marvels of current shoe technology to engrossing effect. On one side, we see stilettos being made by hand by Italian cobblers for Salvatore Ferragamo and Giuseppe Zanotti. On the other, we see demonstrations of 3-D printing and other of-the-moment processes for a Zaha Hadid design that resembles a discombobulated silver Slinky, and a tangled-root design by Iris van Herpen and United Nude. The latter shoe is indebted to Alexander McQueen’s clublike Armadillo shoes of 2009, popularized by Lady Gaga and oddly absent. For one of the commissioned videos, the fashion photographer Steven Klein records the gorgeous legs of a model shod in red patent-leather-and-metal stilettos furiously scratching the hood of a red automobile, drawing the obvious connection between cars and shoes as objects of desire. Nick Knight provides a blurry meditation on a stiletto glass slipper inhabited by the unmanicured feet of someone of uncertain gender, with lots of heavy breathing. Marilyn Minter shows a pair of hefty feet — heavily manicured, but not actually male — stomping through silver paint in platform sandals laden with jewels and charms. These and a clip of Jack Lemmon struggling with modest pumps in “Some Like It Hot” are about the only hints of drag, a theme whose omission is one of the show’s few shortcomings. A more immediate problem is the prevalence of dim lighting, probably dictated by the fragility of textiles and leather, the dominant materials for the shoes’ uppers. This can have an unfortunate melodramatic effect, and makes many details maddeningly difficult if not impossible to see. The murkiness may drive up sales of the catalog, which pictures just about all the shoes in sharp focus against a white ground. You’ll be astonished by how much you’ve missed, but then, there is no end to the strange, essential art of footwear, as proved by the walkable feast that is this finely wrought show.
