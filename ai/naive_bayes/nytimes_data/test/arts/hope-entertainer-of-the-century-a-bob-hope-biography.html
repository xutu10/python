‘Hope: Entertainer of the Century,’ a Bob Hope Biography
Richard Zoglin’s new biography, “Hope: Entertainer of the Century,” follows Bob Hope through vaudeville days, Hollywood films, the Oscars, the U.S.O. tours and seeming irrelevance.

Richard Zoglin’s revelatory new biography of Bob Hope makes staggering claims for its subject. Is it enough to say that “for the way he marketed himself, managed his celebrity, cultivated his brand and converted his show business fame into a larger, more consequential role for himself on the public stage, Bob Hope was the most important entertainer of the century”? No, it’s not. Mr. Zoglin adds that “one could argue, without too much exaggeration, that he was the  This unabashedly ambitious book also makes much of Hope as inspiration, public citizen and inventor of the stand-up comedy monologue, the kind he delivered when hosting the Academy Awards, which he did more than anyone else has. “No one ever looked better in a tuxedo,” Mr. Zoglin hyperbolizes about that. Why, then, is Mr. Hope so seldom thanked for all he contributed to American life? Why do stand-up comics forget to mention him as the great pioneer? Lenny Bruce, whose name is as acceptable for them to drop as Hope’s is not, once supposedly spotted Hope in his audience and followed him into the parking lot, asking Hope to put him on NBC. Hope thought Bruce brilliant, but he knew how to deflect him. “Lenny,” he said, according to The San Diego Union, “you’re for educational TV.” How did Hope start in vaudeville, entertain his way through the changing show business styles of the 20th century, become all-powerful and then ignored? It’s a great, forgotten story, and Mr. Zoglin provides a definitive version. Sure, it’s hyperbolic at times, and even defensive about Hope’s bad judgment once it starts to torpedo him. But Mr. Zoglin sees a great, gifted performer who gave the world endless amounts of hilarity, generosity and showbiz savvy. And it seems to pain him viscerally when Hope casts a shadow over his own achievements. This book is so enveloping that it’s hard not to share some of that pain. Born in 1903 in Eltham, southeast of London, Hope spent his first four and a half years in England and grew up, as Leslie Towns Hope, to be the most troublesome of his mother’s six sons. After the family emigrated to the United States and settled in Cleveland, he wound up in reform school, which was not part of his official studio biography once he became famous. The first talent he displayed was a gift for dancing. By 21, he had a job in a vaudeville show called “Jolly Follies,” where he began performing with a male partner and introducing jokes and wisecracks into their acts. He was handsome and debonair enough to make a smooth segue to Broadway when vaudeville began to die. Then, after a long apprenticeship and the start of a lifelong habit of catting around with women, came stardom and also  Hope moved from radio to movies to television. He made an immensely popular string of road movies with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, beginning with  When Hope began making his tireless U.S.O. tours to entertain homesick soldiers overseas in World War II, he took along the right cheesecake co-stars, sang the songs the soldiers wanted to hear and raised their morale, even if he sometimes made them weep. He had endless topical verses, tailoring the lyrics for individual audiences, whenever he sang  His own personal war effort may have been the high point of his life. When he wasn’t overseas, he was rallying crowds at home to buy war bonds and otherwise make sacrifices for the cause. (He continued to entertain troops through the Persian Gulf war.) Although he had much in common with his fellow Midwestern comic Johnny Carson — detachment, coldness, a taste for sudden cruelty — he did not have Carson’s selfishness. He showed up where he was needed. He wrote touchingly to fans. The book includes a beautiful, never maudlin letter he sent to a dying child. If he had ended his career before Vietnam he would have been a beloved American hero. But Hope lived past his How could nostalgists miss him when he wouldn’t go away? Every big birthday meant a stiff, codgery NBC tribute to Bob Hope. Talented young performers didn’t want to be seen on these things, and more and more of his contemporaries were ailing or dead. Movie art houses declined to give Bob Hope films the treatment they gave the Marx Brothers, although Mr. Zoglin’s book may help correct that oversight. And his family members remain involved in trying to burnish his legacy and bring back the best of what he achieved. Mr. Zoglin’s fascinating book is a big contribution to their cause.
