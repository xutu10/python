Spooky Black and thestand4rd Perform at S.O.B.’s
Spooky Black and his Minnesota-based band, thestand4rd, played their first New York club date on Sunday at S.O.B.’s.

The bonus track on “Leaving,” the most recent EP by the angelic ghost-soul singer Spooky Black, is called “DJ Khaled Is My Father.” It’s typical of this young singer’s output — mournful and woozy and glancingly erotic. Needless to say, there’s no apparent connection between the song and DJ Khaled, mainstream hip-hop’s exulter-in-chief. The title’s not a joke, per se, but sort of an absurdist wink. And yet, with the Internet, anything is possible. A couple of weeks ago, there was DJ Khaled on Instagram, teasing the release of the new album from Spooky Black’s crew, thestand4rd. And there DJ Khaled was again on Sunday night at S.O.B.’s — not one but two “We the Best” chains dangling from his neck — onstage pumping up crowd members before thestand4rd’s first New York show, leading them in a chant of his hit “All I Do Is Win.” So, sure, when thestand4rd took the stage, Spooky Black first performed “DJ Khaled Is My Father,” singing with a sad face while the producer Psymun played spare, plangent guitar. But that was the only nod to the night’s maximalist guest. Instead, Spooky Black and the rest of the band — Allan Kingdom, Bobby Raps, Psymun — performed a set that toggled between reverent church hymnal and intense backpack-rap show, drawing from their solo projects and their new self-titled group album, which was recorded with Doc McKinney, one of the producers who helped shape the narcotic sound of the  That was one of the tensions on display here — of the group, which hails from St. Paul, Spooky Black is the best known and has the most distinct style. He’s a careful soul singer, preferring restraint to pulp. Sometimes he has the sass of post-New Jack Swing R&B; of the mid-1990s, sometimes he channels the isolation of Depeche Mode’s Dave Gahan, and at his most free, he veers toward pure art song, à la Antony Hegarty. He is a beautifully formless singer — not a naïf but a shy wolf. And his aesthetic is highly refined. In the video for  Here he was dressed plainly (let’s just start a run on Eckblad Trucking T-shirts now) and seemed only halfway comfortable with all the attention. That his first performance in New York wasn’t a solo one but rather as part of thestand4rd, was telling: It was a way to spread his success around and also to deflect some attention away from himself. (Not all the attention — sprinkled throughout the venue, and working the merchandise booth, were a dozen or so of his family members, all wearing T-shirts with his face on them.) At his best, as on “Without U” and “Personal Touch,” he rebuilds R&B; with Styrofoam and dry ice, making it porous and apparition-like. It’s fascinating, tactile stuff. The rest of thestand4rd complements Spooky Black’s minimal style. Allan Kingdom is a nimble, dense rapper with an ear for melody, and Bobby Raps is a bruiser in the body of a high school football nose tackle, who raps forcefully and with an occasional dash of the anxiety-rap that’s suffused the Twin Cities underground all the way back to Slug of Atmosphere. Psymun is a producer given to the foggy and the ethereal. Together, they were often thrilling, varying speeds and approaches. Even though their styles are varied, they were extremely simpatico onstage — silent when Spooky Black was clutching his microphone and delivering one of his hushed come-ons, and boisterous when Bobby Raps was barking out tightly-wrapped verses. You couldn’t help but wonder, though, what a solo Spooky Black show might be like — maybe he’d have dramatic lighting that did the visible emoting for him, or maybe he wouldn’t even look at the crowd at all. Or maybe he’s just a regular teenager who’d do regular teenage things: “Let me give a shout out to the tweens in the building,” he said midset here. (The show was all ages.) At the end of the night, after an extended encore, he disappeared from the stage, not even returning when DJ Khaled shrieked his name. The night wasn’t over, though. He later tweeted, in succession, a picture of himself, eyes droopy and with an arm around DJ Khaled; a link to listen to thestand4rd’s album; a simple “lol”; and then a picture of himself, clutching Psymun (who originally posted it) and another friend with the caption “thank u ny I love everyone so much that I want 2 die.”
