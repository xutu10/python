Cecilia Bartoli’s Album Explores Early Opera in Russia
In her new album, Cecilia Bartoli, the Italian mezzo-soprano, presents the premiere recordings of 10 arias and a choral scene written for a succession of Russian empresses in the 18th century.

“So what’s next, Cecilia?” “Well, I thought I’d record some Russian Baroque opera arias.” “Russian? Baroque? I’m not sure I heard you right. Did you say, ‘opera’? ”   It’s fun to imagine the reaction of record-company executives when  This month, Ms. Bartoli embarked on a European concert tour to promote “St. Petersburg,” a Decca CD containing the world premiere recordings of 10 arias and one choral scene written for a succession of empresses — Anna, Elizabeth and Catherine the Great — who ruled and transformed Russia in the 18th century. Most are sung in Italian; two in Russian. The composers include one German, Hermann Raupach, among a list of Italians: Francesco Domenico Araia, Vincenzo Manfredini, Domenico Dall’Oglio and Domenico Cimarosa. With the exception of the last, they are virtually unknown. On the map of recorded European opera history, this is terra incognita. In a telephone interview, Ms. Bartoli said that as most music students were, she had been taught that Russian opera began in 1836 with Glinka’s “A Life for the Czar.” But as she began to delve into Italian Baroque vocal music, she found repeated mentions of composers who had spent time at the court of St. Petersburg as long as 100 years before Glinka. “I thought, ‘Oops, why did all these people go there?’ ” Ms. Bartoli said. “It turned out they were invited by the Czarinas of the time. I thought: ‘This is interesting. I’d love to look into the music.’ ” That turned out more difficult than expected. The manuscript scores of the operas written for the empresses were tucked away inside the archives of the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg. It took Ms. Bartoli several attempts and the intercession of Valery Gergiev, the conductor who is the general and artistic director of the Mariinsky, to gain access. Averse to flying, she traveled by rail or water; for one visit in 2012, she crossed the Baltic Sea on an icebreaker. “Finally, I was able to go into the archives,” she said. “And I found jewels. Beautiful music.” It’s also music that plays to Ms. Bartoli’s strengths. Accompanied by the characterful and energetic period-instrument ensemble  But why was Ms. Bartoli the first to record this repertory? The neglect by performers is due to the scarcity of published sources and performing editions, itself the result of the ambivalence shown to this period by Russian and Soviet historians. According to Inna Naroditskaya, a professor of music at Northwestern University, dual anxieties regarding the influence of foreigners and the power of women informed their judgments. These are operas that were commissioned from foreigners by female rulers who all had one foot in the West: Anna had spent formative years  at the court of Courland (in modern-day Latvia); Elizabeth was part German; Catherine was born German, and a Lutheran. Together, they fostered an artistic and cultural ferment that was also in every respect an extension of their statecraft. “It was a show for the world that it was a very powerful and westernized country,” Ms. Naroditskaya said in a phone interview. But as a music student in the Soviet Union, she said, she learned nothing of the blossoming of Italian music in 18th-century Russia: “At best it was considered as a mimicry of Western fashion that was not worthy of attention.” Marina Ritzarev, a professor of music at Bar-Ilan University in Israel and the author of a book on 18th-century Russian music, said that the Russian approach to history was not that different from that in Britain. There, too, “there were many foreign maestros — Italian, German, Czech — active in the 18th century,” she said. “And usually, national historiography was more preoccupied with national composers, or with stars like Handel. And generally the interest in opera seria  — beyond Mozart — was quite low.” Ms. Naroditskaya is the author of “Bewitching Russian Opera: The Tsarina From State to Stage,” in which she explores the relation between power and music theater. One case study is the coronation of Elizabeth in Moscow in 1742. Part of the festivities was a presentation of Hasse’s “La Clemenza di Tito.” On Ms. Bartoli’s CD, she performs an aria from a two-act prologue that the scholar Jacob von Staehlin wrote for the work, and which was set to music by Dall’Oglio and Luigi Madonis. In it, a character representing Russia invokes the suffering of her children and celebrates the beneficence of Astrée, a ruler descending from above. The same singer, Caterina Giorgi, performed the part of Rutenia (Russia) in the prologue and Tito, the Roman emperor, in the opera, fusing past and present, Russia and Rome into one. According to Ms. Naroditskaya, the audience of  5,000 was treated to the spectacle of a four-part choir with each part representing a continent — Asia, Africa, Europe and America — exulting Elizabeth as the Tito of the day. “Here you have the very character of absolutism,” she said. “Everything begins and ends with her.” The first Italian opera troupe went to Russia in 1730 at the invitation of  After that, operas were performed regularly at imperial birthdays and coronation anniversaries. Elizabeth’s reign saw the first performance of an opera sung in Russian, Araia’s “Tsefal I Prokris” (“Cephalus and Procris”), with a libretto by the Russian poet Alexander Sumarokov. The work earned its composer a valuable sable coat and 500 rubles. Raupach, a German harpsichordist who succeeded Araia as court composer, joined forces with Sumarokov on a Russian-language opera treatment of Euripides’ “Alcestis” that was first performed in 1758 at the summer residence of Peterhof. Typically, these opera productions brought together Italian singers, set painters and stage technicians; German instrumentalists; and an ensemble of Russian dancers, complemented by a few French soloists. The audience was made up of Russian nobles and foreign diplomats. Whether there is anything tailored to Russian tastes in the music itself is a matter of debate. For the most part, the works on Ms. Bartoli’s album represent the standardized affects of opera seria: vocal pyrotechnics in arias of rage and defiance; noble legato lines for expressions of selfless love and sacrifice; obbligato flutes and oboes for pastoral settings. But Ms. Bartoli said she found some of the slow arias to be “closer to the Russian soul” than the typical Italian Baroque aria. “I found lots of slow arias and deep and nostalgic pieces, which I didn’t really expect,” she said. “I didn’t expect these harmonies from Neapolitan composers. I think the Italian composers realized the Russians were looking for nostalgic music: beautiful, slow, deep melancholic arias.” The composers themselves left few records. Their stars often rose and fell with that of their patrons: Araia’s close relationship with Grand Duke Peter spelled an end to his Russian adventure when Catherine seized power, and Peter was assassinated. Raupach, too, was discarded, as Catherine set about hiring a composer of international stature. She eventually found one in Baldassare Galuppi and exerted diplomatic pressure on the Venetian Senate to release him from his contract at St. Mark’s. But Ms. Ritzarev said that the 18th century saw such an overproduction of Italian opera composers that many gratefully seized any offer for court employment, no matter its political or meteorological climate. “Any opportunity was blessed,” she said. “And Russians paid generously.” Ms. Bartoli said she was aware that her new album is coming out during a new ice age in relations between Russia and the West. As it beams a spotlight on a time of cultural blossoming and the corresponding crisscrossing of literary and artistic influences, it’s a reminder of the interconnectivity of European history. “I’m really happy that this project is coming out now, because it’s a message of peace, and tolerance,” she said. “It’s about the exchange of cultures.”
