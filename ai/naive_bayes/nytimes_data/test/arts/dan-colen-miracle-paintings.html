Dan Colen: ‘Miracle Paintings’
Mr. Colen has dialed back the artistic swagger endemic to his 2010 debut with the Gagosian Gallery.

Dan Colen has dialed back the artistic swagger endemic to his 2010 debut with the Gagosian Gallery. He’s sized down the gallery’s big box space by about two-thirds — which should become a trend. Gone is the heavily ironic stance. Ditto the huge paintings festooned with swaths of chewing gum in lieu of brush strokes; trompe l’oeil canvases seemingly drizzled with confetti that conjure 1970s Lyrical Abstraction; and ostentatious ready-mades, including an inverted halfpipe and customized motorcycles tipped over like dominoes. Instead, Mr. Colen has confined himself to oil paint occasionally paired with dry pigment on relatively modest canvases. Irony is now obscured by a veneer of sincerity that can seem almost apologetic. The nine paintings suggest dilutions of quasi-abstract, expressionistic, visionary styles by a painter long dead and best forgotten. Among their generic illusions are cataclysms of light, watery darknesses, a trail of sparkles worthy of Tinker Bell and a red-on-red orb so dry with pigment it looks like velvet. The Tinker Bell analogy is a giveaway, as are the old-chestnut music titles: “Ride of the Valkyries” is an aqueous murk of blue-green with three wispy figures — more evocative of Rhinemaidens, but never mind. A barely discernible back story confirms that the resemblance to generic emo-painting is intentionally superficial. These efforts are fairly precise adaptations of stills from different portions of Walt Disney’s 1940 musical animation “Fantasia” and mostly take the names of their music accompaniment. (The red sun is titled “Rite of Spring” after Stravinsky.) At best, they’re transitional indications that Mr. Colen is trying to reduce the role of vacuous skill and visual punning in his art and has more work to do. At worst, they’re forming a cautionary tale about young talent eaten alive by a multinational gallery, even while whistling all the way to the bank. Could be both.
