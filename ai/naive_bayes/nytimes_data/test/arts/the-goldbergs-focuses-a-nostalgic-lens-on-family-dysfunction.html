‘The Goldbergs’ Focuses a Nostalgic Lens on Family Dysfunction
In its second season on ABC, “The Goldbergs” has built a solid following and improved ratings by adhering to a formula now scarce on TV.

CULVER CITY, Calif. —  Sitting in his office, Adam F. Goldberg, creator of the ABC sitcom “The Goldbergs,” had the impish grin of a kid in a toy store. Mostly because Mr. Goldberg’s office, on the Sony Pictures lot here, is filled, corner to corner, with toys. “The Transformers are all over here,” he said, giving a tour recently. “These are all Many of the toys date to Mr. Goldberg’s childhood in suburban Philadelphia in the 1980s, as does his TV series, a family show set in “1980-something.” It’s stuffed with that decade’s pop culture detritus — Reebok Pumps, Garbage Pail Kids, Atari — and its power ballads, like Toto’s “Africa.” “This is truly why ‘The Goldbergs’ works,” said Doug Robinson, an executive producer, as Mr. Goldberg showed off a pricey Japanese robot that his wife bought him when his childhood original broke. “This is the stuff that he’s passionate about. All the things he had growing up are just reflected in the show.” In its second season, “The Goldbergs” has built a solid following — and increasing ratings — by adhering to a formula now little seen on TV. It’s not a talk-to-the-camera mockumentary (à la “Modern Family,” which follows “The Goldbergs” on Wednesday nights), a reality-show spoof or an arch, cynical comedy. Instead, it’s a proud throwback built on nostalgia — for the era and for the sitcom tradition. Mr. Goldberg cites the “The Wonder Years” as an inspiration, and his own family as the model: Each episode ends with some home video of the real Goldberg clan, circa 1980-something, when young Adam obsessively videotaped everything. “We got one of the first cameras,” Mr. Goldberg, 38, said. By 7, he was making movies with his friends. He used his camera as a diary, and recorded fights between his older brothers, Barry and Eric. His mother, Beverly, saved hundreds of cassettes: endless source material. After Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Robinson’s last show, the hacker comedy “Breaking In,” ended, they shopped “The Goldbergs” with a home video reel. “What sold me on it was the footage of this family screaming at each other over Thanksgiving dinner,” said Wendi McLendon-Covey, who plays Beverly, scripted as a classic overbearing “smother.” “I thought, ‘This is gold.’ ” The series has softened from Mr. Goldberg’s original vision, an exposé of his dysfunctional family. Now, most episodes close with a hug and a lesson learned. “This isn’t edgy,” Mr. Goldberg said. For him, it functions as wish fulfillment, a way to relive childhood but with the closure — and the toys — he always wanted. Sean Giambrone plays 11-year-old Adam as a nerd in the days before that could confer of social cool. (Patton Oswalt narrates as the adult Adam, looking back.) Eric has become Erica (Hayley Orrantia), while Barry (Troy Gentile) retains his luggish adolescent charms. George Segal is the grandfather, Pops, a martini-guzzling ladies’ man; and the comedian Jeff Garlin is the father, Murray, emotionally remote and shouty but working on it. Mr. Garlin, who had fond memories of the ’80s (“I graduated from high school, I left home, I became a comedian, I lost my virginity. It was an exciting time for me.”), said he likes that the show appeals to several generations, but he admitted that the rapid pacing is not his style. “I’m very proud of the show, but I actually don’t watch it,” he said in a phone interview. A pause. “My wife just walked by me, and she heard me say I don’t watch my show, and she whispered to me, ‘You watch the show, you watch the show.’ By the way, my wife watches the show, and my younger son watches it, it’s his favorite. He’s 14. I catch it when they’re watching it. I DVR it, and I support it.” And Mr. Garlin relates to his character, who spends a lot of time in his underwear. “I said, the only difference is you want me to wear tighty-whities, because as soon as I come home, my pants are off,” he said. The show’s wardrobe has authentic ’80s pedigree: the real Beverly sent Ms. McLendon-Covey a box of her old spangled sweaters. (“My mom is a pack rat,” her son noted. “She wants them all back.”) The costumers hoard shoulder pads and scout acid-washed denim. Ms. McLendon-Covey looked to Jazzercise to inspire her physical comedy. The set, too, is a meticulously sourced time warp. The Walkman that TV Adam uses cost $1,000 on eBay, Mr. Goldberg said. Erica’s bedroom boasts a Rick Springfield poster. On the fridge is a chicken recipe from a 1983 Family Circle. Besides being a pop culture wormhole, this show about a Jewish family also fits within ABC’s  Mr. Goldberg’s own family members are fans. His brothers have visited the set, suggesting a change to the children’s photos that hang over the parents’ bed. (Adam, the youngest, always had the biggest portrait.) Murray Goldberg died six years ago; in his honor, his wife brought his recliner to the premiere in their Pennsylvania hometown. (She still  Mr. Goldberg is also open to ideas from other people in his past. This season, his high school drama teacher pitched a plotline, and earned a story credit. Still, he will not let anyone else edit the home videos that have become the show’s signature. In small doses, they’re cute, he said. “But when you sit down and watch, like, 10 minutes, you’re, like, this is a weird lonely kid, a weird lonely geek who loves his camera.” “I wasn’t a sweet kid,” he added. “I was an instigator, and provoked everyone with my goofy hyena cackle, loving every minute of the drama I could create.”
