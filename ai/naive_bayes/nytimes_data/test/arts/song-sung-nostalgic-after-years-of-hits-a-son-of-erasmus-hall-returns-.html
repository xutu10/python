Song Sung Nostalgic: After Years of Hits, a Son of Erasmus Hall Returns 
On Monday, Neil Diamond turned homeward and performed in Brooklyn for the first time since becoming a star, with a concert in Flatbush at Erasmus Hall High School.

Neil Diamond’s Brooklyn heritage is not as obvious as that of the Beastie Boys or Spike Lee. After all, he sings about Kentucky women, and his classic “Sweet Caroline” has been adopted as an anthem in enemy territory, at Fenway Park. But on Monday, Mr. Diamond turned homeward and performed in Brooklyn for the first time since becoming a star, with a concert in Flatbush at Erasmus Hall High School. “The memories are flooding back,” said Mr. Diamond, who attended Erasmus Hall from 1954 to 1956. He then launched into “Brooklyn Roads.” Mr. Diamond announced the concert on Sunday on Twitter, and at 3 p.m. on Monday fans lined up on Flatbush Avenue to get their free tickets. The crowd was a mix of curious locals and fans, some of whom had driven hundreds of miles. Mary Lynn Murphy, 64, who lives in Marine Park, said she was racing the parking meter. “I figured if I get in, it’s the same as a $35 ticket.” Dennis and Jackie Beck, 66 and 64, traveled from western Pennsylvania. Ms. Beck said she had seen Mr. Diamond 10 times. “It’s not that many,” she said. She sported a “Diamond Girl” shirt and said she was convinced that this concert at his old stamping grounds would be special. “He’s an emotional guy,” she said. A largely middle-age crowd of about 800 filled the wooden seats in the hot auditorium. Pictures of Barbra Streisand (class of ’59) lined the walls. The older fans and a handful of Erasmus students jubilantly sang Mr. Diamond’s hits even before the concert began; one woman danced along with a “Holly Holy” sign and a hand-drawn T-shirt bedecked with Mr. Diamond’s song titles and lyrics. The crowd exploded during the encore of “Sweet Caroline,” as Mr. Diamond repeated the chorus over and over. Mr. Diamond, 73, is expected on Tuesday to announce a new tour beginning in February. In a telephone interview afterward, Mr. Diamond sounded tired but content. “It’s really completing the circle,” he said. “When I was a kid, it was all about the Dodgers and Coney Island and Nathan’s. I’m very proud to call myself a Brooklynite.”
