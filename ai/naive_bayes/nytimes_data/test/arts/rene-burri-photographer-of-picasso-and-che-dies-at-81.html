Ren&eacute; Burri, Photographer of Picasso and Che, Dies at 81 
Mr. Burri was a globe-trotting photographer who documented figures like Pablo Picasso and Che Guevara, as well as urban scenes and war.

René Burri, a globe-trotting photographer who saw his camera as a “magic wand,” as he put it, to illuminate the “pulse of life” — whether an expression on Picasso’s face, a surreal urban scene or the ravages of war — died on Monday in Zurich. He was 81. Magnum Photos, the cooperative of which he was a longtime member, announced the death. Mr. Burri, a dashing figure who favored a wide-brimmed fedora and a long white scarf, believed that only a handful of images survive any photographer. If so, several of his early black-and-white photographs would seem to be strong candidates. His 1963 photograph of Che Guevara, Fidel Castro’s revolutionary comrade, head tilted back and smoking a cigar, came to be reproduced on everything from sofa cushions to condom packets — without the photographer’s permission. His 1960 photo looking down at four suited men walking mysteriously on the rooftop of a skyscraper in São Paulo, smoke swirling in the foreground, suggests the drama, glamour and vertigo of life in a giant city. Then there is Pablo Picasso. When Mr. Burri (pronounced BOO-ree) first saw Picasso’s “Guernica” in 1953, he vowed to meet the artist. Hanging out in front of his studio turned out to be fruitless. Then, in 1957, he heard that Picasso was in Nîmes, France, to watch a bullfight. At Picasso’s hotel, a porter mistook Mr. Burri for a member of the artist’s entourage. Mr. Burri entered Picasso’s room to find 13 people engaged in a raucous meal. “Picasso looks at me and said, ‘Sit down and eat!’ ” Mr. Burri said in an interview with The New York Times in 2004. He was allowed to take pictures and, he recalled, immediately saw “endless possibilities.” What resulted, the The Guardian of London reported in 2004, was “a wonderfully vivid sequence of portraits, Picasso laughing and clapping and betraying not the tiniest sign that a private party had just been interrupted.” Mr. Burri’s pictures tell the story of much of the second half of the 20th century. There are conflicts — from the 1956 Suez crisis through Korea, Cyprus and Vietnam. There are portraits of Argentine cowboys. He did a color essay on the Holy Land and a book on German society. His pictures of artists, like one of Alberto Giacometti in mid-drag of a cigarette, were themselves praised as art. In 1987, his exhibition “An American Dream,” at the International Center of Photography in Manhattan, explored the United States space and defense programs.  In an interview cited on  René Burri was born in Zurich on April 9, 1933. His father was a chef who brought home eels, crabs and other delicacies. “I wanted to go to all those places where those incredible beasts came from,” Mr. Burri told The Economist in 2012. His first picture, taken at 13 with his father’s camera, is a startlingly assured one of Winston Churchill standing in his convertible limousine during a visit to Zurich. From ages 16 to 20, Mr. Burri studied photography at a school of arts and crafts, and in 1954, while in the Swiss Army, his commanding officer encouraged him to take photos for a news bulletin. An instructor from the arts and crafts school introduced him to Werner Bischof, a Magnum photographer, who recommended him to the cooperative. Mr. Burri became an associate photographer there in 1956 and a full member in 1959. Mr. Bischof died in 1954, and in 1963 Mr. Burri married his widow, Rosellina. She died in 1986. Their two children survive him, as do his second wife, Clotilde Blanc, and their son. Mr. Burri had exhibitions around the world and published several books, including  Mr. Burri was almost as fastidious about refraining from taking pictures as about taking them. He thought photos of battlefield violence aroused emotions without providing insight. During the Six-Day War in 1967, for example, he saw a blackened hand sticking up out of the Middle East sand. “If I’d taken a photo of it, it would have been shown all over the world — but I just couldn’t,” he told The Guardian Weekly in 1984. Similarly, he told The Times, he once saw the fiercely secretive Greta Garbo walking down a New York street but out of respect could not bring himself to raise his camera. And he refrained from snapping Fidel Castro with an exit sign positioned perfectly above his head, apparently to avoid conveying a simplistic message. “One of these days,” Mr. Burri said, “I’m going to publish a book of all the pictures I did not take. It is going to be a huge hit.”
