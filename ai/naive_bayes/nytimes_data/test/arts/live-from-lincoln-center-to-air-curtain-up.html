‘Live From Lincoln Center’ to Air ‘Curtain Up’
A “Live From Lincoln Center” broadcast of “Curtain Up” documents a commemoration of the School of American Ballet’s 80th anniversary.

America has far too few broadcasts of performances by its own dancers on either television or the big screen. In cinemas, it’s become easier in recent years to see current performances by the Bolshoi and the Royal Ballet than by New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater. This is bizarre; no city in the world has a better claim to be Dance City than New York, and yet there’s far too little evidence of this (or of dance across America) on our screens. Where is local pride? Money is needed. The result would be well worth it, to show the nation (and the world) just how high the standards of dance here often are. One happy exception comes this weekend with the “Live From Lincoln Center” broadcast of “Curtain Up: The School of American Ballet Workshop Performance” (not actually live; six months old) on most PBS stations, beginning on Friday. (Channel 13 in New York will air the program on Sunday.) This documents the performance that  The program’s excellent direction is by Matthew Diamond. Camerawork employs a judicious mix of long shots and close-ups; there’s a tingling sense of immediacy. Even if you know this choreography, details of musicality hit you with terrific freshness, almost as if you were dancing these steps yourself: You don’t just see and hear how they are danced and to which beats and phrases, you feel it in your body. In a short introduction, Peter Martins — ballet master in chief of City Ballet, as well as co-director of the school — says he knows nothing more beautiful than the zealous devotion and application of young students to the impossible perfection of ballet; the dancing that follows movingly bears out his words. The greatest marvel here is “Serenade.” No ballet is more rewatchable — or more miraculous. Even if you think you’ve absorbed all its wealth of details, they add up in new ways on each viewing, and things we know we’ve always seen keep hitting us as if for the first time. It’s been almost 39 years since I first watched this masterpiece. Yet to watch this graduation performance was to marvel at it anew. The young dancers perform it with ideal innocence. “Serenade” contains drama, but it simply happens to them as if it were far larger than they can comprehend; their lack of sentimentality and their cool, brisk immersion in the moment are ravishing. There are steps in this broadcast that gleam all the more brightly on the screen. How many instances there are of the complex beaten jump cabriole/entrechat-trois! The legs and feet sparklingly beat in the air, with a change of angle halfway before the dancer lands on one foot. It’s a Balanchine favorite, but I’d never noticed how many times it occurs here. You also notice how fully the cast has mastered salient features of Balanchine style: the radiant opening of the whole body from its central axis; the skeins of fast turns in which the dancers “spot” by facing not in the direction of the turn but to the audience; the fearless transfer of weight stepping out far through space; the flowerlike opening of fingers; and much more. The waltz for the children in Act III of “Coppélia” immediately establishes the multiple layers of Balanchine’s musicality. Three solos are framed chorally by the tiny children on the perimeters of the stage. The deep, spacious fourth positions they hold at the end of the Dawn solo are especially striking: another sign of the spreading openness of the Balanchine idiom. The young men in the Discord and War dance have a virile force you don’t expect in teenagers: precision, too. There are admirable features to the “Swan Lake” dances. Alston MacGill, the Odette here, is a striking dancer, especially in the high-voltage passages where this version is at its most singular. Her partner, Joshua Shutkind, not only dances impressively but also stands and partners with striking steadfastness. The best documentary sections feature Susan Pilarre, the coach of the “Western Symphony” finale. She recalls how Balanchine would say, “Little more effort, dear, little more effort,” and she remarks: “You always felt everybody was important to his painting; he couldn’t do it without you.” The swaggering, funny élan of the dance is irresistible.
