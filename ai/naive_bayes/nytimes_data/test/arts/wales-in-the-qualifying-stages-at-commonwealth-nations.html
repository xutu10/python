Wales in the Qualifying Stages at Commonwealth Nations

Every Daily Bulletin at the Fourth Commonwealth Nations Bridge Championships in Glasgow this month contained a card-play problem. This deal, from the qualifying stage of the main event, could have been used. How should South play in four hearts after West leads the diamond six through dummy’s bid suit? The deal was drawn to my attention by Patrick Jourdain, who was on the gold-medal-winning team, Wales. The auction at Jourdain’s table went as shown. Jourdain’s partner, Tony Ratcliff (West), led his singleton diamond. The declarer won with his king, played a spade to dummy’s king, returned a spade to his ace, ruffed a spade and discarded his last spade on the diamond ace. However, West ruffed and led the club king. (A low club would also have worked.) Now East had to get a club ruff, and the defenders took their two top hearts and the two ruffs for down one. If you can ruff a loser in the shorter trump hand, it is usually the right play — but not when you can take ten tricks just by drawing trumps. South should have led a high trump at Trick 2, aiming to take two spades, four hearts, three diamonds and one club. If East wins the trick and leads a diamond, South will ruff. Or if East shifts to his club, declarer will win in the dummy and trump a diamond in his hand. West can overruff and cash a high club, but South will lose only two hearts and one club. It is unusual that a deal in which declarer only has to draw trumps should prove so interesting. And declarer should have anticipated that West’s opening lead was a singleton, given that it was dummy’s bid suit.
