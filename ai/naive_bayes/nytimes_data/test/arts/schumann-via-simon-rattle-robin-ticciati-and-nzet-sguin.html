Schumann, via Simon Rattle, Robin Ticciati and N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin
Three new or almost-new recordings of Schumann’s symphonies each offers its own rewards.

If Robert Schumann had been a really fine orchestrator — or if he were not the bumbler in that regard that conventional wisdom holds him to be — would his symphonies be more popular today? At the moment it is hard to see how they could be. Simon Rattle And two more complete cycles of the Schumann symphonies have appeared on CD since, with  The Rattle and Nézet-Séguin recordings, both mightily attractive for the overall quality of the performances, are also fascinating for the glimpses they give into the changing nature of the classical recording industry. By old major-label standards, the business seems to be in chaos, but there are also signs of new life from unexpected sources: notably, as with the Berlin venture, the performing institutions themselves. Was there ever a more stable and fruitful recording alliance than the one between the Berlin Philharmonic and Deutsche Grammophon a few decades ago? But the orchestra has spread its wealth since then and has recently shown big ambitions and a strong independent streak in its media activities, with the establishment of a  So now the Philharmonic finds itself in direct competition with Deutsche Grammophon, which has turned to a hot maestro and a more modest ensemble for its latest Schumann. But Mr. Nézet-Séguin has achieved his greatest acclaim as the newish music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, with which he has already recorded for Deutsche Grammophon. So why doesn’t he use the Philadelphians here? Partly, no doubt, because Wolfgang Sawallisch, the orchestra’s music director from 1993 to 2003, stole Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s Schumann thunder long in advance with brilliant live recordings of the symphonies and other works, released on the Philadelphia Orchestra’s own label in 2003. Partly, too, perhaps, because Mr. Nézet-Séguin believes that the ideal solution to the occasional murkiness of Schumann’s instrumentation is to scale back the modern orchestra. “With a lean string section — lean not only in size, but also in its quality of playing — the music just works,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin is quoted as saying in the booklet notes. Instead of, say, 30 violins, he uses 18. Mr. Nézet-Séguin achieves splendid results with this formula: relatively transparent textures played out with tightly sprung rhythms at fleet tempos that he sometimes nudges ahead even more. These performances are, by and large, the very definition of vitality. True, you long for a certain grandeur at times, and those moments are better served by the Rattle recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic. Nothing says, of course, that Mr. Rattle has to use the full orchestra available to him, and to judge from video snippets on the orchestra’s website ( But they play with altogether more heft, a quality born of longstanding tradition and communal spirit. The sound can grow weighty and brash at times, but the playing is always brilliant, with blazing tremolos from the strings, distinctive colorings from the woodwinds and golden orations from the brasses. What posterity has known as Schumann’s Fourth Symphony was actually the second he composed, in 1841. He reworked it in 1851 into the version familiar today. Mr. Rattle reverts to the 1841 version, which he calls in the booklet notes “a symphony full of lightness and grace.” In 1851, he adds, Schumann turned it into “a symphony of darkness and obsession and indeed oppression.” Mr. Rattle is certainly entitled to his choice, but his pronouncement seems extreme. There is nothing particularly dark about the later version in Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s performance, which has the same qualities of lightness and grace that characterize his cycle as a whole. Mr. Ticciati’s recording with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra shares Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s approach in many ways (18 violinists, 1851 version of the Fourth Symphony) and is eminently respectable. But it is slightly out of its depth in this exalted company. If pressed, I would probably choose Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s performances over Mr. Rattle’s. Then I might slink off to find those treasurable Sawallisch-Philadelphia recordings, among the last and best of a storied career. A final note on the Berliner Philharmoniker Recordings’ harebrained presentation: CD packaging has been a horror from the time the technology was introduced, in the 1980s. Attempts to improve on the original plastic jewel boxes by fancifying the packaging, using cardboard sheaths or book bindings often of nonstandard dimensions, have mostly made matters worse for anyone who collects CDs in quantity. The Philharmoniker packaging carries would-be luxury to new heights. About the size and look of a slim hardcover book and more than half filled with stiff cardboard, the Schumann set and a subsequent Bach “St. John Passion” seem designed with an eye to the coffee table, at least as impractical a storage space as whatever spare inches can be found on shelves already crammed with the books they were meant for.
