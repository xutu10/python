‘Court/Garden,’ an Interactive Work From Yanira Castro
Yanira Castro brings music, dance and the audience into play with her work “Court/Garden.”
===
The sanctuary at St. Mark’s Church is a flexible space, configurable in any number of ways. If you frequent Danspace Project, you’ve probably seen dance from all sides of that room. But until Thursday, at the premiere of Yanira Castro’s “ This was one of several audience upheavals in the elaborate three-act evening, procedures that increasingly eroded boundaries between the cast and crew and us. Ms. Castro, who has long investigated those boundaries, turned to the 17th century for inspiration here, specifically to the court of Louis XIV — the birthplace of ballet — in all its grandeur and stringent hierarchy. The choreographer and her vast team of collaborators, A Canary Torsi, mine that rich material in ways both alluring and overly ambitious. Perhaps in the spirit of imperial abundance, “Court/Garden” is packed to the brim, driven by big concepts that are somehow more intriguing from a remove — in anticipation or in retrospect — than in the moment of performance. Act I, the most choreographically striking in its twists on Baroque dance, could be a piece in itself. After posing for a camera near the entrance — our images broadcast before the court, as it were, in a kind of see-and-be-seen ritual — we took our seats facing a maze of mirrored panels. (Kathy Couch was credited with “environment/lighting,” a colossal undertaking.) Performers in white began to reassemble those walls, making way for masked figures in glittering black and gold bodysuits. This fabulous head-to-toe armor by Miodrag Guberinic seemed tailored for battle as much as for dance, as did Stephan Moore’s atmospheric yet militaristic score. An arsenal of clipped, rhythmic steps — shuffling feet, scissoring jumps — paraded the dancers along the mirror-flanked runway. Fast-forward to Act II, through the construction of a paper-towel gown for one enthroned dancer, through that “labor spectacle” with its rearrangement of seats and exposure of theatrical trappings. Two events competed for our attention: a live video feed of dancers backstage and, opposite them, three jaded, tittering operagoers (Tess Dworman, Luke Miller and Kimberly Young), issuing judgments in electronically warped voices. In the shadowy Act III, the dancers (who also included Simon Courchel, Pamela Vail and Darrin Wright) roamed among us, or we among them, our previously assigned roles breaking down. They exited, and the house lights came up, no curtain calls. As she often does, Ms. Castro left us with ourselves.
