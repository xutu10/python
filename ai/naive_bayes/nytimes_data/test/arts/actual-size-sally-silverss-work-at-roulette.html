'Actual Size,' Sally Silvers’s Work at Roulette
Sally Silvers invokes the mood, imagery and plots of the master of suspense in her work at the Chocolate Factory.

Gesture and choreographic structures may not be the first things one notices in a Hitchcock movie. But the right choreographer can unearth a vast inventory of both. In “ The thrills in this roughly hourlong work — and the humor — have a lot to do with the superb cast. Dylan Crossman, Carolyn Hall, Luke Miller, Alicia Ohs, Melissa Toogood, Ms. Silvers and, in Tuesday’s cameo (there’s a different one each night), Pooh Kaye: These dancers are a joy to watch, as individuals and as parts of puzzles that refuse to be solved. No matter how quickly new scenarios come and go, they submerge themselves in the intricacies of every stunt and ruse. The sense of overlapping plots, of a story continuously outsmarting itself, also hinges on Bruce Andrews’s sound design, a careening collage of clips from dozens of Hollywood film scores, mixed live with electronic layers by Michael Schumacher. When Ms. Silvers enters, first on her own and later with Ms. Kaye, Mr. Andrews shifts into talking mode, reciting what sound like a director’s garbled notes. “Premonition caught in a revolving door,” he asserts. “Roller coaster with consequences.” Ursula Scherrer’s black-and-white videos cut between noirish images of the dancers, shots of swarming crowds (presumably borrowed from Hitchcock) and speckled or bladelike geometric patterns. Projected onto black mesh panels that hang along three sides of the room, and enhanced by Joe Levasseur’s lighting, these seem to multiply the dimensions of the otherwise unadorned space. Much of the action in “Actual Size,” as with any good work of suspense, is contingent on multiple people and their impeccable yet seemingly slapdash timing. When Ms. Ohs catapults herself into Mr. Miller’s arms, using Mr. Crossman’s back as a launching pad, or when Mr. Crossman dives beneath three dancers sprinting toward him, it’s as though they’re pulling off these feats at the last possible second. In a wry critique of Hitchcockian gender dynamics, Mr. Crossman and Ms. Toogood re-enact a love scene from “North by Northwest,” gesture for cheesy gesture: her fingers creepily tracing his ear, his hands awkwardly gripping her head. “Actual Size” transforms itself so frequently that it risks becoming monotonous. But even monotony, in small doses, can keep you wondering what will happen next.
