Of Magic Lanterns and Screen Gems
In “Before the Movies,” the historians Terry and Deborah Borton share a fraction of their memorabilia collection.

The historians  The Bortons’ new book, “Before the Movies: American Magic-Lantern Entertainment and the Nation’s First Great Screen Artist, Joseph Boggs Beale” (John Libbey Publishing/ Charles Musser, a Yale professor, writes in the new volume’s foreword that “Beale failed to gain traction in the scholarly community” possibly because he “escaped familiar categories.” The Bortons recently gave a tour of their remote cottage near Old Saybrook, Conn. They had brought out Beale artifacts, which they mostly keep in storage. They also re-enacted a typical 19th-century performance with a magic lantern. Ms. Borton banged a huge metal gong to grab the attention of the tiny audience (me), and then Mr. Borton manipulated glass slides inside the boxy wooden projector. He also recited fragments of scripts written for slides that were sold in sets. As he fed the images into slots, sunrises burst forth on-screen, dancers and Noah’s animals paraded, and a monkey somersaulted. “What a ham that monkey is,” Mr. Borton said. His wife gently teased him: “What a ham the projectionist is.” Beale, the son of a dentist, trained at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and sketched Civil War battles and 1860s baseball players before taking a staff job designing slides. His employer, Caspar W. Briggs, marketed the products to showmen who flashed through slides while singing hymns; giving history lectures; proselytizing against vice; and quoting poems, folk tales, Shakespeare plays, novels and the Bible. The Bortons have paid modest sums for Beale material through websites and at antiques stores; they recognize unsigned Beale artworks among the hundreds of slides that surface daily on eBay. In addition to Beale’s designs, they own roomfuls of vintage posters for other makers’ slide shows. Mr. Borton calls their delving into what audiences flocked to see a century ago “experiential archaeology.” The couple have tracked down Beale’s papers, from his childhood diary to his final letters looking for work. In his writings, Mr. Borton said, “You get the sense of a gentle, caring, meticulous sort of person.” After Beale’s death in 1926, his family and Briggs dispersed many of his possessions. A Philadelphia art dealer named Arthur Colen bought hundreds of Beale sketches and exhibited them in prominent places including the Whitney Museum of American Art. Colen described Beale as a forgotten folk painter, not mentioning the factory job designing slides. “Magic lanterns were passé, so Colen concocted this story,” Mr. Borton said. Beale works have been scattered at institutions including the  Next spring, the couple will set up a public gallery for magic lantern memorabilia and equipment at the  FOUND IN THE MARGINS In the last few months, foundations have given out hundreds of thousands of dollars to support research on the scribbles in the margins of old books. Johns Hopkins University, Princeton and University College London have received funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to partner on a database, “The Archaeology of Reading in Early Modern Europe.” It will focus on 16th-century marginalia from the writers Gabriel Harvey, Isaac Casaubon and John Dee. Earle Havens, a library curator and professor at Johns Hopkins, said in an interview that the three “could not open a book without a pen in their hand.” “The Archaeology of Reading” Lisa Jardine, a professor at University College London, said that in Harvey’s marginalia, “You watch him move up the social ladder, but then he can’t straddle the final hurdles.” Volumes marked up with handwriting used to be described as “dirty books” among dealers, she added. But in the modern age of words mostly appearing online, marginal notes can actually increase value. “Now they’re gold dust,” she said. In May, at  Marginalia from noncelebrities have also become prized. Andrew Stauffer, an associate professor at the University of Virginia, is investigating what forgotten people wrote in books partly with the help of a grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources. He and his colleague Kara M. McClurken are collaborating on “Hidden in Plain Sight,” an effort to document traces of past owners in 19th-century books at the university’s Alderman Library. Dr. Stauffer also runs  Dr. Stauffer envisions organizing volunteers to sift through bookshelves, he said, and he hopes to raise awareness that volumes being sold or given away should at least be checked for inscriptions. Too often, he added, libraries have a policy of removing pencil marks that turn up, considering them a form of vandalism. “Who knows what’s already been erased?” he said. Among his favorite handwritten finds is a poem that Ellen Pierrepont Minor, a Brooklyn surgeon’s wife, penciled in 1862 in a poetry collection by Felicia Hemans. “The gifted and the beautiful is from our sight withdrawn,” Mrs. Minor wrote in memory of her third daughter, Mary, 7, who had just died. The grieving mother’s elegy ends with “Our fairest, loveliest flower/Mary, Mary, Mary.”
