The Hong Kong-born artist Paul Chan has won the $100,000 Hugo Boss Prize, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation announced on Thursday. “Paul’s protean ability to work across multiple platforms from his videos to his more elegiac light pieces and community-based performances is what particularly stood out,” said Nancy Spector, the Guggenheim’s deputy director and chief curator. Ms. Spector was chairwoman of the jury of five curators and museum directors who made the selection, which recognizes achievement in contemporary art. “Recently, he has started an electronic and print publishing venture called Badlands Unlimited.” Mr. Chan, 41, has already had solo exhibitions in the United States and Europe, at the Schaulager in Basel, Switzerland, this year. Called “Selected Works,” it was an overview of his career, including videos, works on paper and sculptures. Kathy Halbreich, associate director of the Museum of Modern Art, once said of Mr. Chan’s work, “He has figured out a way to make the perils of our time accessible.” The prize was established in 1996 by the Guggenheim Foundation and the German company Hugo Boss. Mr. Chan was selected from a list of five finalists including Sheela Gowda, who lives and works in Bangalore, India, where she creates paintings, sculptures and installations that speak to the culture of India; Camille Henrot, a French artist and filmmaker who lives in Paris and New York, creating videos and animated films that deal with broad subjects, like the history of civilization; Hassan Khan, an Egyptian artist living in Cairo who makes videos and sculptural installations that reflect cultural issues; and Charline von Heyl, a German-born painter who lives in New York and is best known for her abstract canvases. In addition to the monetary prize, Mr. Chan will be given an exhibition of his work at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in the spring. COMICS ON THE MALL  The list of fall acquisitions the National Gallery of Art in Washington will announce on Friday includes comic books — a first for the institution. William and Abigail Gerdts, American art scholars and longtime donors to the gallery, have given it 176 comic books published between 1964 and 1977. They are prime examples of the zany work that was being produced by the San Francisco underground at the time. Included are seminal issues of Zap Comix, founded by R. Crumb, one of the grandfathers of underground cartooning. There is also work from Arcade: The Comics Revue, started by Art Spiegelman and Bill Griffith. “How can you think about artists like Lichtenstein, Warhol, Guston or even Picasso, who loved cartoons, without comic books?” Judith Brodie, the curator of modern prints and drawings at the National Gallery, said, explaining that comic books added a layer to the story of Pop Art. Other acquisitions this season — primarily works on paper — tell different stories. Top among them are three preliminary impressions of Richard Diebenkorn’s “Green,” considered by experts to be his greatest print. Last year, when the gallery held the show “Yes, No, Maybe: Artists Working at Crown Point Press,” it featured the final-edition print of “Green” from its collection alongside these three preliminary impressions or proofs. “They were unknown until 2007, when Kathan Brown, founder of Crown Point Press, was readying the basement for a fire inspection,” Ms. Brodie said. “It was there she found a brown paper roll labeled ‘Save for Dick for collage,’ and inside were 12 working proofs, which happily included the three just acquired by the gallery.” Although they are called proofs, each is more like a collage or watercolor, Ms. Brodie said, because Diebenkorn added elements to them like bits of paper. He also often painted over the basic print. Another significant acquisition is “Fort Peck Dam, Montana,” Margaret Bourke-White’s 1936 photograph depicting giant buttresses whose crenelated tops, supports for an elevated highway, looked like the walls of a fortress. Not only is it a powerful image as a symbol of the machine age, but it also appeared on the cover of the first issue of Life magazine. “Vintage prints like this in good condition don’t come on the market often,” said Sarah Greenough, the senior curator who runs the gallery’s photography department. “We’d been looking for an iconic vintage print by her for some time.” The gallery bought it from Howard Greenberg, the New York dealer, who had purchased it for $149,000 at a Bonhams auction in April. SPIRIT OF ’76 Nine women swathed in the American flag will be the next image passers-by see splashed across the billboard at West 18th Street and 10th Avenue in a parking lot next to the High Line in Chelsea. “Nine Female Inmates of the Cincinnati Workhouse Participating in a Patriotic Tableau,” a painting John Wesley made in 1976 to commemorate the American Bicentennial, has been reimagined and adapted by Mr. Wesley, now 85, to conform to the 25-by-75-foot format of the billboard. “John’s work is so important and powerful and has not been seen here a lot,” said Cecilia Alemani, curator and director of High Line Art. “When we asked him about doing something for the billboard, he chose this painting to adapt to the site.” The tongue-in-cheek image, which can be read either as women wearing prison stripes or a humorously patriotic gesture, Ms. Alemani said, “is very pertinent right now, because it reminds us of the many stories behind a nation.” The image will be on view from Dec. 1 to Jan. 2. A MOVE IN CHELSEA Lehmann Maupin is moving its Chelsea headquarters four blocks south to 536 West 22nd Street, currently home to the Sonnabend Gallery, which is closing at the end of the year. “We’ve been on 26th Street since 2002,” said David Maupin, one of Lehmann Maupin’s founders, “but they are tearing it down to build a new commercial space.” (In August, the real estate private equity firm Savanna unveiled renderings of a nine-story commercial building designed for the site by Morris Adjmi. The firm also received approval to tear down the existing building.) Mr. Maupin said the gallery planned to have two spaces in Chelsea eventually, in addition to his gallery on Chrystie Street on the Lower East Side and one in Hong Kong, because “our roster of artists requires a variety of spaces.”
