The Soprano Sonya Yoncheva Is Poised for Stardom
Sonya Yoncheva, a Bulgarian soprano, finds herself at a turning point, as her career takes off, propelled by raw talent, serendipity and hard work.

Sonya Yoncheva, a Bulgarian soprano on the brink of stardom, received a phone call with a bold request last month at her home in Switzerland. Could she quickly learn the role of Mimì in Puccini’s “La Bohème,” fly to New York and sing the part onstage, for the first time, at the Metropolitan Opera just five weeks after giving birth to her first child? “I know it’s a crazy thing, but do you think you can do it?” Ms. Yoncheva, 32, recalled her agent asking when she got the offer to fill in for another soprano who had withdrawn on short notice. “But when the Metropolitan called me for this, I didn’t think twice. I just went for it.” So she scrambled to get a passport for her baby boy, Mateo. In the middle of the night, as she nursed him, she would study the score of “Bohème.” She knew all the arias and the main duet, but not the rest. But if it was all a bit of a tightrope walk for a new mother and a burgeoning opera star, she did not fall: When she first sang the role this month, she earned  Now, the Met has big plans for Ms. Yoncheva: Peter Gelb, its general manager, disclosed in an interview that he had engaged Ms. Yoncheva to sing at next year’s opening night as Desdemona in a new production of Verdi’s “Otello” that is to be directed by Bartlett Sher. “My hope is that she will become one of the big stars of the Met, and I’m working with her to make sure that she sings here at least twice every season going forward,” Mr. Gelb said. Ms. Yoncheva finds herself at a turning point, as her career takes off, propelled by raw talent, serendipity and hard work. Her days as a brave, and successful, last-minute fill-in are giving way to invitations to anchor new productions at leading opera houses. In January, Sony Classical will release her debut album, a series of French- and Parisian-theme arias that will be called “Paris, Mon Amour.” This week, over coffee in the Upper West Side apartment where she is staying, Ms. Yoncheva, who had just taken Mateo for a checkup at the pediatrician’s and a walk in Central Park, described some of the twists and turns that had brought her there. Parts of her biography would be familiar to many singers, including the piano lessons she took as a child and the rigorous music education she got while growing up in Plovdiv, the second-largest city in Bulgaria, and the conservatory training. Others aspects would be less familiar: As a teenager, Ms. Yoncheva became the host of a Bulgarian television show. “It was something completely new to me, and I was a very timid person,” she recalled of the music-theme show, which ranged from rock to classical. “It helped me later on to be better onstage: to learn your face, your expressions, and above all, to fight the fear.” She took up singing in a serious way. One of her formative experiences, she said, was becoming a member of William Christie’s academy for young Baroque and early music singers, Le Jardin des Voix, which gave her the chance to learn early music and tour. That led to more engagements at opera houses and then, in 2010, Ms. Yoncheva won  “What was most important to learn after ‘Operalia’ was that it’s not important to win,” she recalled. “It’s important to defend your title. It’s very important to remain on that level, and to be — how to say? — to be always ready, always in good shape, always awake and always aware of what you’re doing.” That readiness has served her well, especially when unexpected opportunities arose. Last year, Ms. Yoncheva made her debut at the Met ahead of schedule when another soprano withdrew from Verdi’s “Rigoletto” because she was pregnant. Her performance caused  That was followed by an even higher-stakes substitution. When Anna Netrebko, one of the biggest stars in opera, withdrew from performances of Gounod’s “Faust” in Europe last season, saying that the role of Marguerite no longer suited her voice, Ms. Yoncheva was once again called upon to fill in. A reviewer for The Guardian said that Ms. Yoncheva was “surely a star in the making” and  “It’s a really crazy year for me,” she said of all the switches. “Because I always have to learn these parts at the last moment.” This season has proved even crazier. Ms. Yoncheva was originally scheduled to sing her first Mimì this month at the San Francisco Opera with the tenor Michael Fabiano. Then she learned that she and her husband, the conductor Domingo Hindoyan, were expecting their first child, and that the baby was due just as rehearsals were set to begin. She withdrew. Then things began to change. Quickly. First the Met asked if she would  At first, Ms. Yoncheva said, the Met only asked if she would sing at a few of the later performances, and she agreed, thinking that she would have several weeks to prepare. Then, she said, the company asked if she would do more, which gave her little time to get ready. Adding to the chaos, the tenor who was scheduled to sing Rodolfo, Ramón Vargas, withdrew because of illness, so Ms. Yoncheva found herself singing opposite a rotating roster of Rodolfos. (The Met announced Wednesday that a new Rodolfo would join the cast for two performances next month, after Ms. Yoncheva moves on: Mr. Fabiano, who sang the role in the San Francisco production that she withdrew from.) Ms. Yoncheva’s first performance as Mimì was on Nov. 14, which turned out to be, by an odd stroke of fate, the same night she had originally been scheduled to make her debut in the role in San Francisco. Mr. Gelb made a brief curtain speech before the performance that night. “I said to the audience that we were very fortunate that she had decided to spend her maternity leave singing on the stage of the Met,” he recalled.
