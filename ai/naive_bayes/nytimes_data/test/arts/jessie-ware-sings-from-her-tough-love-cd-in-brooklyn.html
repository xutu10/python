Jessie Ware Sings From Her ‘Tough Love’ CD in Brooklyn
The British singer Jessie Ware brings her understated yet powerful style to her fans at the Brooklyn Masonic Temple.

The standout track on Jessie Ware’s first album was  Like most of that debut album, “Devotion,” this was a slow ache, with the residue of club music and early-mid-90s R&B.; Ms. Ware loves to seep all over a track, spreading her voice out and letting it decay. Maybe that’s part of the reason she hasn’t been a part of the recent ascent of her fellow Britons who move at a quicker pace. Early on she worked with the garage duo Disclosure, which has gone on to wide acclaim and success thanks to America’s late embrace of “Latch,” its collaboration with Sam Smith. Mr. Smith, too, has found unusual success, but he’s more comfortable moving at quick speeds than Ms. Ware is, even if he’s actually the more conservative singer. At the Brooklyn Masonic Temple on Tuesday night, Ms. Ware held her ground in a performance that drew heavily from her just-released second album, “Tough Love” (PMR/Friends Keep Secrets/Interscope), which is even more restrained than her debut. It was a sleek presentation — Ms. Ware in a black pantsuit with black turtleneck; her band in black and white; the spotlights on them much busier than they were. Even the length was controlled — just over a cool hour, no encore. Ms. Ware has a sterling voice, one which she controls with pinpoint precision. She barely does any runs, preferring a less frenzied approach. The feeling, though, was anything but contained. Ms. Ware — who has a writing credit on every song on the new album, joined by the likes of Devonte Hynes, Romy Madley Croft of the xx, Benny Blanco and Miguel — has a way of pulling deep meaning from few words. “Yeah, actions/They speak louder than the words you sow,” she sang on “Cruel.” On “Want Your Feeling,” one of the album’s faster tracks, she cooed, “How could you keep forgetting/I wanted it all?/Lights still shining in the room you left me in.” The most striking song on the new album is “Pieces,” a slow-heartbeat meditation on being let down. “I was so sure this was real, but/Now I’m sure of nothing at all,” she sings, swelling slightly just before the chorus, in which she explodes: I had to shatter to pieces It made me reveal myself, reveal myself So if you no longer need this I’ll give them to someone else, someone else The crowd sang loudly at this part, much as they had been for the majority of the night. Ms. Ware inspires fervor, and appears still to be genuinely moved by the sheer number and intensity of her fans: During the show she accepted flowers from one and what appeared to be a drawing of her first album cover from another. Near the end of the night, she sang “Wildest Moments,” which had the feeling of a coronation. It’s her usual show closer, and one that didn’t require her to sing at all: The crowd was that loud. After finishing it, she began introducing what she said would be her final song of the night. “I hope,” she said to the crowd, “that this could be your new ‘Wildest Moments.’ ” The quiet percussion of
