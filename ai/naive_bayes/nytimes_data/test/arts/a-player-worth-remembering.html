The New York City bridge community lost one of its most popular members, Kathy Anday-Fallenius, on Nov. 9. She and her husband, the Swede and former European champion Bjorn Fallenius, have owned and run the Cavendish Club in Manhattan for the last 20 years or so. For many years, she was the editor of the Greater New York Bridge Association’s magazine Post-Mortem and a longtime board member. Away from bridge, she was multitalented.
