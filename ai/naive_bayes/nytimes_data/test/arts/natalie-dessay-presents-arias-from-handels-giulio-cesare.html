Natalie Dessay Presents Arias From Handel’s ‘Giulio Cesare’
Natalie Dessay embodied a mature Cleopatra in excerpts from “Giulio Cesare” with Le Concert d’Astrée on Sunday at Alice Tully Hall.

Few operatic journeys are richer than the eight arias that bring Cleopatra, the star of Handel’s “Giulio Cesare,” from innocence to experience. Performing them together gives a tantalizing sense of the “infinite variety” that Shakespeare found in this shrewd, seductive Egyptian queen. Yet it is telling that the French soprano  She also dispensed with those early arias on Sunday at Alice Tully Hall, where she, the countertenor  That is no accident. In October 2013, in the midst of a production of Massenet’s “Manon” in Toulouse, France, she revealed  Her retirement was brought on, at least partly, by the nature of her talent. Her light, silvery voice and adorable presence made her a natural in roles like Zerbinetta in Strauss’s “Ariadne auf Naxos” and Morgana in Handel’s “Alcina”: opera’s bubbly youngsters. “It’s not that I’m leaving opera,” she told Le Figaro. “It’s that opera is leaving me.” By that, she meant that she was increasingly uncomfortable to be nearing 50 and still playing teenagers. But she had nowhere else to go in the repertory, having never been quite as convincing, vocally or dramatically, in tragic parts like Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor or Violetta in Verdi’s “La Traviata” and lacking the vocal heft to shift to heavier roles. In many ways, Handel’s Cleopatra has best fit the bill over the past few years, showing off Ms. Dessay’s high-flying coloratura prowess and her more mature side. Last year at the Met, she was game for the role, if vocally ill at ease. On Sunday, in a smaller hall, with a smaller orchestra and a conductor with whom she seems entirely comfortable, she was more persuasive. Ms. Dessay’s voice is now an exaggerated version of what it was in her heyday, for both better and worse. The floating, bell-like clarity she used to attain on certain notes may, if anything, be even more uncannily lucid now, and her precision in quick-moving runs — like those in the triumphant “Da tempeste” — remains exceptional. But what used to be just a hint of sour thinness in her tone, which you either accepted as a quirk or didn’t, has become more pervasive. In “V’adoro pupille,” Ms. Dessay lacked a certain measure of sensuality, and in the great lament “Se pietà,” her phrasing was too curt to build emotional momentum. But Ms. Haïm and Le Concert d’Astrée, sounding silky and suave, supported her at every turn, and Ms. Dessay’s voice blended into the instrumental textures in “Piangerò” to ravishing effect. Mr. Dumaux, who played the villainous Tolomeo opposite Ms. Dessay at the Met last year, was here promoted to the opera’s title role, sounding forceful but without edge as a confident yet sensitive Cesare. Le Concert d’Astrée was sweet-toned and alert throughout, with crucial solos from the violinist David Plantier and the flutist Sébastien Marq. The ensemble was particularly artful in the Suite in G from Handel’s “Water Music,” a cleverly selected interlude that matched the arias on the program in vivacity and poignancy.
