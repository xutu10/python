Orpheus Chamber Orchestra Opens Season at Carnegie Hall
The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra played its first concert of the season at Carnegie Hall, featuring works by Rossini and Beethoven.

Listeners’ first reaction to the  What is truly remarkable, as Orpheus’s season-opening concert at Carnegie Hall on Thursday evening reminded listeners, is the degree of nuance these players achieve in their interpretations. It arises from a rehearsal method the orchestra has evolved over its 42 years, in which each performance is guided by a team of players, called core musicians, the personnel shifting from one performance to the next. The salutary results were evident from the outset on Thursday in a highly charged performance of Rossini’s little overture to his one-act opera “La Cambiale di Matrimonio” (“The Marriage Contract”). Sure, Orpheus members can all play together, but how do they shape a crescendo or taper a decrescendo so exquisitely, achieve such subtleties of phrasing, speak so eloquently with a single voice? The same was true at the beginning of Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 3. What was left to the soloist,  Throughout, his nervous energy generally kept the performance on edge. But he also injected drama and opened room for thought, bringing each movement to a momentary hushed standstill in a different way. After intermission, Orpheus offered Ellen Taaffe Zwilich’s Prologue and Variations, from 1983, an attractive 12-minute piece for strings that takes its main cue from Shostakovich and the four-note motto he used as his signature. The variations — not based on a single theme, in typical fashion — roam through the riffs of the prologue, altering and combining them. Ms. Zwilich, who turned 75 in April, was on hand to revel in the deserved ovation. The program closed with Poulenc’s lovely Sinfonietta, from 1947, a work that glories in slightly off-kilter harmonies and rhythms and, near the end, threatens a complete breakdown, but just for an exhilarating moment. And yes, even an experienced Orpheus aficionado had to wonder at how the string players achieved that unanimity in the skittering finale without a conductor. Core musicians stood out among the evening’s soloists: Stewart Rose, on French horn, in the Rossini; Romie de Guise-Langlois, a wonderful young clarinetist, in the Beethoven; Alan Kay, a veteran clarinetist, and Roni Gal-Ed, an oboist, in the Poulenc.
