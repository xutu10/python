‘Selected Letters,’ Norman Mailer’s Correspondence
“Selected Letters of Norman Mailer” presents 714 of the more than 45,000 pieces of correspondence he wrote to his wives, children, friends, critics and a Who’s Who of world culture and letters.

There were many reasons to hope that this collection of letters would be great or near-great, yet “Selected Letters of Norman Mailer” is mostly low-wattage, a rolling brownout of his vast intellect and talent. Mailer (1923-2007) loathed composing letters and tended to dictate them in industrial-size batches, as many as 50 in a day. Working on them made him feel slack and etiolated, like a marathoner forced to stagger around the track a second time. He was wary of planting a sharp ax. “For Christ’s sake it’s precisely because I am a professional writer that I write such bad letters,” he wrote to a friend in 1962. “I hate the thought of losing a good phrase or turning a sentence nicely when it isn’t for keeps.” He called his inbox Little Guilt Mountain. He reserved the term Guilt Mountain for the unread books he was sent. “I lose about six friends a year for not having read their books,” he says. For someone with “an aversion to the epistolary art,” however, Mailer spun out letters maniacally, some 45,000 of them over the course of his career. “Mailer had a middle-class respect for social obligations,” says J. Michael Lennon, the  The first arrives from Harvard, which Mr. Mailer entered in 1939. He informs his parents that he’s not joining the satirical magazine The Lampoon because he’s not funny enough, and because he can’t afford the $100 initiation fee. He’s decided to join The Harvard Advocate, a literary magazine, instead. He hopes they’ll forward him the $40 fee. Before long, he is married and off to fight in  He returns and publishes his first novel, One of the drawbacks of Mailer’s correspondence is that he never found a pushy, witty and intense opponent with whom to bounce ideas and gossip back and forth, the way Evelyn Waugh had Nancy Mitford, Henry Miller had Anaïs Nin, and  The back cover of “Selected Letters of Norman Mailer” lists the bold names he corresponded with, and it’s a Who’s Who of world culture and letters, from James Baldwin, Saul Bellow and Jorge Luis Borges to Fidel Castro, Clint Eastwood and Hillary Rodham Clinton. But for the most part, these letters are cordial and somewhat stiff one-offs. Yet Mailer is Mailer. I’d be lying to suggest that this book doesn’t have umpteen pleasures to pluck out and roll between your teeth, like seeds from a pomegranate. He battles with publishers over the profanity he wants in his book; he tangles with critics. There are warm letters to his wives and children. Mailer could be blissfully profane, and most of the best one-liners in this book are entirely unpublishable here. There’s a fair amount about sex, one of Mailer’s signal preoccupations. In a 1954 letter to Phyllis Silverman, the sister of his first wife, from whom he was then divorced, he wrote: “As for why I’m getting married, it’s for the same reason everybody does — to have adventures. If there weren’t marriage, there wouldn’t be infidelity, and who could live without the dirty? Millions would commit suicide overnight.” He was a romantic, Mailer. He wore his on-and-off misogyny, his worst quality, like Joe Namath’s fur coat. “The Letters of Norman Mailer” reports on feuds with Gore Vidal, William Styron (a friend whom Mailer banished for reportedly speaking ill of Adele Morales, his second wife) and Arthur Miller. He had short-lived spats with celebrated editors. In 1962, he told William Shawn that his magazine, The New Yorker, was a bore. In 1965, unhappy with how he’d been treated in The New York Review of Books, he told Robert Silvers of that journal that dealing with him was “inching, tedious, and impoverished as spit.” He observed passing whimsies. “As for the twist I don’t dig it,” he wrote in 1962. “I liked it at first but there’s something about it I find satanic. After I see too much of it I begin to get the feeling of bodies writhing in hell.” He dilated on his health. About a battle with a stomach virus, he commented, “I’m beginning to think part of Hemingway’s genius was to command his intestines in strange places.” There is some casually deft literary observation in these letters. In a 1960 letter to Diana Trilling, he argued that many great writers are thus because of their built-in limitations, the way they are hobbled. “Faulkner writes his long sentence because he never really touches what he is about to say and so keeps chasing it; Hemingway writes short because he strangles in a dependent clause; Steinbeck digs into the earth because characters who hold martini glasses make him sweat; Proust spins his wrappings because” a gay man “gets slapped if he says what he thinks.” Mailer mellowed with age. These letters follow him to the end of his life, when arthritis forced him to walk with two canes. About passing 80, he wrote: “One’s mind stays clear (whenever one is not forgetting something) and one’s balance is comic. I can totter like Buster Keaton when I’m cold sober, and skedaddle like Charlie Chaplin the moment I lose my footing.” “Selected Letters of Norman Mailer” is a pile of mostly minor gleanings from a major writer. At its occasional best, you can pay it the compliment that Mailer paid Truman Capote in 1959: “Thank you for your good and properly obscene letter.”
