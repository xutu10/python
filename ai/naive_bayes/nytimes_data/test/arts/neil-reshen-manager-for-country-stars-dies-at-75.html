Neil Reshen, Manager for Country Stars, Dies at 75
Mr. Reshen, who started out doing music executives’ taxes, made deals for Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and others.

Neil Reshen, a New Yorker whose fierce negotiating with record labels helped a couple of twangy Texans named Waylon and Willie become the iconoclastic voices of “outlaw” country music, died on Dec. 6 in the Bronx. He was 75. His daughter Dawn Reshen-Doty said the cause was complications of Alzheimer’s disease. By the early 1970s, Waylon Jennings had grown tired of the constraints of the so-called Nashville Sound — sweet strings, bland themes, hair spray. After 15 years in the music business, his star was fading and he was deep in debt. When he asked his record company for more money and more creative control, it ignored him. Then a friend urged Mr. Jennings to talk to Mr. Reshen, warning that he might not actually like him. Mr. Reshen was not a lawyer, not a certified public account, and he was by no means Southern. He had a funny beard and had studied accounting at City College before working his way into the good graces of music executives and performers — including Ken Glancy, the president of RCA, and Miles Davis during his fusion phase — by doing their income taxes. In time, he began representing a diverse range of artists and entertainers, including Mr. Davis, Frank Zappa, the Velvet Underground and Peter Max. However wary Mr. Jennings may have been, he was quickly convinced after he saw the fearlessness with which Mr. Reshen confronted executives at RCA, the label where he had been under contract. After a few memorable meetings — tense silences, the occasional outburst and well-timed walkouts were among Mr. Reshen’s tactics — Mr. Jennings’s new manager helped him obtain a substantial advance and something perhaps more priceless: artistic freedom. “He was,” Mr. Jennings later wrote, “like a mad dog on a leash.” Over the next several years, Mr. Jennings became a superstar, releasing a string of hit albums, including “Lonesome, On’ry and Mean,” “Honky Tonk Heroes,” “Dreaming My Dreams” (his first No. 1 hit on the country charts, in 1975) and “Ol’ Waylon,” in 1977. Not long after Mr. Reshen began working with Mr. Jennings, he also started managing Mr. Jennings’s good friend, a respected songwriter who had never made it big as a singer: Willie Nelson. He, too, wanted more freedom. The first album Mr. Nelson recorded under a contract that Mr. Reshen helped negotiate with Columbia was called “Red Headed Stranger.” Spare and dark and recorded in just four days in January 1975, the album was not well received by Columbia executives. They delayed its release, proposing changes to make it more marketable. Mr. Jennings, concerned for his friend, joined Mr. Reshen in a meeting with the label — and they both walked out, demanding that the label release the record as it was. Released in May, “Red Headed Stranger” rose to No. 1 on the country charts and No. 28 on the pop charts. Mr. Nelson, too, became a superstar. “There was a time when Neil fed me and Willie, and if it hadn’t been for him, I don’t know what we would have done,” Mr. Jennings wrote in “Waylon: An Autobiography.” “He helped us immeasurably. He got things for us that no country singer had ever gotten before. If we were going to become Outlaws, though we didn’t know that yet, we needed an Outlaw Lawyer, as Willie called him.” There were other hit records, including “Wanted! The Outlaws,” which included Mr. Nelson; Mr. Jennings; Mr. Jennings’s wife,  “By getting RCA to agree to let Waylon do his music on his terms,” Joe Nick Patoski wrote in  But even as the singers became more successful, their relationship with Mr. Reshen deteriorated. In August 1977, federal agents intercepted a package sent from Mr. Reshen’s office to Mr. Jennings. It contained cocaine. Mr. Reshen’s assistant, Mark Rothbaum, served several months in prison. Mr. Reshen and Mr. Jennings were never charged. Dawn Reshen-Coty said that her father had used drugs with Mr. Jennings but that he quit in the late 1970s. Mr. Jennings and Mr. Nelson soon fired Mr. Reshen. Mr. Nelson, who had been frustrated with Mr. Reshen before, accused him of mishandling his money. He also blamed him for some of his well-known tax troubles. Mr. Nelson sued and was then countersued by Mr. Reshen. They reached a settlement out of court that was sealed. Neil Charles Reshen was born on March 3, 1939, in Queens, the oldest of three sons of Philip Reshen and the former Dorothy Niemy. After graduating from City College, he enrolled in law school but did not graduate. In addition to his daughter Dawn, Mr. Reshen’s survivors include another daughter, Amber Bezahler; a grandson; and two brothers, Bruce and Mark. His two marriages ended in divorce. In the 1980s, he moved away from the music business and began representing authors and publishing houses. He also started a company that his daughter now runs, Benay Enterprises, which provides management and business services. After Mr. Rothbaum was released from prison, he began working for Mr. Nelson again, eventually becoming his manager. For several years, he also managed Mr. Jennings, who died in 2002. “Neil was mean,” said Mr. Rothbaum, who continues to work with Mr. Nelson. “If he was holding you over a cliff, he just might let you go. But in fairness, he was a sharp guy.”
