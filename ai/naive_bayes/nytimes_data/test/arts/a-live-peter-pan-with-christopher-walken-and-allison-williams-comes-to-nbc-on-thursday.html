A Live ‘Peter Pan,’ With Christopher Walken and Allison Williams, Comes to NBC on Thursday
NBC is creating a live production of “Peter Pan,” hoping to establish a holiday TV tradition of such shows.

BETHPAGE, N.Y. — Peter Pan’s shadow wasn’t cooperating. The shadow — actually a computerized projection — is one of dozens of complex technical elements intended to boost the wow factor in NBC’s three-hour broadcast of  On a sound stage here, the shadow squatted when Peter crossed his arms, and crossed its arms when Peter squatted. Ms. Williams, with a ponytail and cutlass belt, repeatedly ran through Act I in the Darling nursery, each attempt unfolding smoothly until the shadow made its anarchic appearance. “My shadow’s broken,” Ms. Williams moaned finally to no one in particular, her playful tone not quite concealing her frustration. Directors stared at the recalcitrant stage effect, discussing adjustments that remain a mystery: The set was closed to observers minutes later. Adapted from Jerome Robbins’s 1954 Broadway version of J. M. Barrie’s play, “Peter Pan Live!,” which will be shown on Thursday night, seeks to recapture the ratings magic of  The shadow hiccup, coming as months of rehearsals dwindled down to the final days of fine-tuning, pointed up the technical hurdles facing the principals in Team Pan — the executive producers Neil Meron and Craig Zadan, and the director Rob Ashford — as they mount a follow-up to last year’s uneven but highly rated  That show, the first live broadcast of a musical in decades, was “a great experiment,” Mr. Meron said, but the fantastical “Peter Pan Live!” aims to marry Broadway spectacle with TV wizardry more ambitiously. Unlike “The Sound of Music,” “Peter Pan” will include big dance numbers shot on 360-degree sets, using Steadicams and cranes. In addition to the rebellious shadow, other complicating factors include a live, computer-generated Tinker Bell; moving sets; a contraption-heavy pirate ship; and a talented shaggy mixed breed named Bowdie who plays Nana the dog. (An understudy, Lexie, stands ready.) All told, “Peter Pan” includes roughly 10 times as many technical components as “The Sound of Music,” estimated Derek McLane, the production designer. Prime among them are the elaborate rigs and harnesses that will fly the actors around the studio — always a fraught proposition after  “It’s anxious-making in that it’s a lot for all of us to get right,” he said. The producers are embracing showy theatricality with an eye toward establishing such live productions as a holiday tradition for NBC. The network has already secured the rights to “The Music Man” as its 2015 offering, though it won’t commit “until we see how this one comes off,” said Robert Greenblatt, NBC’s entertainment chairman. “It really is a high-end enterprise,” he said, citing the expense but declining to give specific figures. “It can only be done if the audience is big.” “The Sound of Music” hit that mark, drawing 16.6 million live viewers and a total of 21.8 million within the first week, according to Nielsen, and generating a tsunami of social media commentary and envy among other networks. (Fox has begun planning, at least, for a live  Other factors going for “Peter Pan” include a continuing cultural fascination with the story — the  Ms. Williams said: “I know people will watch for worst-case scenarios. Mere centuries ago, we used to watch people get eaten by lions in coliseums.” She added, “That’s totally O.K., just as long as they’re watching.” What “Peter Pan” lacks is a star of Ms. Underwood’s magnitude, with millions of loyal fans to stack the deck. It’s unclear whether the relatively minuscule audience for Ms. Williams’s “Girls” on HBO will turn out for an earnest musical the way Ms. Underwood’s country music devotees apparently did. Ms. Williams, 26, the daughter of the “NBC Nightly News” anchor Brian Williams, performed in plenty of musical theater in high school and college but has never done so professionally — she came to the producers’ attention via a film project. That said, her lovely singing voice might surprise viewers who know her only as the bottled-up Marnie on “Girls.” In rehearsals, she also displayed a convincingly boyish gait and British accent as Peter, an object of fascination for Ms. Williams for as long as she can remember. In July she posted  “The first day of rehearsal, I thought, ‘This is someone who knows this character,’ ” said Mr. Ashford, the director and choreographer. For Mr. Walken, 71, who worked with Mr. Meron and Mr. Zadan in their movie adaptation of “Hairspray,” this production offers another rare opportunity to indulge his  Mr. Walken is known for intense portrayals in films like “The Deer Hunter,” but he came up in musical theater. (When he was 20, he appeared with an even younger Liza Minnelli in the Off Broadway musical revival of “Best Foot Forward,” and he met his wife in a touring production of “West Side Story.”) During a break from sword-fighting practice in a Hell’s Kitchen studio — “I’m not very good at it; I’m sort of scared,” he said — Mr. Walken suggested that being nervous about the big night suited him. “I’m very nervous about everything,” he said. “I find it’s useful to be that way. You’re looking behind your back, you’re watching. You’re trying to have backup plans and contingencies. Try to have yourself covered, you know?” In conversation, Mr. Walken speaks softly, evincing little of the halting diction and strained vowels that have inspired a million overwrought impressions. But Christian Borle, a stage veteran who plays Hook’s sidekick, Smee (as well as Mr. Darling, opposite Kelli O’Hara as his wife), said viewers could expect a classically Walken-esque performance. “He knows who he is, and he plays on his own image in a really, really smart way,” Mr. Borle said. How the portrayal will fit within the magic-realism aura that the “Peter Pan” producers are striving for remains to be seen. On the set, the only nod toward reality is the homey Darling nursery, which breaks apart so that harnessed actors can soar above a miniaturized London and into a Seussian Neverland. The producers opted for four-wall sets instead of the open rooms of a classic proscenium arrangement, to allow for more dynamic camera movements. But what stands out is the presumable difficulty of executing acrobatic dance steps while dodging Steadicam operators on an ersatz pirate ship. “I keep saying, ‘Wow, are we really sure we can pull all this off?’ ” Mr. Greenblatt said. “I hope nothing goes wrong, but if it does, I think it will add to the fun of it.” Mr. Walken had a slightly different view: “Like anything in life, but especially in show business, you need some luck.”
