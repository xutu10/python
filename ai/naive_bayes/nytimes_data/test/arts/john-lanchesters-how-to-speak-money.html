John Lanchester’s ‘How to Speak Money’
The British writer John Lanchester demystifies the financial world in “How to Speak Money: What the Money People Say — And What It Really Means.”
===
Do you know the difference between “fiscal” and “monetary”? Don’t feel bad. Neither did the British writer John Lanchester when he began work a decade or so ago on  “I got a first-class degree from Oxford,” Mr. Lanchester said the other day. “I worked for The London Review of Books for a decade; and I had heard the terms ‘fiscal’ and ‘monetary’ maybe 10,000 times each, and I didn’t know what they meant. I kind of vaguely sort-of maybe half-knew, and that was embarrassing. I didn’t know what they meant until I was in my late 40s.” Mr. Lanchester, now 52, was speaking over lunch at Delmonico’s, an old-school restaurant of dark wood paneling, hushed conversation and big slabs of meat in the heart of the New York financial district. Outside, the stock market was having what appeared to be some kind of seizure. If you were just an innocent bystander, so to speak, it was hard to understand what was happening, other than that it was not good at all. “There is a gigantic gap between them and us — people who understand these forces and this language, and the rest of us,” Mr. Lanchester said. So, back around the time of the 2008 crisis, he embarked on a self-taught immersion course in the language and mechanics of money. “The first obstacle, and the main obstacle, was the words themselves,” he said. “It’s embarrassing to admit if you literally don’t know what a word means.” So he began to ask and ask, and ask again. He shares his findings in “How to Speak Money: What the Money People Say — And What It Really Means,” out this week from W. W. Norton & Company. In it, he explains some of the barriers to understanding, lays out the case for financial literacy and then provides an essential glossary of terms for those who would like to achieve this happy state. Here we find easy-ish concepts (amortization) harder ones (credit default swap, high-frequency trading) and ones we know are super-important in some complicated but confusing way (Libor: the London Interbank Offered Rate). And yes, also included are those pesky terms fiscal and monetary. For the record: “ ‘Fiscal’ means to do with tax and spending, and it is controlled by the government; ‘monetary’ means to do with interest rates, and it is controlled by the central bank,” he writes. Mr. Lanchester, who lives in London, grew up in Hong Kong and moved to England in 1979, when it was a different place entirely, dozy and far poorer. He might seem an unlikely person to serve as financial-concept translator to the world’s liberal-arts majors. Tweedy, bookish and soft-spoken, he is the author of four much-praised novels, including the deliciously creepy “Debt to Pleasure,” about a murderous epicure;  But Mr. Lanchester wanted to put the research he did for “Capital” to good use, and he did not want it to clog up that novel or any others. (He is about to start work on a new one.) “The thing about research is that you end up using it whether you should or not,” he said. “If I’m not careful, I’ll have scenes in a novel where, you know, ‘As Nigel looked out his office window towards the lights of Canary Wharf in the distance, he struggled to remember the definition of a collateralized debt obligation.’ ” So in 2010 he published “I.O.U.: Why Everyone Owes Everyone and No One Can Pay,” as succinct an account of the world’s financial mess as you are likely to find. The British critic Tim Adams said in an email that “along with Michael Lewis, I think John is the best we have at describing how Wall Street and the square mile of the City of London hijacked the world’s economy to feed itself,” adding that “his writing may have the economic erudition of The Financial Times or The Wall Street Journal, but his satirical intent quietly laces every sentence and observation.” Mr. Lanchester then began writing about finance and business for The London Review of Books — where he is known, Mr. Adams said, as “the pre-eminent polymath” in a field crowded with them — and found he was suddenly in demand as an explicator and demystifier in the news media and as a public speaker. After he wrote “I.O.U.” (British title: “Whoops!”), he said, “I thought: ‘That’s it. I’m never writing about money ever again. I’m done.’ ” But he found could not get away from it. “As tabloid journalists say in Britain, no is just an emotional way of saying yes,” Mr. Lanchester said. The language of money is full not just of off-putting aphorisms, incomprehensible jargon and obscure technical terms, but also of what Mr. Lanchester calls reversification, in which words mean something suspiciously like the opposite of what they ought to mean. For example, you might think “securitization” would have “something to do with security or reliability,” Mr. Lanchester writes. But you would be wrong. It describes “the process of turning something — and in the world of finance it can be pretty much anything — into a security,” he writes. That is, a “financial instrument that can be traded as an asset,” he continues. “You’ll never find a memo where they say, ‘Hee hee hee, let’s use all these complicated words that civilians can’t understand,” Mr. Lanchester said. “Sometimes there is intent, and sometimes there isn’t, but it’s moot. The crucial thing is the effect on outsiders, which is systematically excluding.” Mr. Lanchester said he believes that even the scared and the clueless have the capacity to understand financial language, if they can just get over their psychological problems. “Most people’s default setting is that they would prefer never to think about money,” he went on. He likened it to a “Peanuts” cartoon in which Charlie Brown talks wistfully about being a child in the back seat of a car and not having to worry about anything because “your parents are in the front seat, and they do all the worrying.” “The trouble is,” Mr. Lanchester said, “we’re in the front seat of the car.”
