Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line Have New Albums
Jason Aldean’s “Old Boots, New Dirt” moves squarely beyond his rowdy days, and Florida Georgia Line’s “Anything Goes” is sweet and featherlight.

It takes nine songs for Jason Aldean, on his new album, to get to the one about trucks. In the current climate, this is an act of extreme restraint. Country music is teeming with man-children these days — they want to ride in their pickups, blast outlaw country and hip-hop, maybe smoke a little something that, depending on which state you’re in, may or may not be legal. Mr. Aldean has been working this turf for almost a decade, long enough to remember what it was like to be unfashionable, and now long enough to go back out of fashion. His impressive sixth album, “Old Boots, New Dirt” (Broken Bow), came out this week, and it finds Mr. Aldean moving squarely beyond his rowdy days. He has ceded that territory to the many who have followed in his path. Several of the ingredients Mr. Aldean helped country swallow make up the improbably successful duo Florida Georgia Line (Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley). Their tepidly beautiful song “Cruise” was one of the most popular country songs of the last few years, and their saccharine second album, “Anything Goes” (Republic Nashville), will be released next week. What Mr. Aldean and Florida Georgia Line share are largely empty lyrics about love and romance and good times and bad times. But where Florida Georgia Line focuses on the party, Mr. Aldean has his sights on whom you leave the party with. Time has granted Mr. Aldean the veneer of traditionalism — he is a consistent, compelling stoic. On his new album he fully emerges as a purveyor of love songs, his true destiny ever since it became clear that he wasn’t meant to be the redneck revivalist he was initially pitched as. Instead, he excels at songs like “Show You Off,” about romantic fealty, or “Tryin’ to Love Me,” about confronting weakness and misjudgment: “Didn’t think those tears were real/I thought you were just trying to play me/I just stood there and let ’em fall.” Mr. Aldean is a pugnacious singer who hides his power, never wanting to be pegged as a technician. When he’s not puffing out his chest, he can sound lazy, as on “Burnin’ It Down,” on which the words sometimes seem to be seeping out of the corner of his mouth. But his porky voice resists nuance — “Two Night Town,” with its air of desperation and sin, could be a classic outlaw song but sounds much like the elegant “Tryin’ to Love Me.” Poignancy is slightly ill-fitting on him, although he’s been capable of it before, as on the early career single “Why.” That song’s pathos is echoed here on “Too Fast”: “I wanna be the man that you thought I was/I wanna be the man that made you fall in love.” Even his truck song, “If My Truck Could Talk,” isn’t really that, taking the conceit of a truck’s durability and turning it on its head: If my truck could talk, I’d have to yank out all the wires, Pour on the gas, set it on fire, anything to shut it up. It’s been good to me, but it knows too much, it’s seen it all. I’d have to find a riverbank and roll it off. In, say, Blake Shelton’s hands, this would have been a comedic song, but again, Mr. Aldean’s voice, square and true, saps the song of its essential humor. But Mr. Aldean’s shtick is effective — his sturdy voice, paired with production that has more in common with sensual 1980s hard rock than modern country, makes for uncommonly brawny country music. “Just Gettin’ Started,” “Gonna Know We Were Here,” “Sweet Little Somethin’ ”: Mr. Aldean’s songs get by with muscle, not concept. By comparison, Florida Georgia Line is a literal breeze, with songs that land like feathers. “Anything Goes” doesn’t pack quite the raw shock of that duo’s 2012 debut album, “Here’s to the Good Times.” That album posited that the gap between country and hip-hop was not so vast (something Mr. Aldean had already demonstrated on his single “Dirt Road Anthem”) and that country’s early 2010s move toward soft rock could be modernized. Hence, “I’m gonna wear my flip-flops/and I’m gonna play some flip cup/and rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger” — this is what Mr. Hubbard sings at the beginning of “Sun Daze,” one of the thinnest songs on the new album. Mr. Hubbard is a quick-tongued singer whose style has plenty of overlap with plain-old rapping — he squeezes two or three times the number of syllables into a bar that Mr. Aldean would. That means while Mr. Aldean always appears to be pondering something, Mr. Hubbard rarely comes to a full stop. On “Smile,” it’s an assonant list: “Got on my smell-good, got a bottle of feel-good/Shined up my wheels good, you’re looking real good.” On “Like You Ain’t Even Gone,” it’s rapid scene-setting: “I still go riding around town with the windows down and your feet up on my dash/Got your Rays on and my hat’s back and we’re feeling cool as cash.” Whereas Mr. Aldean is ready to ditch his truck, Florida Georgia Line is still revving up. The road more traveled is the one for them.
