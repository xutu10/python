During the 1970s, when lots of jazz musicians were influenced by John Coltrane’s meticulous and ecstatic small-group language, the saxophonist Azar Lawrence was steeped in it, playing in bands led by Coltrane’s drummer, Elvin Jones, and his pianist, McCoy Tyner. Mr. Lawrence was in his early 20s back then, understood to be one of the best young musicians on the scene, but he didn’t follow a straight line through jazz.

He’s come back over the last decade, recently with an East Coast band including the pianist Benito Gonzalez and the drummer Jeff Watts. This Tuesday happens to be the 50th anniversary of the recording of Coltrane’s album “A Love Supreme,” and Mr. Lawrence’s group — with the bassist Reggie Workman, a Coltrane-band alumnus — will play selections.
