Stephen Costello and Tamara Wilson Show Opposing Approaches
The Met’s recent performances of “La Traviata” and “Aida” showcased both the potential pitfalls and the triumphs that await young Americans singing Verdi.
===
Young American opera singers have long faced the same bum rap as some other American products. They’ve been thought to be well tooled but inauthentic, genial but ultimately impersonal. While they’re as well trained as any musicians in the world, their smooth versatility is said to come across as anonymous onstage. There are ample exceptions to prove the limits of this mixed reputation, yet it persists. And in the rising tenor  While Mr. Costello was supposed to sing Alfredo in “La Traviata” for the first time at the Met on Dec. 11, he was suddenly struck with an unexplained illness that evening, after the conductor, Marco Armiliato, had taken the podium but before the music had begun. Francesco Demuro eventually stepped in, and the  Mr. Costello’s condition evidently passed, and he sang his four remaining scheduled performances, the last of which was Saturday. (Mr. Demuro, as previously planned, has taken over the role of Alfredo through Jan. 24.) Mr. Costello’s voice has clarity, fluidity and ease through its range. At the high end, the tone takes on an appealingly grainy, subtle shimmer, like the metallic halo of sound that remains as a gong finishes ringing. The performance was accomplished — and blank. And in no repertory is that kind of polished facelessness as great a liability as it is in Verdi. His operas obviously ask for accurate vocalism, but pleasant singing will take you only so far if it doesn’t seem to be permeated by emotional — perhaps even moral — truth. In the first act, Mr. Costello’s phrasing during “Un dì, felice” was so square that you wondered why Violetta was even attracted to Alfredo. His surging aria “De’ miei bollenti spiriti” lacked spirit or flair, and he revealed little of the character’s shock and sense of disgrace later in the second act. Throughout the opera, Mr. Costello’s voice was penetrating but without personality. As Alfredo’s father, the young American baritone Quinn Kelsey suffered from a version of the same dichotomy. He sang with booming, round, confident tone and radiated a general vagueness. The Met’s stark Willy Decker production isn’t easy on the men, focusing the audience’s sympathies on Violetta (here the bright-voiced, affecting Marina Rebeka), but that fails to explain why both Germonts, father and son, were so sonorously cipher-like. I was left feeling a bit down about the state of young American Verdi singing, but some of my hope returned after Monday evening’s performance of “Aida.” While the Met’s revival was a snooze when it opened in  Much of the shift seems attributable to a change in the title role, which is now being sung, in a notable Met debut, by the American soprano  Ms. Wilson’s voice is most arresting in the laserlike authority of her high notes, but she softens the steel for sensitive moments, as when she dreams of escape with Radames in the third act. Her basic sound is more useful than resplendent, but she takes advantage of that, coming across as straightforward and sincere, as in her intimate, almost offhand “O patria mia.” Her voice blooms with her palpable involvement in her own story: Her singing is urgent, her physical performance restrained yet powerful. Perhaps most important, Ms. Wilson partners excitingly with her colleagues, including the mezzo Violeta Urmana, a former Met Aida and now a self-possessed Amneris. These two women and the resonant baritone George Gagnidze (Amonasro) are the newcomers in a cast that still features, from October, the impressive basses Dmitry Belosselskiy (Ramfis) and Soloman Howard (the King) and the tenor Marcello Giordani as Radames. Even when Mr. Giordani is effective — in his natural phrasing and his indefatigable high register — it is despite large swaths of his voice that sound tattered. And while Mr. Armiliato, conducting both this revival and “La Traviata,” kept things moving briskly, the approach stinted the grandeur and atmosphere of the public scenes. Still, the performance, engaging and poignant, ended up feeling like more than the sum of its parts. Not least, the Met has unveiled a young American who sings Verdi with a passion that surpasses stereotype.
