Near midnight on Tuesday at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, three women tap-danced as the floor beneath them shifted. The dancing surface was three small wooden platforms. These were laid contiguously, but the force of footwork kept spreading them apart. The more challenging variable, though, was musical. For this was a tribute to the great and iconoclastic jazz singer  The tribute, which continues through Saturday, was organized by one of the dancers, Michela Marino Lerman. In recent years, Ms. Lerman has shown admirable tenacity in getting herself booked into jazz clubs, a natural home for her art that bookers too rarely recognize as such.
