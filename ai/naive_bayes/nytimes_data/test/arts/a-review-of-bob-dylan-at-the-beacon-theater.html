A Review of Bob Dylan at the Beacon Theater
Mr. Dylan has replaced the fluidity and arrogance of youth with a more genuine, lived-in sense that he has nothing to lose and no one but himself to please.

The latest stretch of  It’s a loyalty test, a calmly defiant stand, a flinty cackle and a mustering of Mr. Dylan’s current resources — particularly his 73-year-old voice, which is filled with gravel but can still find clarity when he chooses. The concert was an unflinching yet nonchalant survey of personal, societal and physical devastation. In an unusual year for Mr. Dylan’s mercurial performing career, he has been sticking to a tour set list (in two LP-length segments with an intermission) that has changed by very few songs since October 2013. The concert opened with “Things Have Changed,” his Oscar-winning song from 2000, played faster and more urgently than its recorded version, and it followed through on that song’s core contradiction. “I used to care, but things have changed,” Mr. Dylan sang, yet the verses showed him anything but detached. The rest of the concert was a sequence of grim tidings punctuated by fleeting glimpses of love. Since the set list concentrates on Mr. Dylan’s music since the late 1990s with only two songs from his 1960s repertory — “She Belongs to Me” and “Blowin’ in the Wind” — and two more from the 1975 album “Blood on the Tracks,” it’s no nostalgic oldies show. But Mr. Dylan has every right to not look back. The songs he has released since his mid-50s are powerful, mysterious, down-home jeremiads with bitter bravado and backhanded humor. Mortality, social collapse, disaster, betrayal and the wreckage of love are sketched over Chicago blues, old-timey picking and honky-tonk country. Mr. Dylan has replaced the fluidity and arrogance of youth with a more genuine, lived-in sense that he has nothing to lose and no one but himself to please. He doesn’t soften what he sees; he inhabits it, baleful and acute. Mr. Dylan, who forbids photography at his concerts, wore the kind of roving gambler outfit he has regularly sported in recent years: a long coat with piping on the pockets and matching stripes on the pants, and a flat wide-brimmed hat. His band had gray suits. He didn’t speak between songs or name his musicians; he kept a dourly straight face. The band, rootsy and stealthily inventive, deserved an introduction: Charlie Sexton and Stu Kimball on guitars; Donnie Herron on banjo, fiddle and steel guitar; Tony Garnier on bass and George Receli on drums. The costuming indicated that it was a show, while the showmanship was mostly in the music. It was in the glances between band members as they cruised the byways of Americana and in the way Mr. Dylan applied his voice. He has always wandered between speech and melody, and on Friday night each song had a strategy. In “She Belongs to Me,” which has become a steadfast march, he recast the tune with octave-wide descents, plummeting into the woman’s control. In “Long and Wasted Years,” a catalog of separations and iffy reunions delivered over a casually descending guitar line, Mr. Dylan was like a carnival barker, rattling off recriminations as if they had grown all too familiar; he put a hand on his hip. The bruised and wounded “Love Sick” was a succession of desperate shouts. Yet in “Forgetful Heart,” Mr. Dylan cleared much of the rasp from his voice to croon the song, sustaining the melody as the lyrics detailed deep loneliness. He sang about natural disaster in “High Water (for Charley Patton),” economic pressures in “Workingman’s Blues #2” and legacies of violence and treachery in two long, patiently hypnotic songs, “Pay in Blood” and “Scarlet Town.” Happier thoughts and memories of love — all spiked with warnings — arrived with old-fashioned swing in “Duquesne Whistle” and in “Spirit on the Water,” in the shuffle of “Soon After Midnight;” as a foreboding Mardi Gras mambo in “Beyond Here Lies Nothin,’ ”; and as a country waltz in “Waiting for You,” a Dylan song from the 2002 soundtrack to “Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.” The old blues attitude, of surviving the worst and expecting more of it, was in the songs. During “Spirit on the Water,” which veers between love and suspicion over an easy shuffle, an audience member was intercepted as he tried to rush the stage. Mr. Dylan, at the piano, glanced at the altercation and made his delivery even more casually conversational, like an unruffled trouper who had already seen it all. His last encore, a relatively recent addition to the set, was a song he gleaned from Frank Sinatra’s 1960s catalog: “Stay With Me,” written by Carolyn Leigh and Jerome Moross. (Mr. Dylan may release an album of songs recorded by Mr. Sinatra in 2015.) “Stay With Me” is a hymnlike apology to a lover or God or both. Mr. Dylan sang it forthrightly and even humbly; he was atoning, but he was braced for new troubles. Mr. Dylan performs at the Beacon Theater on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
