Around Town Holiday Tree Lightings and Celebrations A stage at 63rd Street will feature performances by Arlo Guthrie and cast members from “Kinky Boots” on Broadway, including Billy Porter, who won a Tony Award last year for his leading role as Lola. Dishes from nearby restaurants can be sampled from 6 to 8:30 p.m., for $1 to $4; more details: winterseve.org. On Tuesday at 7 p.m., an interactive tree-lighting ceremony — dedicated to eradicating mother-to-child H.I.V. transmission — is planned in Bryant Park at Avenue of the Americas and 42nd Street. The event will help promote the work of RED, an advocacy group seeking to raise awareness and money to help eliminate AIDS. Entertainment, with music by Ingrid Michaelson and others, begins at 6 p.m. and the holiday shops will be open as well, top; wintervillage.org. Spectacle and charity; the best of the holidays.
