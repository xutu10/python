Jon Hamm Stars in ‘Black Mirror’ Christmas Special
“Black Mirror,” the British anthology drama that mines cautionary, “Twilight Zone”-style narratives from our obsessions with gadgetry, returns to American television on Thursday.

Picture, if you will, a world where our digital devices seem eerily alive; where technology lets us block unwanted people not only from our social media streams but from our eyes and ears; and where the maladroit can receive stealthy, real-time pickup and dating advice from debonair coaches resembling the “Mad Men” star Jon Hamm. This is the very near future imagined by  Beneath that seemingly cheerful title lurks an ambiguous premise that begins with Mr. Hamm and Rafe Spall as men who find themselves in a cabin for unknown reasons. A sinister episode full of the series’s trademark twists and turns and a macabre sense of humor unfolds. Mr. Hamm explained in an interview that “Black Mirror” aims a distorted lens at society to show “where it’s probably going, which is further — and maybe further than we want.” While “Black Mirror,” which is shown on Channel 4 in Britain, is often skeptical of phenomena that spread rapidly and unpredictably, it has also benefited from virality. The series, which had its first American showings on the satellite broadcast service DirecTV (which will also first show the “White Christmas” special on its Audience channel), has recently been added to Netflix’s on-demand library. It now has its best chance to infiltrate the cultural consciousness of America, where its absurdist explorations of progress gone amok will resonate just as loudly. As Charlie Brooker, the creator of “Black Mirror,” explained, what seems to unite people these days is the clumsy way we adapt to new technology and media. “We’re like people who are playing a driving video game for the first time, and we’re smashing into the walls left and right,” Mr. Brooker said in an interview. “As we get better as a species, we’ll master it. But at the moment we’re colliding with things all the time.” Mr. Brooker, a British writer, producer and columnist  He also wrote a hit British horror mini-series,  For a follow-up, Mr. Brooker said he wanted to try his version of a series like Rod Serling’s “Twilight Zone,” which offered parables about racism, McCarthyism and nuclear paranoia, concealed in the garb of traditional science fiction. The logical 21st-century update would take aim at our relationship with technology, but Mr. Brooker said he wanted to “deliberately unnerve the viewers” rather than scold them. “Most dramas tend to reassure the viewer, I think,” he said. “Even crime procedurals are really about the good guy catching the bad guy.” What he wanted to create, he said, was “an anthology that would potentially unsettle, and speak about things other than ‘Isn’t crime terrible?’ and ‘Isn’t the class divide an awful thing?’ ” “Black Mirror,” which had its first three-episode season in 2011, gained attention as much for its use of actors like Rory Kinnear (“Skyfall”) and Jessica Brown Findlay (“Downton Abbey”) as for its provocative premises. Its debut episode, “The National Anthem,” focused on a kidnapping plot in which the captor of a royal family member said he would release her only if the prime minister (Mr. Kinnear) performed an act of bestiality on live television. “Often with ‘Black Mirror,’ the ideas really make me laugh,” said Mr. Brooker, who wrote that episode. “That probably doesn’t come across in the final show.” Mr. Spall said that the format of “Black Mirror,” in which each episode offers a self-contained story, was a welcome corrective to a television environment overrun by serialized narratives. “Starting a new one can take such a huge amount of energy,” Mr. Spall said. “You go: ‘Am I going to start this series? Am I going to watch the entire back catalog of “The Sopranos”? God, this is going to be three months of my life, gone.’ ” Even before “Black Mirror” was shown in the United States, Mr. Brooker said he began hearing from Hollywood types who were finding it on shady torrent sites “or getting surreptitious DVD copies or whatever.” Mr. Hamm (who watched the show legally on DirecTV) said he was introduced to it by the “Saturday Night Live” alumnus Bill Hader. When he was approached to star in the “Black Mirror” special, Mr. Hamm said he did not have to worry about when or if it would reach American audiences, or what size audience would see it. As he has learned from his experiences on “Mad Men,” Mr. Hamm said, “No one cares about ratings anymore.” “The stigma of not being on network television, which was the gold standard forever, is just obliterated,” he said. With the curtain about to come down on “Mad Men,” Mr. Hamm has been appearing in offbeat television roles, playing  “It becomes simply about content,” Mr. Hamm said. “If enough people are in your ear — or your virtual ear — about a specific piece of content,” audiences will seek it out. Not that Mr. Hamm is using social media to engage in these discussions, but as “Black Mirror” has taught him, he said, “It’s not going away.” Nor is it worth his energy to complain about it, he said. “I just end up sounding like the old man on the lawn, shaking his fist at those dang teenagers.” Mr. Spall, who admitted to checking his email “100 times a day,” said that expanding his Internet presence any further would be a devastating mistake. “For me, that would be like saying, ‘Hmm, I think I’m going to take up heroin,’ ” he explained. “ ‘I’ve never tried it before, but I think I’m going to get into smack.’ ”
