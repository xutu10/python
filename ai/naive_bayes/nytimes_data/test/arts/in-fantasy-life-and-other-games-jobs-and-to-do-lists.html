In Fantasy Life and Other Games, Jobs and To-Do Lists
In the video game Fantasy Life, the world is imperiled, but you still need to get a job, remember to pick up milk and do other chores.

I need to go to the grocery store to buy some cereal and orange juice. I need to tie up some papers for recycling. And I have an article to write. That’s my to-do list in real life. In  That’s some fantasy life I’m having. The fantasy that the game’s title alludes to is probably the genre kind about knights, dragons and wizards. The world is imperiled in this game. There are evil forces, a princess and so on. But the other fantasy here is perversely quotidian: It’s about getting a job, one of 12 available, from cook to alchemist to tailor to mercenary. It’s also about doing chores (up to 30 at a time) and getting stuff for the people you meet. Those who don’t play video games might be surprised by how common the assigned tedium of Fantasy Life is across the medium. They might be shocked at how often games slip from feeling fun to feeling like work. Fantasy Life is explicit about it, but modern video games are full of menial tasks. They’re programmed to present virtual to-do lists. Games as cinema? Games as art? Consider games as a second job — one you pay for. Take  There is a long tradition in games of presenting actual work as fun. Zone a city as an urban planner in Sim City and tweak tax policy for pleasure. Diner Dash turned waiting tables into a strategy game; Cooking Mama did something similar with swiftly preparing meals. Recent, daring games like as Cart Life and Papers, Please intentionally convey the misery of unpleasant jobs to make a point. Grander games like Dragon Age that are less explicitly about work, however, are often the ones that can feel like chores. They ask so much of players at once that they risk failing to please or provoke by numbing them with an endless list of menial, if optional, tasks. Video games can give players chores, but it’s worth asking what they gain from doing them. In Dragon Age, Fantasy Life or many big games like them, players are essentially multitasking as they operate a game — a computer program — that can count their actions and offer commensurate rewards. Collecting all that seaweed, for example, can get you a potion that’s all the more useful for staying alive while fighting a world-ending monster. Part of the fantasy is that games are places of meritocracy. Do these tasks, no matter how banal, and the game world will reward you. That’s an appealing distinction from how the real world works. Still, I recall the twinkle I saw in the eye of the game designer Patrice Désilets  But video games are usually meant to entertain, and so the actual doing of any in-game task ought to be fun. We shouldn’t need an in-game paycheck for our labor. The abundance of so many rewards for so many tasks in games implies that there are too many things to do that just aren’t enjoyable. That brings me back to Fantasy Life, which initially struck me as the most frank and yet most tedious collection of video game chores yet. As I played, however, I discovered a twist. As a carpenter, I was bored, but as a lumberjack I was energized. I was thrilled to search for rare trees to chop. I was excited to realize that I could use those logs to make tools as a carpenter. I realized all 12 jobs were linked, and I recognized a new fantasy — one in which I am every member of the work force, where I depend on me, where I can juggle a dozen professions and make myself a better suit of armor because of it. A single job might be real life. But 12 jobs that feed into one another? That might be video games’ weirdest and most enticing work fantasy yet.
