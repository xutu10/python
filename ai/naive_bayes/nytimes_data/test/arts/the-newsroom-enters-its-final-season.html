‘The Newsroom’ Enters Its Final Season
As “The Newsroom” begins its final season, its journalistic warriors grapple with real-world events and a takeover threat.

“The Newsroom” begins its truncated, six-episode final season on  The First Amendment warriors of ACN are last to the story because of their leaders’ old-school reluctance to use Twitter as a source. In part, this looks like a statement of principle from Mr. Sorkin. The new season, three episodes of which were sent to critics, intensifies his general critique of social media as a tool for gathering and distributing news, with page clicks driving news judgment. (He hedges his bets by having his protagonist, the “News Night” anchor Will McAvoy, appear sympathetic to the new ways.) But the journalists’ hesitation also makes sense dramatically, because they’re still feeling the effects of their colossal blunder in Season 2, when they broadcast a false report accusing the American military of using sarin gas. It was a mistake for them and for “The Newsroom” — the show stopped making sense late in Season 2, when the whole news crew offered to resign but no one ended up leaving. The show doesn’t have to be scrupulously realistic about the news business, but some things — like falsely accusing the Marines and then not firing  Season 3 begins with both ACN and Mr. Sorkin in a tamped-down, focused mode. That’s generally a good thing. Some unhealthy story lines have been cauterized — in particular, the junior producer Maggie Jordan (Alison Pill) has apparently gotten over the trauma of her deadly assignment in Africa. And after the lessons of the Boston coverage are dispensed in Episode 1, Mr. Sorkin moves the action, entertainingly, into conspiracy-thriller territory. A whistle-blower contacts the young tech whiz Neal Sampat (Dev Patel) and delivers 27,000 government documents. The source is introduced Edward Snowden-style, with blind emails about encryption, but is really the anti-Snowden, determined to remain anonymous. This allows Mr. Sorkin to make the story about risking jail to protect the source, rather than spending months vetting classified documents. What’s missing in Season 3, so far, is Mr. Sorkin’s romantic side — his ability to go big with a certain kind of male-centric, over-the-top-but-still-charming screwball passion. The bedrock of “The Newsroom” early on was the curdled romance between Will and his producer, MacKenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer). That has run its course — in Season 3 they’re planning a wedding — and the rom-com duties have been shifted to Don (the excellent Thomas Sadoski) and Sloan (Olivia Munn). Their scenes don’t sweep you away, but some are very funny. Also funny is a scene in which Will’s interview with a climate-change pessimist, slyly played by Paul Lieberstein of “The Office,” goes awry, and any scene involving Jane Fonda as the network’s owner, who’s fighting off a hostile takeover. Watching Mr. Sorkin’s “Newsroom” is a little like watching the news — if you don’t like one segment, the odds are pretty good that there’s a better one right after it.
