Soledad Barrio and Noche Flamenca Explore Sophocles’ Drama
In Noche Flamenca’s latest adventure, “Antigona,” at the Joyce Theater, the company travels to ancient Greece.

There are dancers, and there are spellbinding creatures for whom movement emanates from deep within the body and erupts like a volcano. Soledad Barrio is such a force. Beating out rhythms with rattling heels and swirling her arms overhead with emphatic bearing, she leaves one world for another. In her latest adventure, seen Wednesday at the Joyce Theater, her company,  “ Yet this production, shown in seemingly random excerpt form, is confounding. While there is an admirable simplicity to the staging — singers appear in square spotlights, and there is no set — the work continues on a meandering, melodramatic path in which flamenco, at times, feels like style instead of substance. David Thomas, a hip-hop dancer, plays Eteocles, Antigone’s other brother. In the fight between Polyneices, performed by flamenco dancer Salví Rosino, and Eteocles, the brothers charge at each other to the sound of an electric guitar. Mr. Rosino’s sharp feet and rigid arms contrast with Mr. Thomas’s silkier torso and toes that prick at the floor in soft sneakers, but the battle, dance or otherwise, is as tepid as their take on slow-motion jabs. Exuding grief, Ms. Barrio’s raw edge is ferociously intact, but the storytelling grows clunkier as a unison chorus — too reminiscent of Martha Graham — becomes more foreground than background. Even the dancing of Juan Ogalla as the furious Haemon — Antigone’s fiancé and Creonte’s son — can’t shift the momentum. A better display of Mr. Ogalla’s aggressive, robust dancing can be found in his “Alegrías” solo in the program’s second half. As the company opts for more standard flamenco fare, the fog lifts, and Mr. Ogalla displays his extraordinary prowess while cutting a defiant profile or crossing his feet briskly in a blast of percussive beats. In “Solea,” Ms. Barrio’s solo turn, she takes control of the stage: Lurching forward and leaning to the side, she sweeps her body down like a wave only to land upright, illustrating how dance and music bleed into each other. In the number’s final moments, the chorus from “Antigona” returns to surround her. Music is replaced by the sound of footsteps and breath, and Ms. Barrio, crouching and ravaged, reaches her arms forward, fingers curling, as if searching for a way out.
