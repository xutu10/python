Oscar Schafer on His Coming Role at Philharmonic
Oscar S. Schafer, who will take over from Gary W. Parr, will become the New York Philharmonic’s board chief at a critical juncture.

Oscar S. Schafer had been sponsoring the New York Philharmonic’s free parks concerts for several years when he tried something a little different at the start of a concert one sultry summer night in 2013: He donned a white jacket, picked up a baton and led the orchestra in the overture from Bizet’s “Carmen” — the opera, he explained, at which he had met his wife. “It was one of the highlights of my life,” Mr. Schafer said of his conducting stint. He was modest about his skills: “They could play with me, or without me.” Now Mr. Schafer is taking on an even more challenging role with the Philharmonic: He will become the chairman of its board early next year, as the ensemble reaches a critical juncture. The orchestra, which has run deficits for a decade, is about to embark on a major fund-raising campaign aiming to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to build up its endowment fund and to pay for the long-awaited renovation of Avery Fisher Hall, its Lincoln Center home. The orchestra’s deficit for the 2013-14 season was $2.1 million on a budget of $71.9 million, according to its most recent annual report, down from $6.1 million the previous season. Orchestra officials attributed the smaller deficit to better ticket sales, cost-cutting measures and strong fund-raising — but also to the board’s decision to use more of its endowment fund to pay for current operations, a practice that has proved risky for other arts institutions. New York City Opera  The Philharmonic, whose endowment fund climbed in value to $200 million last season, took a more modest percentage: It spent 6.75 percent of its endowment, up from 5 percent in the 2012-13 season, which is generally considered more prudent. Matthew VanBesien, its president and executive director, said that starting in the current season, the board had decided to reduce the rate of endowment spending by a quarter of a percentage point a year. “It will come down as we raise endowment funds over the next several years,” he said. The orchestra, which hopes Mr. Schafer, who made his fortune in hedge funds and is the chairman of Rivulet Capital, a private investment firm, said he believed that the excitement generated by the Philharmonic’s plans to renovate its hall would help inspire donors. “At the end of the day, the product we have is fabulous,” said Mr. Schafer, 75, who played classical records on the Harvard radio station when he was a student there. “So, despite the fact that there are competing places that are trying to raise money, New York City is a great place, and I think it’s probably, by far, the most generous place in the world. And I think that by getting a new building, we’re going to create a buzz.” Mr. Schafer, who was elected on Thursday, will succeed Gary W. Parr, the chairman since 2009. Mr. Parr said he was pleased that during his tenure, the orchestra established residencies in Shanghai and elsewhere for it to play and teach; restarted plans for the renovation of Avery Fisher; brought in Mr. VanBesien as president; and stepped up fund-raising from the board, which officials said had donated $7.9 million last season, up from $4 million in the 2009-10 season. But he said he was frustrated that the orchestra still ran deficits. “I hate that we still have a deficit, and we have to fix that,” said Mr. Parr, who will remain on the board. “It’s not life-threatening, but it’s not good. And so we have to keep focused on that.” When Mr. Schafer and his wife, Didi, began presenting the orchestra’s parks concerts in 2007, they were following a family tradition: his great-aunt, Minnie Schafer Guggenheimer, organized the summer concerts at  He said that after he was elected chairman this week, he had told the board his goal for the orchestra. “I’d like two 25-year-olds to be talking about the Philharmonic,” he said, “and one saying to the other, ‘Have you seen the new hall?’ And the other one says, ‘No, I can’t get tickets!’ ”
