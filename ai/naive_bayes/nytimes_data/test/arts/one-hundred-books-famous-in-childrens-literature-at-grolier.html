Encountering “One Hundred Books Famous in Children’s Literature” at the Grolier Club is like coming upon a convocation of well-preserved old friends, some of them very elderly indeed (and some of whom, it turns out, you have never met before). Your memories begin to spin every which way. Here are early editions of some of the greatest hits of children’s literature from the last 400 years: “Aesop’s Fables,” “Little House on the Prairie,” “Gulliver’s Travels,” “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” “Anne of Green Gables,” “Struwwelpeter” — and, well, 94 others. Your first impulse might be to argue. Why select these books here and not those other ones in your head? Where is “A Wrinkle in Time” and “The Phantom Tollbooth”? Was it really necessary to include the “Dick and Jane Basic Pre-Primer” (1936), featuring the dreary adventures of two tiresome children and their equally tiresome dog, Spot, who all but ruined first grade for generations of Americans? What is “The Governess” (1749) and why is it so important? But this is a fruitless line of thought. The exhibition works entirely on its own terms, the selection criteria so specific that the choices feel virtually unimpeachable. Chosen over five years by a group of scholars and other experts, the books are defined as “famous” because they were both initially popular and also admired over time, demonstrating enduring literary merit. Nor does “famous” mean “influential,” “best” or “most famous,” the curator’s introductory notes explain — this is no Top 100 list. Because the books are only for children 12 and younger, and because the publication cutoff date is 2000, the works end with “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone,” as the first book in the series was called in Britain. This is a lovely place to spend an afternoon. The Grolier is a club for bibliophiles. It has a quiet and scholarly air, but also a sense of buzzy excitement. Its members are people who are thrilled by books, and that is in itself thrilling. As I wandered through the exhibition, I kept overhearing snatches of intriguing conversation. “It’s nice to see the 1865 Alice, of course,” said one visitor to another as they peered at “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” A man wearing a jaunty feathered hat and a peacoat made of what appeared to be mink looked like a not-so-dark version of Edward Gorey. Speaking of which, if it wasn’t for my policy of not quibbling with the selection, I would think it was a shame that Mr. Gorey’s work was not included here. But never mind that! The material is elegantly divided by theme — fantasy; fairy tales and fables; faith and learning; nursery rhymes and poetry; girls and boys; animals; adventure and novelties; and toys — each in its own case, with fantasy getting two cases, since there are numerous examples. Many of the books are exquisite. Some are very old. Some are very tiny. Some are all three, like Charles Perrault’s “Histoires, ou Contes du Temps Passé,” published in Paris in 1667. Why is it here? Because it was in this very book that classic stories like “Little Red Riding Hood,” “Puss in Boots” and “Cinderella” first appeared in print. There are many things to learn if you attend to the smart, lovingly written caption cards for the books and the book-related artifacts — cards, toys, games — that are also on display. Here are some of the things I learned. Andrew Lang’s wife wrote some of the famous color-schemed fairy books attributed to him. The self-improving “History of Little Goody Two Shoes” (1766) was published in more than 200 editions, including a 1940 abridged version meant for reading in air-raid shelters. A grim-sounding 1700 book called “A Token for Children” was widely popular, despite supposedly being an account of the pious deathbed confessions and “joyful deaths” of “several young children.” Also: “The Magic Pudding” (1918), as loopy a work of nonsense as you could hope for, one of the world’s great, possibly unwitting examples of stoner literature, was a flop until its author, Norman Lindsay, cleverly reissued it with tinted illustrations. The political cartoonist Thomas Nast did the drawings for the first edition of Clement C. Moore’s “A Visit From St. Nicholas,” giving Santa the jolly form he still has today. Also: At one point you could buy a “Pollyanna” board game (1916), modeled on Parcheesi, in which players convened, nauseatingly, at something called the “glad entrance.” As of 2000, “The Poky Little Puppy” (1942) was the best-selling children’s hardback published in the United States, with more than 14 million copies sold. In 1991, Barbara Bush gave Raisa Gorbachev, wife of the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a sculpture of Mrs. Mallard and her ducklings from “Make Way for Ducklings” (1941). Marjorie Williams Bianco, author of “The Velveteen Rabbit” (1922), had a pet rabbit named Fluffy. The exhibition is relaxing to take in, not too dense or overwhelming, not too crowded, and you can pay as much or as little attention as you want. The best strategy is to dip in and out, as you might with a picture book, before focusing on something that grabs your fancy. After all that splendor, my favorite thing may well have been the reading table in the middle of the room, piled with copies of some of the books from the show that are still in print. Sitting down to those books after seeing them behind glass was like opening a box of madeleines — one of them, in fact, was “Madeline” (1939) — because what you really want from a book is not to look at but to read. I picked up “The Cat in the Hat” (1957) and remembered how exciting it was to fall all those years ago into its subversive, parent-free realm, in which two kids are left inexplicably alone with the world’s most useless babysitter, a pet fish. And how nice it was to find the title character of “The Story of Ferdinand” (1936) still reposing under his cork tree, smelling the flowers, and to come upon “Pat the Bunny” (1940) and be reminded once more that pat in this case is not someone’s name but an imperative verb, and that this was the first touch-and-feel book I ever had. And of course there was “Charlotte’s Web” (1952), which has one of the best
