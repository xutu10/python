New York City Opera’s Name and Other Assets Attract Suitors
Bids, and a possible auction, for the opera’s remaining assets are set for next month.

Inheritance battles propel plenty of operas, including Puccini’s lighthearted  Whether that will translate into the revival of City Opera that many New York opera lovers are hoping for remains to be seen. City Opera’s board  Another suitor, Gene Kaufman, an architect, argued in court papers that City Opera’s board had mishandled its affairs, allowing its endowment to be severely depleted and that the company’s assets should be sold in a court-supervised auction. But Mr. Kaufman’s plans have also raised eyebrows. City Opera officials said in court papers that in his proposals, he had exaggerated his relationships with two prominent groups: Opera America, a service organization, and the Glimmerglass Festival, which presents operas in upstate New York. The two sides could face off next month: Judge Sean H. Lane of United States Bankruptcy Court ruled on Dec. 22 that bids for City Opera’s name and assets would be due on Jan. 12, and he set a hearing on the sale — which could become an auction if there are multiple bids — for Jan. 20. What should happen next to City Opera, which presented its last production, “Anna Nicole,” in September 2013 and filed for bankruptcy the next month, is a vexing question that has divided local opera lovers, opera singers, musicians and even unions that are usually allied. Some are embracing the  The musicians’ union, which has sued Mr. Capasso’s old company to collect the money that its members are owed, has expressed support for the plan, as have some opera singers who want to see the company brought back to life. The family of Julius Rudel, the maestro who presided over City Opera’s golden age and who died in June at 93, has embraced the proposal. The family is planning a memorial tribute to Mr. Rudel for March 9, expected to feature Plácido Domingo and Sting, at the Rose Theater that will benefit the NYCO Renaissance group. But others question the plan’s feasibility and whether the ideal savior of a bankrupt opera company is an impresario whose old company went bust. The musicians’ union, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, filed a grievance in 2010 against Dicapo Opera and  Several singers, who were not protected by a union, said in interviews that they were not paid for their last week of work in Dicapo’s 2012 production of Frank Loesser’s  Many of those singers, including the baritone Stan Lacy, are still waiting for those checks. “It’s like kicking somebody when they’re down,” Mr. Lacy said. “You’ve been promised not a whole lot of money, made sacrifices to do something, and then the checks don’t come through.” Asked about his email claiming the delay had been caused by a banking issue, Mr. Capasso said in an interview: “I apologize for that. That was exactly what the truth was at that moment. Exactly.” He said he still planned to pay the performers what they are owed. Alan S. Gordon, the executive director of the American Guild of Musical Artists, which represents opera choristers and soloists, among others, called the NYCO Renaissance plan “an imaginative but grossly underfunded pipe dream, an unrealizable fantasy that will frustrate the hopes of opera lovers for a revival of City Opera” and noted that Mr. Capasso had not been able to succeed with a much smaller company, let alone a major one. Mr. Gordon said that the proposal had recommended paying singers less than musicians and that the guild threatened to picket its performances. Mr. Niederhoffer said in several interviews that while Mr. Capasso had been chosen for his knowledge in artistic matters, the responsibility for managing finances would reside with the board and that he was confident that the new company could be put on a firm budgetary footing. He said he expected the group to reach a deal with the guild of musical artists to work with unionized choristers. “In every way, we are restoring City Opera to its proper place,” Mr. Niederhoffer said. The other main suitor for the City Opera’s assets, Mr. Kaufman, is also facing questions about his proposals. Andrea Nellis, who has been acting as chief executive officer of City Opera since it entered bankruptcy, said in court papers that Mr. Kaufman’s initial proposal for reviving City Opera had overstated his relationship with Opera America, a service group that provided him with data that he used in developing his proposal. Marc A. Scorca, Opera America’s president, wrote in a Jan. 17 letter that Mr. Kaufman’s proposal had represented his group “in a manner that is not consistent with our understanding of our relationship.” Ms. Nellis said in her filing that Mr. Kaufman had submitted an updated proposal in August suggesting a merger with the Glimmerglass Festival — which was followed by a letter from the festival that said “the Board has not participated in the preparation of the Kaufman proposal, has not authorized it and takes no responsibility for it.” Mr. Kaufman said in an email that both proposals were solely his, as he believed was clear in his submissions, and that neither Glimmerglass nor Opera America — as the groups’ letters make clear — was meant to be a co-applicant. Other suitors who have submitted proposals for City Opera’s assets include the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Purchase College. It’s unclear just how far the City Opera name and its thrift shop on East 23rd Street can carry a new company that will have to raise the money and the audience to produce opera in New York. The most valuable asset City Opera has — its endowment, worth an estimated $4.5 million — is not part of the federal bankruptcy proceeding. The state attorney general’s office argued before a judge that it should be distributed later to nonprofit groups that “the court determines will most effectively accomplish the gift’s purpose and the donor’s intent.”
