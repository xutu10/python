Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen: As much as you may think you know the songs of these two musical patriarchs, the British singer  Ms. Jungr (pronounced younger) spit out Mr. Dylan’s “Masters of War” with a furious contempt and disgust, then crouched over an imaginary coffin and shouted, “And I’ll stand over your grave ’til I’m sure that you’re dead.” Mr. Dylan’s unsparing condemnation of the war machine took on the power of an eternal curse. Only the raw twang of Mr. Dylan’s original version surpassed Ms. Jungr’s in lofty fury. The show emphasized the similarities of these songwriters who flung their streams of consciousness onto the page in sometimes messy, incomprehensible torrents of emotion. While Mr. Dylan often ranted, Mr. Cohen rarely raised his voice beyond a sagelike sepulchral drone, but the effect was similar. Both are social prophets whose words carry heavy emotional weight. Ms. Jungr, who was accompanied on piano by Tracy Stark and on percussion by Mike Lunoe, has a voice that can be tender as well as caustic. Her ability to run the emotional gamut lends the show an astounding emotional range. Not a word or an implication was missed in interpretations that conveyed the knowledge of a crusading forensic scientist passionately uncovering the truth. Ms. Jungr, 60, used her whole body and expressive face to illustrate lyrics with a carefully determined intensity that made it appear as if she were living inside the songs from moment to moment. Although her tone of warning outweighed occasional flashes of joy and humor, Ms. Jungr, her expression radiant, transformed Mr. Dylan’s “Chimes of Freedom” into a blinding illumination of hope and compassion. As for imagining the future, Mr. Cohen’s sarcastic “Everybody Knows” took the honors as the evening’s most prophetic number. Here are some of the things that “everybody knows”: “The dice are loaded,” “the fight was fixed,” “the plague is coming,” “the scene is dead,” “you’re in trouble,” and “it’s coming apart,” all capped with a shrug of despair and cynicism (“that’s how it goes”). For the audience members who stood and cheered, it was a moment of catharsis.
