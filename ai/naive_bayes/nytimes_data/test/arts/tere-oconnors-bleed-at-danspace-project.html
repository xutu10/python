Tere O’Connor’s ‘Bleed’ at Danspace Project
In Tere O’Connor’s “Bleed,” erratic movement bristles with coexisting meanings.
===
Over the past 12 months,  The culmination of a four-part suite, “Bleed” contains the choreographic DNA of three dances created before it, in 2012: “Poem,” “Secret Mary” and “Sister.” It funnels structures and afterimages from those worlds into a fourth, even fuller world, folding several societies into one. Every member of the 11-person cast (the combined casts of the earlier three works) is equally an agent of what happens here, equally accountable to and for the others. Eleven: an odd number, a prime number and, for a space the size of the St. Mark’s Church sanctuary, a big number. Does that somehow explain the intoxicating tension between order and disorder, utopia and tragedy, the multitude of relationships that rush to the surface of “Bleed” and dive back under? The stage is bare, but Michael O’Connor’s stealthy lighting and James Baker’s capacious score — a collage of monastic incantations, industrial chugging and other sonic gems — conjure an ever-changing sense of place. I saw courtyards, graveyards, forests, marshes, coliseums, city streets. Just as potently, unstably suggestive is the movement itself: ornate, erratic stuff that bristles with competing (or just coexisting) meanings. The same actions, deployed under different circumstances, tell entirely different stories, or invite us to piece one together. In a shifty, hip-swaying solo that opens the show, Heather Olson (in one of Walter Dundervill’s attractive dresses) comically gasps and falls to the floor, the first of many near-deaths and resuscitations. Later she does the same thing, but this time toward Oisin Monaghan, who lies on his back in a rectangle of light reminiscent of a coffin. From moments of collective entropy, intimate encounters crystallize — fleeting solos, trios, duets — as others stand by and watch. It often takes more than one pair of hands to manipulate or lift a single body: one dancer supporting another supporting another. “Bleed” returns repeatedly to the image of the whole group scattered along a diagonal, standing still, arranged at different angles but always conveying a sense of readiness, of shared responsibility. An expert in compressing and expanding time, Mr. O’Connor allows us to lose track of it. “Bleed” suspends the watcher in its own webs of watching and being watched. When Mr. Monaghan, at the end, again lies down in that patch of light as his companions chant and stomp on the perimeter, we could be witnessing something that began long ago and could keep going forever.
