PBS’s ‘How We Got to Now,’ With Steven Johnson
Progress is the evolution of the everyday, taught by the author Steven Johnson, on “How We Got to Now,” on PBS.

Everyone who loves history encountered, somewhere along the line, a teacher who connected the dots, who imparted the revelation that history isn’t memorizing dates and names but seeing how one thing influenced another until we arrived at today. The author Steven Johnson fills that role engagingly in  Mr. Johnson, whose books include  The opening episode, for instance, is called “Clean,” and it sets the pattern for the five that follow. We tend not to acknowledge just how recent some of the trends and comforts of modern life are, including the luxury of not walking through horse manure and human waste on the way to the post office. The episode turns back the clock just a century and a half, to a time before our liquid waste stream was largely contained in underground pipes. Mr. Johnson then traces the emergence of the idea that with a little effort, cities and towns could have a cleaner existence, and the concurrent idea that cleanliness would have public health benefits. But his examination of “the ultraclean revolution,” as he calls it, doesn’t stop at the construction of sewage and water-purification systems. He extends the thread all the way to the computer revolution, visiting a laboratory where microchips are made. Why is “clean” important here? “A speck of household dust landing on one of these delicate silicon wafers would be comparable to Mount Everest landing in the streets of Manhattan,” he explains. Similarly, “Time,” the second episode (also being broadcast on Wednesday), examines humanity’s relatively recent efforts to measure and standardize time, and then brings the subject into the cellphone age, noting how precise calibration of time is used in, for example, GPS technology. And “Cold,” scheduled for Nov. 5, looks at how efforts to mitigate the heat — first by shipping ice south, then through artificial air-conditioning — influenced not only our diets (think of frozen foods) but also our settlement patterns and even our presidential elections (since air-conditioning changed the demographics of the American South and Southwest). Even Hollywood felt the effects: The ability to air-condition theaters in the 1920s brought in summer crowds and helped establish movies as a cultural anchor. Other episodes take up “Sound,” “Light” and “Glass.” Through them all, Mr. Johnson champions the contributions of ordinary men and women who had big ideas and acted on them. Some profited and became famous, but others are relatively unknown; it was left to others to build on and capitalize on their breakthroughs. That dovetails with another of Mr. Johnson’s premises: that advances result from cumulative effort and insight. “It’s what I call the slow hunch,” he explains in the “Cold” episode. “If you want to understand how big ideas truly save the world, you need to get rid of the myth of the eureka moment. The truth is, there’s no such thing as a light bulb going off in the mind of a lone genius. Our best ideas start as something else, a vague sense of possibility, a hint of something bigger.” Mr. Johnson could easily have planted himself in a chair and delivered this material, but that wouldn’t be very good television. Instead, his is a rolling lecture: He delivers pieces of it from the San Francisco sewer system, an indoor ski resort in Dubai and an endless number of other locales. It’s an exceedingly watchable history lesson, and all in support of his central thesis, which he articulates in “Cold” thus: “We make our ideas, and they make us in return.”
