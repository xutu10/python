Marco Rios: ‘"S” Is for Sincere, Formerly Formally “F” Is for Fake’
Here is an exhibition of Marco Rios’s own childhood artwork, done between the ages of 3 and 5.

Artists have been using the work of children as source material for decades: Paul Klee and the Art Brut and Cobra movements are a few examples. Marco Rios adds a twist, using his own childhood drawings, made between the ages of 3 and 5, as fodder for a new series of paintings. In a gallery news release, Mr. Rios says that upon encountering the cache of drawings his mother had saved, he thought they looked like paintings he wished he could make but couldn’t now, “with my academic background.” The idea of art school’s ruining the artist is one thread. Attempting forgery on your juvenile self is another: The “F Is for Fake” part of the exhibition title is borrowed from a  Ultimately, Mr. Rios calls these paintings collaborations rather than forgeries. Bold, scrawling and colorful, they’re immediately identifiable as children’s drawings. But Mr. Rios has enlarged them with an overhead projector, framing and cropping them in a composed way that only an adult would. The works are eye-catching, like those of Klee or Karel Appel (of Cobra), who alchemized children’s imagery into visionary art. (Mr. Rios is not, it should be noted, primarily a painter.) The question rippling underneath this project perhaps is whether an artist’s childhood drawings are better — more skilled, competent or knowing — than drawings by the rest of us, who didn’t become artists. Was Mr. Rios a gifted artist as a child? Sure. Then again, we all were.
