Contact! Series Opens With John Adams’s Choices
John Adams selected five works by four composers for the season’s opening concert of the Contact! series, presented on Monday at SubCulture.

For the composer John Adams, hosting the New York Philharmonic’s Contact! program at SubCulture in the East Village on Monday night must have felt like getting back to basics in contemporary music. Two days earlier, the Metropolitan Opera had presented the final performance of Mr. Adams’s opera  On Monday, though, Mr. Adams had the happy task of presenting five works by four composers he had selected for the opening concert in this season’s Contact! series. This was the first of three Contact! programs presented by the Philharmonic and the 92nd Street Y at SubCulture, the appealingly intimate basement performance space. (The two others in the series will be at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.) Speaking to the audience on Monday, Mr. Adams said he was “horrified” to see a photograph of himself in the program book. This evening “is not at all about me,” he emphasized. Yet, in a way it was, since he had put together this program of stylistically diverse and fascinating works. Three of the composers — the Americans  The program opened with Mr. Bjarnason’s “Bow to String,” a 2009 work originally written for solo cello with multilayered electronic elements. The version played here, by members of the Philharmonic with a few guest artists, is for solo cello and nine instrumentalists. The first movement is pulsing, thick and frenetic, with aggressive, Bartok-like chords, given extra punch by a thumping piano. The second movement is like a fractured, jittery dance, at once cosmic and sensual. In the slow, subdued final movement, the elegiac solo cello is comforted by hazy, plush, pungent chords. “Mahler would be envious,” Mr. Adams said. Nathan Vickery was the formidable cello soloist; the impressive ensemble was conducted by the dynamic Jayce Ogren. Mr. Marshall’s “Muddy Waters” (2004) uses a tune from the Bay Psalm Book of 1692, which is put through extraordinary transfigurations during this atmospheric, involving work, scored imaginatively for cello, bass, electric guitar, bass clarinet, marimba and piano. Ms. Mazzoli wrote “Dissolve, O My Heart” as a solo work for the violinist Jennifer Koh, part of Ms. Koh’s Bach & Beyond project, in which she asks composers to write pieces that spin off in some way from Bach. This one begins with the “iconic opening chord,” as Ms. Mazzoli said, of Bach’s stunning Chaconne in D minor for solo violin, then ventures impetuously into excursions of runs, riffs and teeming outbursts. Ms. Mazzoli explained that her intriguing concept here was to suggest a piece that “keeps trying to become a chaconne” but “keeps failing.” It was played brilliantly by Anna Rabinova. There was another work by Mr. Bjarnason, “Five Possibilities” for clarinet (Pascual Martínez Forteza), cello (Patrick Jee) and piano (Eric Huebner), a quirky suite of short, epigrammatic movements in various moods. The program ended with an intensely dramatic account of Mr. Andres’s compact, densely packed “Early to Rise,” a string quartet of four sections integrated into one episodic movement. Mr. Andres uses a five-note motif from a Schumann piano piece as a “seed,” as he said, “hardly anything,” yet “just enough” to suggest all manner of things that can be done with it. Afterward, as is the tradition at SubCulture, the artists and the audience mingled over drinks and snacks by the space’s inviting bar.
