Michal Samama Performs at the Chocolate Factory
In “Background Materials,” Michal Samama experiments in movement and sounds with ideas of what is distant and what is not.

It’s not an uncommon New York experience: You leave the city for the country, where sounds play a surreal game of trading places. Horns are replaced by cicadas and chatter by the wind, until you start to hear anew. When does background noise become something more? In her evening-length performance piece “Background Materials,”  Ms. Samama’s excavation of the Chocolate Factory, as seen on Wednesday, begins and ends in the lobby, where she greets viewers with an invitation to enter the upstairs theater, where we are welcome to “eat and drink during the show.” Before we make our way to the spread, however, she becomes still; then peeling back an eyelid, she opens her mouth wide using her fingers like fishhooks. Tilting her chin up, she pulls her nostrils back — the very image of a pig’s snout. This intimate display is somehow more like watching a close-up video than an actual person, which is odd given that her face is mere inches away. But this is one of Ms. Samama’s gifts: Just as she can make faraway images seem closer than they are, she can morph into an object herself. In the theater, Ms. Samama, with a whistle in her mouth, removes her clothing and lies on the floor next to the room’s white brick wall. Stretching her legs up the wall and folding them into her belly, she travels in a continuous spiral along its perimeter. It’s painstaking work, and her labored breathing is audible through the whistle. But there are other background noises as well: Faintly, from an elevator shaft, come drums and cymbals. As she presses on, her lack of costume becomes less about nudity than skin, and the minuscule contrasts within Ms. Samama’s body are discernible: Muscular power gives way to lingering extensions, tension to release. When we progress to the darkened basement, Ms. Samama, spinning in place, holds a clear plastic bag that fills with air. She ties a knot and straddles the inflated bag, rubbing its surface to create a wince-inducing squeak. But when the bag finally pops, there isn’t much of a bang. Shock value has no part in Ms. Samama’s world. Instead, her performance experiments zero in on the in-between, where everyday materials become temporal objects, the foreground retreats and the background comes into glittering focus.
