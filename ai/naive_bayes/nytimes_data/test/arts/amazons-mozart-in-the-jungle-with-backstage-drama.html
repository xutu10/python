For Amazon, “Transparent” was a little like the 1968 New York Jets of the upstart American Football League, the surprise winners of Super Bowl III. After Netflix scored the first two big victories in the original-digital game with “House of Cards” and “Orange Is the New Black,” Amazon (in this metaphor, the A.F.L.) turned the tables with “Transparent,” one of the best- Which makes  “Transparent” and “Mozart in the Jungle” both stand out, in the first place, for what they’re not; neither is about crime, politics or the supernatural.

Quick on its feet and rarely dull (though Ms. Burrows’s story line could use a little more oomph), “Mozart in the Jungle” signals that someone at Amazon has good and interesting taste.
