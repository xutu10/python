Steve Tyrell Sings Standards at Caf&eacute; Carlyle
Steve Tyrell celebrated a milestone when he opened his 10th holiday season show at Café Carlyle on Tuesday.

Steve Tyrell’s opening-night show at Café Carlyle on Tuesday was a milestone, both for the club and for Mr. Tyrell, who 10 years ago took over the cafe’s holiday slot previously occupied by Bobby Short. It didn’t seem so at the time, but Mr. Tyrell’s ascendance signaled a changing of the guard at the chic Upper East Side club, where the elegant Mr. Short had entertained bohemian socialites for more than three decades. Like it or not, Mr.  His newest show, “That Lovin’ Feelin’,” is the title of a forthcoming album of the songs that emerged from the New York songwriting factories in the 1960s. He told his story of arriving in New York after the epiphanic moment he first heard Ben E. King’s 1961 hit “Stand by Me.” To hear him tell it, it was the rock ’n’ roll equivalent of running away from home and joining the circus. Once in New York City, he worked as an arranger and producer for Florence Greenberg, the founder of Scepter Records (the Shirelles, Dionne Warwick). Mr. Tyrell declared that Ms. Greenberg, who died in 1995, deserved induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, an honor that has eluded her. The program was a mixture of songs from Mr. Tyrell’s last album, “It’s Magic,” a tribute to the lyricist and Frank Sinatra crony Sammy Cahn, and the new album. Mr. Tyrell’s calling card is the sound of his friendly growl. He pays little attention to the subtleties of lyrics or to rhythmic nuance. He did what he needed to do. Songs like “Stand by Me,” “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’ ” and “Will You Love Me Tomorrow?,” powered by his vocal swagger, pushed those nostalgic buttons.
