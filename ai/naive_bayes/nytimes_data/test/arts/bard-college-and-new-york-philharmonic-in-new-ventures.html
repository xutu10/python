Bard College and New York Philharmonic in New Ventures
Bard College will start a training ensemble, while the New York Philharmonic will begin an academy with partners around the world.

A music school is entering the orchestra business, forming a new training ensemble in New York whose players will get master’s degrees. The New York Philharmonic, meanwhile, is expanding its teaching role, starting an academy to train students all over the world. There was a whiff of “Freaky Friday,” or perhaps “Trading Places,” about this pair of unrelated, yet oddly symmetrical developments that were announced on Wednesday, with a school behaving like an orchestra, and an orchestra behaving like a school. But both initiatives underscored the extent to which the difficulties facing classical music in the 21st century are forcing venerable institutions to adapt, if not reinvent themselves. The new training orchestra, which is being formed next year by the “If it’s successful, then we will have a new training model for the professional musician,” Mr. Botstein said, as he disclosed his plans for the orchestra in an interview. Mr. Botstein added that he hoped the program would not only prepare students for a working musician’s life, but also give them chances to experiment with different approaches for connecting modern audiences with serious music. “You’ll have a route, one very powerful route, to revitalizing the orchestra experience for both the player and for the audience,” he said. As he announced plans for the new orchestra, which does not yet have a name, the New York Philharmonic announced the next phase of its plans to expand its educational activities. The orchestra said that it would start the New York Philharmonic Global Academy, an umbrella group to build on the partnerships that it began this year with the Shanghai Orchestra Academy and the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, Calif., with plans to add more partners to the program by the end of the year. “We want to send a signal to New York, but also outside of New York, that we have a lot of talent and a lot of expertise to offer, and sometimes that happens on the main stage in performance, but it can also happen in an educational context,” Matthew VanBesien, the Philharmonic’s president and executive director, said in an interview. Philharmonic musicians will continue to travel to Shanghai and Santa Barbara to play and teach, and students from both places will be brought to New York to train and play at Avery Fisher Hall. The first 10 visiting students, from the Music Academy of the West, will arrive in New York in January. Students from the Shanghai Orchestra Academy are due next season. The orchestra’s expanded international educational offerings, which will be paid for both through fees and contributions from donors, will complement its traditional touring activity, Mr. VanBesien said. But where master classes were once thought of as extras that musicians could squeeze in during free time while on tours, they will now play a more central role. The Philharmonic also sees the long-term relationships — the Santa Barbara and Shanghai partnerships are each to last four years — as chances to meet donors far from Lincoln Center. And the orchestra said that it was establishing a 12-person international advisory board with members in Europe, Asia and South America to help it support the orchestra’s activities abroad, including tours, educational ventures and other projects. The creation of the Longy-Bard orchestra and the Philharmonic’s Global Academy both point to a curious fact of life in the classical music world: Talented young players continue to want to hone their art even as orchestras struggle financially. So schools are looking for ways to prepare their students for the changed landscape, and orchestras are looking for ways to tap into the enthusiasm — and funding — for educational programs as they try to survive. Mr. Botstein of Bard, who is also the music director of the American Symphony Orcestra, said that he hoped that the new training orchestra, which he said was inspired in part by Michael Tilson Thomas’s  One idea he is considering: performing a complete cycle of Haydn symphonies over several years, with each concert including works from multiple periods. He said that he wants the orchestra to work with conductors such as James Conlon, JoAnn Falletta and Adam Fischer. The training orchestra, Mr. Botstein said, is “a completely, I think, fresh approach to equipping the musician of the future with a set of skills, and knowledge, and perspective of how to really generate a vital performing life.”
