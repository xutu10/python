‘NCIS: New Orleans’ Begins on Tuesday on CBS
The “NCIS” franchise tries a Southern locale, New Orleans, where a severed leg might turn up in a crate of freshly netted shrimp.

Eggs Creole sounds pretty good. Adding andouille sausage is probably a tad more than a healthy breakfast needs, but, whatever, this is New Orleans. It’s the rémoulade sauce on the side that suggests that “ The chef doling out the food is Dwayne Pride (Scott Bakula), a Louisiana native who runs the New Orleans branch of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and is in the office, cooking up a home-style breakfast for himself and his team. There are other adjustments to the colorful new location: A severed leg turns up in a crate of freshly netted shrimp. But even though this spinoff follows the formula of the “NCIS” and “NCIS: Los Angeles” as closely as it can, it’s noticeably fainter: a copy of a copy. That doesn’t mean that it won’t be successful, however. This crime drama, which runs immediately after “NCIS,” could be more valuable as a test of television rules than as a drama; even when copies of formulaic shows fall short, the formula alone can sustain them. Mr. Bakula adds a hint of a drawl but doesn’t try to imitate a Louisiana accent, which is probably just as well. It’s almost impossible to do right, and so embarrassingly bad when wrong. Instead, he makes up for it by wearing floral shirts and loving jazz and gumbo. The best thing about the show could be the theme music, Big Head Todd and the Monsters performing “Boom Boom.” The show is shot in New Orleans, but that doesn’t make it a procedural “Treme,” the HBO drama set in the same city, post-Hurricane Katrina. This is more like Encino on the bayou. “ Some of the more interesting characters have moved on, notably Ziva (Cote de Pablo), the Mossad agent on loan to the Navy for so long that she eventually took American citizenship. But even she was seamlessly replaced. Like well-worn shirts, the main characters have been put through so many cycles of hot and cold danger and personal crisis that they have lost much of their original vibrancy and starch, yet still wear well. “ The Louisiana version has almost all the same elements and an even more unprofessional office setting in the French Quarter, with lots of exposed brick, leather armchairs and weathered tables. Where a computer should go, a kitchen range stands. Despite all those touches, the pacing is slower, the jokes more labored, the personalities more wooden. Pride is a little melancholy, possibly because he is sleeping in an office back room, even though he has a wife at home. Pride cheers up around Christopher LaSalle (Lucas Black), a laid-back Southern investigator, and Meredith Brody (Zoe McLellan), a transplant from the Midwest who is having a little trouble adapting to life in the Big Easy. CCH Pounder is Dr. Loretta Wade, the warm, slightly eccentric medical examiner who has an overeager, brainy assistant. Wade smiles indulgently as the team tries to guess how the amputation in the case of the week was done. The cut is too precise to be from a boat injury or a shark bite. “Rabid squid? Mutant starfish from hell?” Pride says, adding unnecessarily, “Just trying to keep it light.” These kinds of shows, and CBS has many more constructed around gruesome morgue scenes and cutesy characters, are popular for a reason, and it’s not a bad one. Predictable mystery sounds like an oxymoron, but it’s the sustaining principle of whodunits as different as “Miss Marple” on PBS and “Law & Order: SVU” on NBC. Reassuringly likable characters and predictably loathsome villains balance hideous deaths, grotesque corpses and murderous conspiracies. It’s an entertainment speedball that can grow addictive but is certainly not hazardous to the viewer’s health. “NCIS: New Orleans” may not be great, but it isn’t going to kill anyone.
