36 Hours in Santa Fe
Winter offers a slower, less-crowded Santa Fe experience, leaving time for visitors to savor culture, a cocktail or a green-chile cheeseburger.
===
In summer, Santa Fe bursts at the seams with arts fairs, opera and other flashy events. In winter, though, the schedule is less hectic, and the few tourists spend their days skiing outside town. This is when residents effectively reclaim the center, the walkable area from the old plaza to the newer Railyard district. The only glitz and glitter is the snow sparkling under a sunny blue sky and paper-bag lanterns glowing in the black night. In recent years, many of the city’s most loved institutions have expanded, been renovated or have even returned from the dead — and there’s no better time to enjoy them than the colder months, alongside Santa Feans who have been appreciating them for decades. 1. History in a Mug | 3 p.m. Cold weather calls for hot chocolate, and Kakawa Chocolate House puts a special spin on it — this is no Swiss Miss. The “elixirs” ($3.75), as the owner calls the chocolate drinks served in dainty blue-and-white Mexican mugs, are based on recipes from ancient Mesoamerica and medieval Europe, with combinations that include a barely sweet chocolate-and-corn atole and the Marie Antoinette elixir, fragrant with cinnamon and orange-flower water. If you’re not bouncing off the walls of the tiny adobe shop after one mug, also try an invigorating chile-spiked caramel. 2. Art Roundup | 4 p.m. Santa Fe’s economy is substantially based on creative endeavors — which, some locals quip, include the state government. Fitting, then, that the Roundhouse, as the New Mexico State Capitol is called, holds a collection of over 600 paintings, drawings and sculptures, all by New Mexican artists and all free to visit. When the Legislature convenes, late January through March (in even-numbered years, through February), you can take a break from art appreciation, or expand your definition of it, by sitting in on the proceedings. 3. Desert Thirst | 6 p.m. Discerning drinkers agree: Secreto Lounge is the city’s best cocktail bar, thanks to Chris Milligan’s “garden to glass” approach. This means fresh herbs and other surprises, such as the Scarlet Punch ($11), with bourbon and house-spiced cranberry juice, or the spicy Agave Way, a sort-of margarita with grapes and green chile. (Skeptics can opt for a meticulous vintage cocktail, or a New Mexican wine.) Aficionados will also want to toddle a few blocks south to the tasting room of Santa Fe Spirits, established in 2010. Two to try: the gin, infused with sage and osha root, and the unaged malt whiskey, surprisingly complex and tequila-like. 4. For 15 years, the chef Joseph Wrede worked culinary magic in Taos; when his restaurant there closed in 2010, a Santa Fe restaurateur lured him south. But Mr. Wrede wasn’t settled until he was running his own place, Joseph’s — which, when it opened in October 2013, quickly filled with loyal patrons. Perhaps that’s because the menu is Santa Fe’s self-image in a nutshell: proud of local ingredients, open to international flavors and just as comfortable with a delicate cardamom-honey root-vegetable napoleon ($24) as with a killer lamb burger ($15). Pace yourself, the better to savor the caramel duck-fat ice cream. 5. George R. R. Martin is best known to the wider world as the author of “Game of Thrones,” but locally, the 35-year Santa Fe resident is also the guy who saved Jean Cocteau Cinema. The jewel-box single-screen was a fixture until it closed in 2006. Mr. Martin revived it last year, adding a digital projector and expanding the programming to include not just art flicks but also readings by sci-fi and fantasy authors and occasional one-off screenings of, say, Vincent Price classics or “Pulp Fiction.” (Not to worry, Thronies: Mr. Martin has delegated daily operations and gone back to work writing.) 6. Dating back to 1905, and smack in the center of town, the Plaza Cafe is not the tourist trap one might expect. Instead, it’s an unpretentious Greek diner (the Razatos family has run it since 1947) where you can get a feta omelet as well as a breakfast burrito ($10.75) or lacy blue-corn-and-pine-nut pancakes ($10.50). A kitchen fire closed it for two years, leaving a hole in the city fabric. Since its 2012 reopening, the place is a bit shinier, but most of the regulars are back, nursing their bowls of posole, reading The Santa Fe New Mexican and arguing about city politics. 7.  Santa Fe has a big backyard, and one patch of it, Valles Caldera National Preserve, is especially beautiful when the snow falls. In the Jemez Mountains northwest of the city, the 89,000-acre former ranch is home to elk, coyotes and bald eagles. You can tour the caldera, a vast basin formed by a collapsed volcano, on snowshoes (for rent at preserve headquarters for $15) or cross-country skis. But even when there’s no white stuff, the stark solitude is beautiful. Join a 45-minute van tour ($5) to the old ranch house, then take a solo hike across the treeless expanse of Valle Grande, the large central meadow. 8.  Whispering snow melts/Falling on steaming bodies/Am I in Japan? No, you’re still in Santa Fe — but Ten Thousand Waves, a series of outdoor pools set amid pine trees on a hill outside town, does perfectly impersonate a rural ryokan. Since its founding in the early 1980s, the bathhouse has evolved from a hippie hot tub spot to a full-service spa resort. Block out several hours to enjoy the facilities (from $23.50 in the public tubs, $33 per hour in private ones) plus an herbal wrap or an excellent massage (from $112) from one of the 125 therapists on staff. 9.  Guests at Izanami, the restaurant at Ten Thousand Waves, which opened a year ago, are welcome to shuffle over from the spa in their robes and slippers. The elegant mountain-lodge atmosphere and the menu, developed by the locally beloved chef Kim Müller, earned the place a position as semifinalist for the James Beard Foundation award for best new restaurant. Diners on a post-bath health high can nibble light dishes like burdock-root salad ($7), while heartier eaters can dig in to Japan-meets-America pub grub, such as the supremely beefy burger seasoned with yakitori sauce ($14). The sake list is detailed and enlightening. 10.  Conscientiously sourced coffee isn’t new to Santa Fe — Ohori’s has been roasting it in small batches for 30 years. Swing by its comfortable two-year-old location on Cerrillos Road for a cup of ink-black java, then, with senses duly sharpened, plunge into some bargain-hunting a few blocks away at El Museo Cultural Winter Market. With 60 or so eclectic vendors in the converted warehouse space, you might spy vintage cowboy regalia, first-edition books or found-object art, plus live music and from-scratch soups and baked goods. Get there before 10:30, when the train from Albuquerque deposits a fresh batch of eager shoppers. For crafts, head across the tracks to the Railyard Artisan Market, in the farmers’ market pavilion every Sunday. A cafe in back can replenish you with green drinks and other healthy morning essentials. 11.  To many Santa Feans, the Lannan Foundation, based here since 1997, is synonymous with the reading series it sponsors every year (check the schedule for such authors as Karen Russell and Noam Chomsky). The foundation’s charitable largess extends to myriad writing grants, art projects in Marfa, Texas, and the prestigious Prize for Cultural Freedom — as well as a deceptively modest-looking gallery set in two adjacent houses east of the Railyard. Modern and contemporary acquisitions are shown here before being donated to institutions around the country. A recent show focused on nature and the border, and the next one, in January, will feature the landscape photographer Thomas Joshua Cooper. Until then, viewers can call to make appointments to see other pieces from the collection. 12. Here’s the Beef | 1 p.m. You can’t live in or visit New Mexico without developing an opinion about the best green-chile cheeseburger. A recent entrant in the continuing competition is the walk-up Shake Foundation, opened in January by Brian Knox, formerly of the slow-food bistro Aqua Santa. A Santa Fean by way of Wisconsin, Mr. Knox opts for thin patties (regulars usually order a double, $6.50) and lightly toasted, lavishly buttered buns. Seating, year-round, is at picnic tables outside. If it’s too cold, check out Santa Fe Bite, the reincarnation of the longtime burger champ Bobcat Bite. The new location is bigger and far more central, but the 10-ounce chuck-sirloin GCCB ($12) is unchanged. Another good reason to visit Santa Fe in winter: hotel rates drop dramatically, especially at the top end. La Fonda Opened in August,
