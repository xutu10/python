In Baja, Camping, Cactus and Cocktails
Retracing a honeymoon car trip along the Baja California Peninsula.
===
We were many miles down a boulder-strewn dirt road when I heard the bang. I glanced at my husband, Tim, in the passenger seat of Dolly, our decade-old Chevy Astro van. He seemed uncharacteristically concerned. On a folding chair wedged behind us, our friend Jonah, who was catching a lift to the Mexican mainland, was silent. We were only a few hours south of the California border, but we were already very much in another country: a stretch of the Baja coast that was an eerie moonscape of purple and fuchsia boojums, burned-out shells of long-forgotten sedans and abandoned fishing camps; to the east the late-afternoon sky mimicked the Sea of Cortez. For a few long seconds, the gas pedal ceased to do what gas pedals do, but soon we managed to rumble, rev and stall our way down a turnoff toward an uninhabited bay. We set up camp, drank rum by lantern light and fell asleep. That crisp March night six years ago marked the beginning of two adventures. Tim and I had married the year before, bought a used van and drove from Connecticut, where we had quit our jobs as reporters — the start of a belated honeymoon and yearlong road trip through Mexico and Central America. The second adventure involved that bang, which we would eventually learn was the sound of a run-in between a rock and a fuel pump, an event that would leave us stranded in the desert for days, and in and out of auto repair shops for weeks. But what began as a misadventure would become the travel story Tim and I tell again and again, the one that somehow represents who we hope to be, both as travelers and as a couple. Our route took us from the retro, robin’s-egg blue lifeguard towers of Southern California all the way to La Paz, 1,000 miles south of the border. There, we loaded Dolly onto the overnight ferry, now 897 pesos (about $68, at 13 pesos to the dollar) per person, and one of the best bargains in international travel, to Topolobampo, a port town 270 miles north of Mazatlán in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. There were many adventures to come on our luna de miel, but they began on the back roads of Baja. Last summer, when Tim got an assignment in the Sinaloan capital, Culiacán, I decided to join him and suggested we take the long way there, a weeklong road trip following the same route we’d taken years before. And so it was that we found ourselves drinking bright blue cocktails at a near-empty bar in San Felipe, a deserted beach town on the Sea of Cortez. We had awakened that morning, on the edge of a rocky cliff at Playa Saldamando, an hour south of Tijuana. The fog came in overnight, dampening our tent and making our tiny enclosure above the Pacific feel like a nylon cocoon. It was the last long weekend of summer, but we had Saldamando mostly to ourselves. It’s a peculiar place, a private campground down a steep gravel road where aging R.V.s and  We needed sunshine, a swimmable sea, some boozy beach drinks. So although our itinerary pointed us south, we detoured east at Ensenada, our tiny Toyota climbing hills strewn with garage-size rocks, including one painted with the red and green image of the Virgin of Guadalupe. We passed wild horses, dude ranches and yonkes — acres of old cars, piled like battered toys. The last time we made this drive was in March 2008, when we were stunned to find snow on the road, and families parked at turnoffs building snowmen on their hoods. On this trip, rain clouds followed us through the mountains, but by the time we arrived at San Felipe’s beachfront boardwalk three hours later, the temperature was in the 90s. The town was dry and dusty and the tide was out, exposing the rank bottom of the bay. Dogs barked from rebar rooftops and sand blew over the streets like tumbleweeds in a western movie. On either end of town, there were miles of half-finished developments. It looked like the embodiment of the 19th-century dictator Porfirio Díaz’s quip, “Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the United States.” Yet I have affection for this place and its borderland eccentricities. Six years ago, San Felipe was the beginning of our ill-conceived adventure in off-roading. This time, with the benefit of experience and a vehicle we knew to be inadequate to the task, we didn’t risk it. Instead, we returned to Ensenada and the relative comfort of the paved Transpeninsular highway. From there, the road turns inland and runs through an agricultural region of cabbage fields, citrus orchards and hothouses growing mystery crops beneath white plastic roofs. On landscape alone, the area could be mistaken for the Central Valley of “Alta California.” When Tim and I saw the Pacific later that day, we were driving along a stretch of coast where wind-ravaged shrubs grow in sandy soil cut with shallow ravines. The Transpeninsular is well paved but narrow and often without shoulders. I grasped the wheel like a life preserver, approaching each blind curve knowing that I might meet a gas truck halfway into our lane or an overloaded bicyclist. Making it to Mama Espinoza’s, a cafe and museum devoted to the Baja 1000 off-road race, in the tiny town of El Rosario, felt like a reprieve. Neither of us was hungry for Mama’s signature dish, a lobster burrito (of disputed quality since “Mama” herself passed away some years ago), so, once again, we shared an order of fish tacos. To the south of El Rosario, there were hundreds of miles of brutal, beautiful, bizarre desert. In the Valle de Los Cirios, we drove beneath two-story-tall cardón cactuses. The road unfurled like a ribbon in shades of blue and gray. Among the endemic plants were oddities, like the cirio itself, a tree that looks like the tentacles of a subterranean creature, rising and twisting from the parched earth. Its English name, boojum, is said to be taken from a Lewis Carroll poem, “The Hunting of the Snark.” In the one-cafe, one-hotel settlement called Cataviña, we ate lunch in a restaurant with walls of dried and de-spined cactus trunks and a palm frond roof. Flies circled, but the orange juice was fresh-squeezed and chilled with ice cubes, which felt like a minor miracle. Soon after we ordered, an older man and woman joined us in the empty restaurant. They were greeted with warm hugs from the three generations of women running the cafe, who warned that a storm was coming. The couple, from Ontario, had been visiting this same area, deep in the Vizcano Desert, for 40 years. They first traveled through Mexico in 1966, during their own honeymoon. “For years we always camped at the same spot,” said the woman, Marilyn, of their longtime site beneath a cardón with 30-foot branches. “But it’s getting dangerous.” Despite media accounts of Mexico, which can make the entire country seem like a war zone, Baja’s greatest dangers always seem, to me at least, to be treacherous roads and “acts of God” like flash floods, collapsing cactus branches and rare events like Hurricane Odile, which hit southern Baja as a Category 3 storm (the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Baja since 1967) in September. Still, the semiregular security checkpoints, where very young men with very large guns wear desert camo and crack jokes, can be disconcerting. They also bring moments of levity. On the road to San Felipe we watched as a man and his army of dogs — at least a half-dozen mutts of varying sizes — poured out of a small R.V., like clowns from a clown car. Later, outside San Ignacio, a checkpoint soldier noticed our license plates and launched into a rendition of “New York, New York.” That night, our second-to-last night on the road, we slept in a safari-themed yurt on a date palm plantation next to a spring called Río San Ignacio. At dusk, the desert air was warm and the spring water was a dark, serpentine green. Tim and I pushed off from the shore in a shared kayak and paddled past brown pelicans, a black cormorant and a lanky heron. Unripe dates hung in heavy bunches of green and yellow. At the end of the river, where the spring emerges from underground, kids splashed, only to fall silent as we approached, floating just above the surface like lurking alligators. The final 390-mile drive to La Paz includes one of the most magnetic stretches of the entire Transpeninsular, the coastline between Santa Rosalia and Loreto Bay. But we had arrived in  By the time we arrived in La Paz, it was dark. We pulled up at the hotel we’d plucked from our (now antique) Lonely Planet guidebook, the Hotel YNK, and found a  Because our time was brief, we raced to familiar places in the pouring rain. We ate oysters and drank beer at Bismark-cito, a seafood institution along La Paz’s waterfront. The next day, we drove a few miles to Playa El Tecolote, another beach where we had camped (and very nearly gotten stuck in the sand) years before. We snagged beach chairs, swam in the warm sea and indulged in still more fish tacos. We sucked every cerveza drop, every nostalgic moment from the last hours of our strange second honeymoon. And then, just like that, we were on the ferry, watching the Baja Peninsula sink into the Sea of Cortez.
