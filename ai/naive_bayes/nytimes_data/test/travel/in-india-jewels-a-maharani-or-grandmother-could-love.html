In India, Jewels a Maharani or Grandmother Could Love
On a recent trip to Jaipur, a global center for gem cutting, I indulged in visits to jewelry shops, as my grandmother often did.
===
My grandmother was an avid traveler, and in every place she visited — Bangkok, Cairo, Rome — she would buy a piece of jewelry. My sisters and I could rummage through her jewelry box, and take a virtual tour of the world. I still remember the woven silver earrings from Mexico and the black pearls from Tahiti. She was also quite fond of buying gold charms that she would attach to one of her gold chain bracelets. By the time my grandmother died in 1979 she had assembled three bracelets, which my sisters and I inherited, along with her affection for travel. So it seemed right that on a recent trip to India, I should try to see some of the country through my grandmother’s eyes by indulging in our mutual passion. The world’s largest consumer of gold, India is a country with a healthy appetite for personal adornment. That is most evident in  Jaipur is a typical Indian city, teeming with people and traffic. But even drivers of the humble three-wheeled moto-taxis know about the thousands of wholesalers and high-end retailers of jewelry. The most famous of all is the Gem Palace. Like seven generations before him, Munnu Kasliwal, who died at 57 in 2012, kept the Gem Palace in the news by providing baubles to the rich and famous and earning the sobriquet, “jeweler to the stars.” Now, his brother, Sanjay Kasliwal, is the principal designer and store cheerleader for the shop, which is equal parts store and museum. Despite that, he didn’t seem at all rushed when I stopped in unannounced and asked for a backstage tour. Gem Palace may look like a museum and feel like an exclusive enclave, with private drivers parked outside the guarded entrance doors, but it is open to the public with some modest items available for sale for less than $100. As Mr. Kasliwal showed me through a multistory warren of rooms, up one staircase and down another, he seemed as entertained by the behind-the-scenes visit as I was. We passed through rooms where gem cutters, polishers, setters and goldsmiths were turning his concepts into wearable art. The craftsmen were anywhere from in their early 30s to well into their 70s. Most sat cross-legged on the floor hovering over grinding wheels and beneath incandescent lights. On low tables, jewels that will soon be sold for thousands a carat were lying unceremoniously in dusty piles waiting for their turn to be made beautiful. After all that activity, the second-floor reception room was notably quiet. No high rollers were on the premises to shop in the ballroom-size, pillared room where kings, sheikhs and other V.I.P.s are coddled while running up six- and seven-figure tabs. I was soon to learn just whose derrières had graced the velvet chairs when Mr. Kasliwal pulled out the dusty autograph books bearing the signatures of historical and contemporary customers: Lord Louis Mountbatten, Errol Flynn, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Princess Grace. Mr. Kasliwal pointed them out with the same enthusiasm he had used for the dazzling necklaces. The books were on shelves; the jewelry was everywhere, in plastic leftover dishes and lying loose on desks. He would open a cabinet and pull out some fantastic rope of precious stones, gold and enamel. I was agog at a quadruple-strand pearl necklace with a diamond the size of a quarter, the back of the pendant as elaborate as the front. My grandmother could have carried off that necklace although she never could have afforded the $160,000 price. And as a consummate mixer of things from breakfast cereals to sewing patterns, she would have been thrilled by the dual nature of the gem-encrusted decorative metal cylinder that opened to become a cuff bracelet. At Sunita Shekhawat’s Midas Signature Jewellery shop, I discovered a niche of Indian jewelry specifically designed and sold for wedding parties. When I arrived on a Saturday afternoon, a bride-to-be in the company of her parents and aunts sat around an enormous marble table in the center of an equally large and modern cream-colored room with an occasional antique adding a rustic and stylish contrast. The families who come to Midas are there to buy custom-made pieces for the big day and maybe a few other momentous occasions. Selecting jewelry is no different from everything else associated with weddings in India; it is a family event and, fortunately for jewelers like Ms. Shekhawat, everyone gets something. When the wedding party left, Ms. Shekhawat pulled out a variety of different styles for me to examine: thick collar-shaped necklaces adorned with Polki (uncut) diamonds and set in enamel and cuff bracelets edged in jangly pearls. When I suggested I needed to see them on someone, her daughter, Niharika, 25, modeled them for me. Call them colorful, call them festive; they were anything but subtle. Niharika could pull off all that golden dazzle, but I wondered how they would be anything but overwhelming on a woman a little less of a glamourpuss — a middle-aged matron like me, for example. With that aesthetic in mind, Ms. Shekhawat, 52, has started producing some items with a little less flash, the kind of jewelry the fashion magazines describe as just right for “the office to a night on the town.” To her surprise these pieces are proving popular even with Indian women who are eager to get more wear out of the jewelry they own. A coral choker with a gold pendant, and a pearl necklace finished with a pair of enameled peacocks, were two stunning creations that might not elicit too much envious commentary at the workplace. My grandmother, on the other hand, would wear a heart-stopping double strand of opals that she called her “love beads” with a dress from Alexander’s (the T.J.Maxx of her generation) so I was sure she would have approved of my visit to Jashan Jewels, an established family business run by Pankhuri Dhingra. I found Jashan Jewels by calling Jaipur’s Pearl Academy of Design and asking for the names of former students who were changing the jewelry landscape in the city. Ms. Dhingra, 27, was happy to welcome me at her suburban three-story showroom and manufacturing plant. She said she understands that not everyone can afford gold and diamonds, so she is producing gold-plated jewelry using both familiar designs like the tear- and bell-shaped drop earrings and more streamlined geometric pieces. In workshops on the first floor, metal­smiths and stone setters produced a steady tap, tap, tap as they worked on one item at a time with the same care as they would if they were using more precious materials. This, Ms. Dhingra said, gives her costume jewelry its value. She explained all of this as we had lunch in her office, using her desk as a table. She opened a set of metal containers, the food within prepared and packed by her grandmother. It was kismet. “I thought you’d appreciate an authentic Indian lunch,” she said. It was a delicious demonstration of an appreciation for tradition, an approach she also takes with her parents’ company. “The pieces have the essence of old jewelry,” she said, “and it is Indian handcrafted so it looks all the more beautiful.” On my last day in Jaipur, I tagged along with two American expats I had met at breakfast at my hotel. Terry Ray Johnson and Phyllis Stuart had commissioned a hand-painted enamel pendant framed in silver, with a likeness of the spiritual teacher Sri Tathata, from Shivam Gems N Jewellery. We walked down from street level to a subterranean shop that was crammed full of display cases. Mr. Johnson said he planned to produce the pendant in quantity and sell it to other followers of the teacher as a business and spiritual enterprise. I hadn’t seen the traditional Indian art form of handcrafted painted enamel called meenakari, and Mr. Johnson invited me to have a look at the finished prototype. I immediately thought that this would appeal to anyone who has a photograph they want to wear as jewelry — from a beautiful landscape to a photo of the grandchildren. Besides custom pieces like the one it was making for Mr. Johnson, Shivam Gems N Jewellery was full of original and reproduction Indian tribal pieces, elaborate silver pendants adorned with jangly balls and bells. Kushor Kumar, a salesman known as Sunny, said his customers are mostly tourists who want to buy jewelry that will be a memento of their visit. I didn’t buy anything at Shivam or at any of the other shops I visited, as much as I admired the work. I knew I already had the best souvenir in my jewelry box back home. My grandmother’s charm bracelet was there, adorned with a tiny gold replica of the Taj Mahal.
