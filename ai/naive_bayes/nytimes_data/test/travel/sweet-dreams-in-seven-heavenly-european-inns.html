Sweet Dreams in Seven Heavenly European Inns
Hop from the coast of England to an island in Germany to an olive orchard in Italy, exploring a suite of value-priced properties.

When is a hotel a treasure? When it’s small enough to feel like home, whimsical enough to convey the local culture, warm enough to anticipate needs and surprising enough to refresh at first sight. It also helps to be value-priced, where the return of the experience exceeds the financial investment, an equation perfected by the following charmers. The Pig on the Beach, Studland, Dorset Opened this summer, the Pig on the Beach is the fourth of the cheap-and-chic Pigs, this time in beachy Studland on the south Dorset coast. The 23-room inn, a renovation of a former 19th-century hotel, overlooks the bay with the beach just five minutes’ walk away. Rooms range from tiny doubles under the eaves to more generous suites with chandeliers and free-standing tubs beside the beds. Two former shepherd’s huts make up a special suite, with a bed and fireplace in one, a bath in the other. A separate sheep hut houses the two-room spa. An on-site walled garden supplies much of the produce to the farm-to-fork restaurant; the rest comes from within a 25-mile radius. Rooms from 119 pounds, or $191 at $1.57 to the pound;  Hotel Citta dei Nicliani, Kolta, Mani Peninsula On the rugged Mani Peninsula, the central finger of the Peloponnese, the Sepsas family turned an 18th-century tower and surrounding stone buildings into a stylish seven-room inn, opened in 2012. Rooms vary in size and configuration, some with beamed ceilings and private terraces, but all feature stone walls, marble sinks and plush bedding. The family patriarch, Ilias Sepsas, a former oil industry engineer, does the cooking, inviting guests to join him in picking up fish and lobster from the local port. The rugged Mani region offers hikes to isolated canyons and a Byzantine church, and the family will arrange complimentary visits to area olive groves during the October-to-December harvest. Doubles from $120, including breakfast;  Moy House, Lahinch, County Clare A waterfront country estate, the nine-room Moy House blends elegant appointments — linen- and silver-topped dinner tables, canopied beds and an antiques-filled living room — with homey touches, including an honesty bar in the living room, rubber boots to borrow by the door and a breakfast tray brought to the room for anyone “having a lie-in.” Fifteen undeveloped acres surround the 19th-century whitewashed house overlooking Lahinch Bay, ideal for beachcombers and nature lovers, with local sights including the Cliffs of Moher and Burren National Park nearby. Doubles from 165 euros, about $202, at $1.23 to the euro, including breakfast. Masseria Bosco, Avetrana, Puglia A 37-acre olive orchard surrounds the ancient Masseria Bosco, a former farmhouse and barnyard that dates to the 16th century. Converted into a rural resort in 2001, the stone buildings now house 12 rooms, each uniquely configured, most with high vaulted ceilings, tiled floors, wrought-iron beds and rustic wood chests and chairs. The former barn and shepherd quarters house the dining room and kitchen, supplied with produce from an on-site kitchen garden and estate-grown olive oil. Solar panels heat water throughout the hotel and warm the generous outdoor pool. Doubles from 110 euros, including breakfast;   Posada del Valle, Collia, Asturias In the Picos de Europa mountains in northern Spain, the 12-room Posada del Valle encompasses a 19th-century former farmhouse and an 18-acre organic garden, attracting both highland trekkers and slow-foodies. Nigel and Joann Burch, British expats, offer six rooms in the original building with exposed stone walls and shuttered windows, and six larger rooms in a newer addition. The couple raise their own produce, lambs and eggs, offering multicourse seasonal dinners. Guests can access a number of hiking trails directly from the inn, schedule Spanish lessons or attend one of the inn’s special retreats devoted to cooking, art or crafts held throughout the year. Doubles from 66 euros; breakfast 9 euros, dinner 26 euros;  Mein Inselglück, Reichenau Island, Lake Constance Though Reichenau Island in southern Germany’s Lake Constance is known for its vegetable farms, the Deggelmann and Staiger families decided theirs was too small to run economically and instead erected the 32-room Mein Inselglück, meaning “My Happiness Island,” which opened in April. The modernist compound groups rooms around a courtyard with ample terraces and walkways to encourage wandering outdoors. Indoors, streamlined rooms feature blond wood paneling on walls and bed frames, with glass-enclosed showers in the bathrooms. Floor-to-ceiling windows surround the modern bistro, which serves meals throughout the day, and a small spa offers massages, a sauna, steam room and infrared-heated cabin. The innkeepers rent bikes for exploring the 1.7-square-mile island, also home to the Abbey of Reichenau, a Unesco World Heritage site. Doubles from 130 euros, which includes breakfast;  Fazenda Nova, Estiramantens, Algarve Set on 25 acres near Tavira on the eastern end of the Algarve, the two-year-old Fazenda Nova houses 10 rooms and a restaurant in a renovated country home. Modern and classical elements meet in guest rooms featuring terra-cotta-tiled floors, Balinese four-poster beds and animal hide rugs, with polished concrete walls and glass-doored showers in the bathroom. All but one room opens onto a private terrace, and garden paths offer shady spots under olive and almond trees for bird-watchers and bookworms. A pool, library and restaurant focusing on local seafood defy guests to leave for entertainment. Rooms from 160 euros;
