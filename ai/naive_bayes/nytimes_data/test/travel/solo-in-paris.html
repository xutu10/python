Solo in Paris
There is a version of the city that deeply rewards a traveler willing to explore it alone.
===
Some go to La Coupole, the 87-year-old Art Deco brasserie in Montparnasse, to commune with friends; others, to dine with ghosts — Picasso, Piaf, Sartre, all former patrons. I went alone, to live in the present. I sliced through an oyster with my cocktail fork, loosening it from its shell. A pulpy Utah Beach, it was brimming with lemon juice and its own slightly salty liquor. I lifted it with a thumb and forefinger, and tilted it to my lips. It was early spring in Paris. To my left, a white-haired woman with red lipstick disappeared behind a newspaper. To my right, a man and a woman flirted over starters. We were at the center of one of the last sprawling brasseries of the 1920s, where a large basin into which the artists’ model Kiki de Montparnasse used to climb has been replaced with a comparatively demure sculpture of a couple forming an orb with their outstretched limbs. A waiter paused at my table to rotate the platter of oysters so that the overturned shells faced the empty chair across from me. “Voilà,” he said. I leaned back against the banquette, bathed in the whir of nearby tête-à-têtes, sipping my Chablis. It was easy in Paris to surrender to the moment. But why? What alchemy transmuted ordinary activities, be it a walk across a bridge or the unwrapping of butter, into a pleasure? My default speed in New York is “hurtle,” yet in Paris I dragged the edge of a fork across an oyster with a care better suited to sliding a bow across a violin. This was not simply because I was in Paris, though it has long held a kind of magic for many Americans. It was because I was there on my own. In a city that has been perfecting beauty since the reign of Napoleon III, there are innumerable sensual details — patterns, textures, colors, sounds — that can be diluted, even missed, when chattering with someone or collaborating on an itinerary. Alone one becomes acutely aware of the hollow clack of pétanque balls in a park; the patina of Maillol’s bronze “Baigneuse se Coiffant” that makes her look wet even on a cloudless day in the Tuileries; how each of the empty wine bottles beside sidewalk recycling bins is the embodiment of someone’s good time. There is a Paris that deeply rewards the solo traveler. Indeed, the city has a centuries-old tradition of solo exploration, personified by the flâneur, or stroller. Flânerie is, in its purest form, a goal-less pursuit, though for some it evolved into a purposeful art: Walking and observing became a method of understanding a city, an age. Baudelaire described the flâneur as a passionate spectator, one who was fond of “botanizing on the asphalt,” as the essayist Walter Benjamin would later put it. Typically, it was a man. No longer. To be a sidewalk botanist, one must walk. But please, no sneakers. C’est Paris. A fashion journalist friend suggested I be slightly transgressive and don a men’s shoe. A nod to my predecessors. This is how I came to average 20 miles a day in bronze cap-toe oxfords. Those who are not first-time visitors should skip some of the banner attractions to make room for impromptu discoveries. Get lost, drink, snub the “Mona Lisa.” The Salle des États room at the Louvre where the da Vinci painting hangs is so mobbed that any transcendent moment one might hope to have in its presence is snuffed out. In the spirit of flânerie, everything — not just museum objects — is worth seeing. Because I believe that, I awoke each morning indecisive about which direction to walk despite having vacationed in Paris several times and knowing enough rudimentary French to wander with confidence. On a Thursday in April, I chose north. Looking uphill from the corner of Boulevard Haussmann and Rue Laffitte, the Sacré-Coeur Basilica seemed to rise in the distance like Oz. I took Rue Laffitte toward Rue des Martyrs, an approximately half-mile artery with food shops, vintage boutiques and bistros named for St. Denis, a bishop who during the Roman Empire was decapitated and, according to legend, carried his head the length of the street. I was there browsing for picnic provisions. This neighborhood south of Montmartre is known nowadays as SoPi (South Pigalle), and its influx of cocktail bars has drawn bourgeois bohemians, along with some comparisons to the Marais. I like it because it retains a whiff of helter-skelter medieval Paris, when the city was truly a flâneur’s wonderland. I walked the wet street past cafes coming to life, fruit stands and open storefronts with sunny awnings like one that said Fromager Chataigner (3, rue des Martyrs), where a table of cheeses lured me from the sidewalk. A couple of old men were making small talk with the proprietor as I pointed to a block decorated with three sprigs of lavender (now pressed between the pages of my notebook). The shopkeeper wrapped the cheese in a blue-and-white line drawing of a milkmaid, a bow atop her head, a flower underfoot and a pail in each hand. I would have plunked down my euros for just the wrapping. Tourists zigzag through this area on their way to Sacré-Coeur and the precipitous streets of stairs that Fred Astaire dashed up in the 1957 movie musical “Funny Face.” But walk there and rather than belt out “Bonjour, Paris!,” one is more likely to be slogging behind busloads of visitors and trying to shake off the city’s more aggressive hucksters. On the Rue des Martyrs I strolled up to the pine-green-and-gold storefront of Sébastien Gaudard (No. 22), who worked at Fauchon and Le Bon Marché before opening Patisserie des Martyrs. His tarte au citron — with a practically translucent slice of lemon on top — strikes the right balance between sweet crust and tangy cream. I crossed the street, trading the shop’s pale-blue interior for the hot-pink accents of Arnaud Delmontel (No. 39). A baker and pâtissier, Mr. Delmontel won first prize for the best baguette in Paris in 2007 with his La Renaissance baguette. How could I not smile as I walked the streets with a warm Renaissance in my hand? One can pursue such gustatory indulgences all the way up to Rue Foyatier, the more than 200 steps that lead to Sacré-Coeur. If the weather turns, forage at Lafayette Gourmet instead, the indoor market where Eric Kayser proffers crisp croissants, and the shelves are stocked with Bordier butter. At Tafa, the Chinese take-away station, the vegetarian dumplings are savory yet light. It seemed that time had slowed. In certain ways, Paris felt like New York after a couple of glasses of wine. Or as Edmund White tells a fellow American in “Inside a Pearl: My Years in Paris”: “To me it seems so calm after New York. As if I’d already died and gone to heaven.” Even so, the Seine is like a reverse mood ring. Whether it is placid and giving, or green-gray and angry, one synchronizes with its whims. And I did as I walked west along its left bank one blustery morning to the Musée du Quai Branly, where a nearly 40-foot glass wall shelters the building, designed by Jean Nouvel, from traffic. The Branly describes its collection as “non-European objects from Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas,” though it has been criticized for lacking context (at its opening in 2006 The New York Times called it “a kind of ghetto for the ‘other’ ”). Outside, long grasses and oak and cherry trees are a welcome change from the city’s formal trimmed gardens. And at the indoor-outdoor cafe (go for tea, not the unremarkable food), most tables come with a view of the Eiffel Tower. I intended to avoid visiting the tower, but some landmarks exert a gravitational pull. Despite being content to admire it from afar, I found myself moving ever closer. I left the Branly not by following the exit signs toward the Seine but by going out the back, turning right onto Rue de l’Université to approach the tower from a side street rather than the Seine or the Parc du Champ-de-Mars, as most visitors do. From here, its vastness is accentuated by the buildings in its shadow. One feels like Jack looking up at the beanstalk. For vistas that include the Eiffel Tower, visit Tour Montparnasse in the 15th Arrondissement, which, while considered an eyesore by Parisians, is among the highest observation points in the city and makes all of Paris look like the theater set that it is. From there, a 15-minute stroll leads to the Luxembourg Gardens. I bought a café crème late one afternoon and lingered on a chair until the after-work crowd descended. “Mademoiselle, bonjour,” said the man next to me as I stood up. “Bonsoir, monsieur,” I said over my shoulder, not of a mind to banter but to wander, this time past statues of queens, daffodils and the vintage merry-go-round. What could be sweeter, I thought as I walked into a cloud of gnats. I emerged to find one floating in my café crème. C’est la vie. I tossed the coffee in the trash and drifted over to pétanque courts, where games were being played with earnestness by clusters of graying men, some in berets, their dark jackets dangling from metal courtside racks, more orderly than many restaurant coat-check rooms. The gardens are in the Sixth Arrondissement, which includes St.-Germain-des-Prés, though it is no longer the ganglion of Existentialism it was in the 1940s and ’50s. Like much of Paris it is a kind of museum en plein air — a place to fantasize about what it was like when Camus, Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir wrote and drank at Café de Flore. They could not have afforded to live there now or to shop at “concept stores” like Colette on the Rue St.-Honoré or, over in the Haut-Marais, at Merci. Perhaps Citypharma, where Frenchwomen flock for some of the lowest prices on mass beauty brands like Nuxe and Avène, would be an exception. I fought through narrow aisles among women who had no problem pushing me aside or briefly placing their shopping basket on my head if I happened to be crouching below them, although always with a polite “excusez-moi.” It is hot. It is crowded. It is a class in French sociology. To refuel, I stopped by a favorite among my friends, Le Comptoir du Relais, a cozy maroon bistro where English is hardly spoken. I walked in around 4:30, which meant I had no trouble getting lunch. Tall panes of glass were flung open, letting in the sidewalk, the better for gawking at passers-by, which I did shamelessly while eating salmon with wasabi and turnips. Places like this, where one looks out as others look in, are ideal for solo travelers. I had that exquisite feeling described by Baudelaire in “The Painter of Modern Life,” in which you “see the world,” are “at the center of the world,” and yet “remain hidden from the world.” Le Comptoir is a five-minute walk from the Musée de Cluny, where I did not intend to go. I was on my way to the Institut du Monde Arabe, where a glass elevator floats to a rooftop restaurant overlooking the Seine and its islands. Clouds had moved in, and in my thin blouse, I was chilled. I plopped down in the Cluny’s “jardin d’amour” to get my bearings. Alas, no matter my mood, I cannot resist reading museum signs. It wasn’t long before I was standing in front of a series of posters built into a latticework fence that told of how medieval gardens were meant to embody the search for pleasure on earth. Leaning against the lower right corner of the last sign, I saw a book sealed in a plastic bag. I picked it up. I put it down. I turned to see if anyone was watching. Not the old woman smoking. Not the couple canoodling. It was a mystery novel — “L’affaire est close” — with its own mystery. I pressed it to my chest and retreated down a sunken lane out of the garden. I had taken the book, by Patricia Wentworth, because I recognized the sticker on the cover:  The protagonist is Miss Silver, one of the earliest female sleuths, along with Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple. I chose to believe the book was meant for me, given that Walter Benjamin likened the flâneur to a detective. But the role of investigator can at times be uncomfortable. As I slipped into a black dress before a performance of Rossini’s “L’Italiana in Algeri,” I told myself that attending an opera at the Palais Garnier alone was no different from attending, say, a Broadway show alone. But the opulence of the ornate 139-year-old space — the frescoes, the chandeliers, the gilded statues, the white marble grand staircase, the Marc Chagall painting on the auditorium ceiling — can feel intimidating. Moreover, I had a seat in a box: a plush crimson closet that one shares with six strangers. I felt sorry for the French couple inches in front of me. My legs were in between their laps; were he to carelessly reach for her hand, he would graze my kneecap. The claret-cushioned chairs were arranged two, two, two and then — at the rear of the box centered between all of the coupled seats — was a single chair: mine. I was delighted. While almost everyone else was shifting to get comfortable or see better, I had a clear shot of the stage between their heads. And there was room behind me. I could easily turn my body toward the door — its porthole window concealed by a red curtain — and stretch my legs in an occasionally unladylike manner because no one knew what I was up to back there. Why, there was a velvet bench, had I wanted to lie down. The box is a sensualist’s dream, which I explored when the lights went out. I ran my fingers along the satiny walls, hoping that if there was a phantom of the opera he would materialize and take me to dinner because I was starving. I didn’t find an opera ghost in the box, though I did find another solo traveler. A woman from Germany was there on her own, as was a woman from England who had a daughter elsewhere in the hall. During intermission the German traveler marveled at the way the box allowed her to observe the orchestra seats below. “You can watch everybody,” she said to the Englishwoman, who replied with greater precision: “Watch,” she said, “and be watched.” That’s true throughout Paris, but it is executed with particular flair during intermission at the Palais Garnier when everyone swarms the bar and the balconies around the grand staircase to drink and feast their eyes on one another — and perhaps experience the cinematic thrill of peering over the crowd and catching the eye of a stranger glancing back. When the performance onstage was over, the one offstage recommenced as everyone descended the marble stairs to the grand foyer. Resisting an ending, and giving the phantom a last opportunity to appear, I stood outside the opera house, pulling my trench coat around me as I lifted my gaze toward the roof and the golden sculptures, Poetry and Harmony, against the inky sky. Another night, for something more contemporary, I went to the Palais de Tokyo, an experimental art space where I saw installations that were ... frankly, I’m not sure what they were. One used video and sculpture “to create allegorical tales.” At one point I rounded a corner and saw a vacuum. Or perhaps it was a floor buffer. I still don’t know if it was art or a vacuum, but the Palais de Tokyo is one of the few places in Paris that feels of the moment, whether or not you connect with a particular work. And if the art’s not for you, the music performances can be excellent. For club and live music, there’s Le Comptoir Général, which bills itself as a “temple of ghetto culture.” Hidden behind a painted wall along the Canal St.-Martin, it is open until 1 a.m. almost every night and offers street food and art from marginalized places amid rooms in a sprawling barn and garden. Still, for me, Paris is about the public spaces. On my last morning there, I pushed through a metal gate into the Jardin des Tuileries. There was dew on the vacant green chairs. Wind was blowing red and purple tulips every which way, and shuttered cafes were only just taking the day’s deliveries from solitary trucks. It was quiet enough to hear the splash of a fountain. The question that bubbled up was not so much, Will I be back?, but rather, Could I bring back with me the feeling that I had cultivated here? At my feet, two men with a wheelbarrow were tending to the tulips. I saw a shadow of myself on the dirt path, and of the buds on delicate branches above me, on the verge of opening. I looked down at my oxfords, covered in a fine layer of dust.
