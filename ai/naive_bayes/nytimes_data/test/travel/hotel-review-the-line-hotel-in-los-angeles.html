Rooms start at $249. This vibrant new hotel sets out to capture the 24-hour energy of the Koreatown neighborhood in Los Angeles. Opened in January, it was created by the Sydell Group, the team behind the Ace and NoMad hotels in New York. Occupying a 12-story, midcentury modernist tower originally designed by the venerable Los Angeles architecture firm Daniel Mann Johnson & Mendenhall, the Line retains some of the stripped-concrete walls and industrial-chic aesthetic. The expansive lobby has double-height windows, a textured-ceiling installation made of old T-shirts, and swooping, curved surfaces, with banquettes to tuck into and a bar area anchoring the rear. An international newsstand and boutique, Poketo, is curated by the husband-and-wife design collective Angie Myung and Ted Vadakan. Though not everything was open during my stay earlier this year, the hotel was already cultivating its clientele, which includes locals dropping in for a drink, stylish Asian 20-somethings and perfectly coifed Korean flight attendants, who arrived by shuttle bus from Los Angeles International Airport and received a royal welcome. On the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Normandie Avenue in the heart of Koreatown, within walking distance of an impressive array of restaurants, bars and clubs. A Metro station is close by. A soothing oasis above the action below, with fantastic floor-to-ceiling views of the Hollywood Hills and the Griffith Observatory; late in the day, moody afternoon light cuts across a swath of palm trees in the foreground. Custom platform beds are positioned to make the most of that view, and have built-in headboard desks of bleached ash wood; pretty stitched-quilt and canvas ottomans are pushed into the corners but can be pulled around the room. Art and lamps are hung low and, along with knee-level tables and chairs, make for a lounge feel. When seen from the hotel exterior, the automated blackout shades reveal themselves in a whimsical palette of colors like an art installation. Toiletries are customized for the hotel by Baxter of California. The décor — pale woods, white tile, a wooden shower stool, gold fixtures that verge on gaudy — is reminiscent of the excellent Korean day spas in the neighborhood. For the full spa effect, don the white cotton robe and slippers provided. A collaboration with the street-food king Roy Choi has brought a series of restaurants to the premises, including Pot, specializing in Korean hotpots, and Commissary, emphasizing vegetables. A bakery-focused cafe serves red-bean buns and butter-mochi cakes, and a lobby bar offers adventurous cocktails with central ingredients like arugula, curry and kimchi, as well as more traditional beverages. There’s free Wi-Fi throughout the property. A fourth-floor fitness center is equipped with cardio machines and free weights, and guests have free three-hour use of the in-house fleet of bespoke Linus bicycles, complete with helmets, saddlebags and locks. Available from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., but Choi’s in-house restaurants (not to mention Koreatown itself) are your oyster. This new hotel is shaping up to be the “it” location for night owls and adventurous omnivores. Its biggest accomplishment is introducing visitors to the gems of little-known Koreatown.
