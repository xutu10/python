36 Hours in Whistler, British Columbia
With a boost from the 2010 Winter Olympics, Whistler-Blackcomb has grown up, drawing an international crowd and giving them plenty of options.
===
With apologies to Aspen,  1. “We have fast ice today,” Philippe Melun, sport and guest services supervisor at the Whistler Sliding Center, said recently as his staff handed out helmets. The center was home to bobsleigh, luge and skeleton events during the Winter Olympics. Now you can try a sport you’ve always wondered about: skeleton, a facedown, headfirst rocket ride on the last third of “the fastest track in the world.” Participants reach speeds of more than 60 miles an hour in the 20-second ride, then, addicted to the speed, strip off clothes to beat their time on the second try (169 Canadian dollars, $150, at 1.10 Canadian to the U.S. dollar; reservations recommended). 2. It’s a chore to find good Mexican food north of Salt Lake City, so hopes don’t run high for north of the 49th Parallel. And the faux stucco walls and hacienda tiles at the Mexican Corner send the vibe of yet another watered-down, Tex-Mex experience. But try the guacamole, which is studded with pomegranate seeds, and bears a whiff of — is it? — truffle oil. Open the menu. See items like “pre-Hispanic mixote,” or lamb seasoned with Mexican sun-dried chiles and steamed in banana leaves. This is anything but watered-down Tex-Mex food. 3.  You need savory fuel before skiing. Elements Urban Tapas Parlour, a locals’ favorite that’s also off the main pedestrian street, opens before the lifts do. This ain’t your a.m. hash house: Make the tough decision between several versions of the popular eggs Benedict (12 to 14 dollars) served with a potato tartlet, and the decadent honey ham and Brie French toast (15 dollars), and meaty English breakfast stack with roast tomato, portobello, duck sausage and double-smoked bacon (15 dollars). 4.  The terrain that makes Whistler-Blackcomb a ski-movie darling can also be intimidating. In its two-day Steep Skiing Clinics (429 dollars plus tax), 20-year-old Extremely Canadian pairs black-diamond skiers with experts like Wendy Brookbank, the friendly, caffeinated former star of Warren Miller ski movies, to teach them how to handle the tilted terrain that crowns Whistler and Blackcomb mountains. Think of it as spending time with a cool local who shows you all the tough ski lines that never appear on a trail map, like Bushrat and Zoot Zoot, while Ms. Brookbank dispenses tips for mastering the most challenging terrain. A free nugget: The steeper it gets, the more you must resist common sense and lean away from the mountain. 5.  The Garibaldi Lift Company doesn’t seem like much — a wedge of a place at the base of Whistler mountain, a floor above the gondola station. But “the GLC” is many locals’ favorite place for yardlong nachos (26 dollars) after skiing. Want to fit in? Order a Bloody Caesar, which is practically Canada’s national cocktail. The GLC makes several varieties. The Great Canadian Caesar (all 8.75 dollars) is an umami bomb of a drink, perfect after a day on the slopes: vodka, Clamato (clam-tomato) juice, Tabasco, Worcestershire sauce. Or order the Pacific Rim Caesar, with gin, sriracha and cilantro-oyster sauce purée. 6.  At Scandinave Spa (58 dollars) the guidelines are blunt: You will be silent during your stay. It’s as much threat as suggestion. The annoyance soon fades. The spa — think Scandinavian wellness meets Japanese onsen — is designed so visitors move from hot rooms (a large eucalyptus steam room; dry sauna; outdoor saltwater pools heated to 102 degrees) to cold plunge pools to mellow recovery rooms with Adirondack chairs. Sweat, shiver, repeat. Even a non-spa fan must concede the place is lovely, especially come evening as the snow falls among the cedars and robed spagoers look like monks as they move silently through the mists rising from terraced pools. 7.  Get off the main drag (the Village Stroll) with its Gap and North Face stores. Seek out the side streets, where the food is often better and the prices are lower. Exhibit A: four-year-old Alta Bistro, a modern French bistro, serves creative food and serious wines at reasonable prices. The jars of pickled vegetables lining one wall hint at the owners’ farm-to-table efforts: the deconstructed winter salad (13 dollars) features root vegetables from a farm in nearby Pemberton. Or try the superstar salad of pork belly and Dungeness crab (17 dollars) with avocado and grapefruit — a pitch-perfect combo that’s salty, sweet, acidic — and it’s even better when paired with an eclectic Spanish white you’ve never heard of. 8.  Half the fun of skiing in the Swiss Alps is to stop by the local Bäckerei for a warm roll. Now Whistler has its own great bakery: Pure­bread sells two dozen breads with names like “seriously seedy” and “lavender rosemary.” But you’re here for the town’s best espresso from Stumptown and to fuel up on sugar buns and scones, such as buckwheat sour cherry (3.50 dollars), a local favorite. Post-skiing, try a pesto mozzarella stud muffin (3.50 dollars) or Adults Only cookie (3 dollars) with chocolate, sea salt and rosemary. A fire gutted Purebread’s first village location a year ago, but it reopened Dec. 1. 9 How about a lesson from an Olympian, and to hear what really happens in the Athletes’ Village? Whistler Blackcomb celebrates its legacy as a host of the 2010 Winter Olympics Games with the return of its Ski or Ride With an Olympian program. If you’ve got the dough you can hire an Olympian, such as the 2010 ski cross gold medalist Ashleigh McIvor or the Canadian downhill legend Rob Boyd, to be your full-day guide — with line-cutting privileges. Cost: 899 dollars for a group of up to five (pricing upon request for gold medalists). 10.  Australians love their meat pies. So it was a natural, given the huge number of Aussies who come to Whistler to work and ski, that an Australian and her partner would open Peaked Pies, tucked off the main shopping street. These pies are winners. A flaky, buttery crust encases fillings like steak, bacon and cheese (6.75 dollars), or even minced kangaroo meat (rich in omega-3s!). Try one “peaked” : topped with a summit of mashed potatoes, “mushy peas” and a brown gravy that runs down the mound like ski trails (3.25 dollars additional). 11.  The grand hotel seems an idea of yesteryear — ditto the hotel bar as locus of all the après-ski action. That’s untrue at the Fairmont Chateau Whistler. Life revolves around the Fairmont’s Mallard Lounge, especially when the lifts close: Huge windows open onto the snowy scene and to a patio where fires burn. And while the Mallard’s stuffed ducks and wood paneling suggest stuffiness, the clomp of little ski boots and the guy strumming Fleetwood Mac keep the atmosphere friendly and lodgelike. Order a Hog Heaven (porchetta with caramelized sous vide pork belly and smoked bacon, 25 dollars) or try the house-made chocolates, and settle in. Be cautious: at 21 dollars for a Vesper cocktail with a house-made version of Lillet, prices add up fast. 12.  Before dinner bundle up the kids and drag them into the shivery cold and to the base of the ski lifts for the free Fire and Ice Show in Skier’s Plaza at the base of Whistler Mountain. There, to the soundtrack of thumping music, some of the area’s best skiers fling themselves off a huge jump and perform “cab 540s,” “flat-spin 3s,” back flips and other orthopedists’ dreams — all while the crowd oohs and aahs its approval. Stay long enough and you’ll see them jump through a hoop of fire while fire-dancers, apparently with nothing to do till Burning Man, twirl flames nearby. It’s absurd, of course. And Junior will eat it up — until his feet get cold.
