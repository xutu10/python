Mud, Worms and Ropes: A One-Day Survival Course
A class from the Bear Grylls Survival Academy teaches participants tricks for negotiating the wild.
===
When foraging in the wild, one of the best reliable sources of protein is an earthworm. To serve: Use your fingers to wring the slime past the midsection. Snap off the bottom half — mostly intestines anyway — and put the rest in your mouth. Swallow quickly so it doesn’t wiggle on the way down. This morsel was just one takeaway from my stint navigating the Colorado Rockies as part of the Bear Grylls Survival Academy 24-Hour Adult Course, an expedition branded by the adventure travel television host that teaches grown-ups to fend for themselves in the wild. (Course leaders call the process “self-rescue.”) An expansion of Mr. Grylls’s successful academy in Britain, the course is fairly new to the United States, where sessions in California and the Catskills in addition to Colorado have started this year. Survival skill classes are nothing new, of course, but few bear the imprimatur of someone like Mr. Grylls, an Eton-educated, record-setting adventurer described reverentially by one of the leaders of my nine-person expedition as “the kind of guy that takes a catnap in a piece of bark, wakes up to behead a poisonous snake about to bite, and then sticks the head in his knapsack for a keepsake before moving on.” (Right,  Through his camps, Mr. Grylls is reaching out to the common man (indeed, participants on these trips so far are mostly men) trying to take the leap from merely watching his tricks on TV to giving them a go in the field, albeit in a rather user-friendly way. (Reaching out from afar, that is, because Mr. Grylls keeps a busy schedule that includes hosting shows like  Despite the target audience of neophyte adventurers, the guys on my expedition, which cost $399, were not exactly being wrestled from their Lay-Z-Boys. One bounded unprodded into a patch of tall grass and exclaimed “a grasshopper!” before catching it (“a juvenile!”), popping off its head and then impaling it on a hand-chiseled birch skewer to barbecue later over the fire he built from flint and pine needles. He fit right in. From the time we were carted to a random kickoff spot in the woods and told to blend in by slicking mud all over our skin, the experience was an exercise in applied survival. Inevitably, food figured highly in the lesson plan. We were taught a sequence for determining if plants are safe to eat, admonished that “there’s a difference between poisonous and palatable.” A plant may look innocent enough, but to know for sure, you need to start by smelling it (a scent like peaches or almonds could indicate cyanide, as in apple seeds). Then you rub the specimen on your skin, and later on your lips and in your mouth. So far, so good? Chew it up and swallow. If you’re still sentient five hours later, whatever you just ingested is probably fine. The guides recommended nominating one person per group to undertake the poison test; a modern-day cup bearer of the bush. We did not all jump at once. We did, however, set off to forage. I learned that pine nuts come not from plastic bags but from pine cones. You can eat a thistle, but if you stuff yourself with certain pods of peas, they might paralyze you. The woods became a salad bar, and a gantlet. We also learned water safety basics; the leaders told us to use a sock to help filter what we collected from a stream. “If you have chunks in your water, you can purify all you want but the inside of the chunk could still be contaminated,” one explained. I needed little other rationale for avoiding chunks in my water, but gamely nodded anyway. We absorbed a virtual encyclopedia of knots (“alpine butterfly,” “figure eight”). Things you might learn as a Brownie and then promptly forget. With just the flint on our hunting knives, we steadfastly built fires. My teammates, more Eagle Scout caliber, had far better luck than any Jack London hero. The guides had strung two rabbits from a tree for our dinner. As the carcasses, frozen in the throes of rigor mortis, stretched out on a log, we butchered them from head to paw, and skewered them on sticks I thought we had whittled to roast marshmallows. In the end, we wasted nothing. We knew exactly where each bit of meat came from. In another exercise, we crossed a riverbed aided only by two ropes strung one above the other, as in the crocodile scene from “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.” So what if we were only about 20 feet up and the river was mostly dry? As I watched my teammates wobble across, I was deeply aware that I am no Dr. Jones. I pictured myself inverting, suspended parallel over the riverbed, prostrate like a flying squirrel. “What, they don’t have this in Manhattan?” teased one of the guides as I shuffled by. Thunder rumbled. Ten minutes after clearing the expanse, I determined that my appendages had stopped shaking. My heart less so, but I attributed that to the altitude. Other lessons were even harder. At one point, we were told to build shelters for the night. Our instructions: Keep in mind the prevailing winds when situating your shelter’s opening. Do not build your shelter where water has flowed. Avoid hazards. We had 40 minutes. Any questions? I had one. “What do we build them out of?” I didn’t see camping equipment. The answer: “Anything you can find. Go.” Instantly everyone scattered. The trip had spiraled into a bush edition of “Hunger Games,” everyone snatching the best resources, branching into alliances of convenience I had not even realized they’d forged. I panicked momentarily — no one seemed eager to risk the dryness of his sleeping quarters by investing in the improvised pine-needle roof-thatching skills of the urban interloper. Then I saw that the self-designated group M.V.P., his face still caked with opening-exercise mud, certainly by design rather than happenstance, had staked out a downy patch of pine needles in a clearing. “I’m building a mansion,” he announced to no one in particular. I hastily apprenticed myself as a roommate, and we set about piling sticks into the exoskeleton of a lean-to. “Remember, one layer on the bottom is worth two on top,” he advised as he scattered pine needles on the floor of our makeshift shelter to ward off the midnight cold. He was showing off, but he was right. We slept great; I knocked my head into a low-hanging pine knob only twice and I barely remember anyway. The class promises extremity — for a grown-up indoor kid, it could be revelatory — but overall it is more Bushwhacking 101. You learn a lot of tricks, but if you can’t execute them you’re never far from help. There is a lot of hiking; I was confused when I didn’t see a path but eventually caught on that that was the point. You have to hoist yourself up rock faces and scramble down boulders. None of it’s easy, but anyone worth her 5k finisher’s medal can pull it off. The company provides all gear. And if your self-rescue is more of a swan dive, nobody’s going to leave you foundering in the woods. At the end of the trip, we had to walk through a mountain lake on our path to self-rescue. “Put everything you don’t want wet in your dry bag,” we were told. I did not fit in my dry bag. The exercise was gratuitous — you could see camp on the near side of the lake, we were taking the long way — and yet the message was clear. Sometimes the long way is the most rewarding.
