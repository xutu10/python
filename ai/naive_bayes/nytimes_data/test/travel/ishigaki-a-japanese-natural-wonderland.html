Ishigaki, a Japanese Natural Wonderland
The remote island’s unspoiled beaches, coral reefs, tropical vistas and other splendors lead some to call it “the most beautiful place in Japan.”

Unruly stalks brushed against the windows of the white Suzuki minivan as it bumped down an unmarked dirt road through a field of sugar cane. When the road abruptly ended, we continued on foot down a barely perceptible path through thick tropical foliage, fighting through branches and brush. And then there it was: a tiny secluded cove with smooth white sand spread between rocky outcroppings and the Pacific Ocean’s million shades of blue. “There are many secret beaches on Ishigaki, but this one is my favorite,” said Haruna Miyaji, a local music teacher and my unofficial tour guide for the day, as we stood on the deserted beach, admiring the scene. It was early January when my husband and I made the journey to Ishigaki, a beautiful Japanese island over 1,200 miles southwest of Tokyo. At the tail end of a string of volcanic islands that stretches southwest toward Taiwan, Ishigaki is the main hub of the remote Yaeyama Islands. The population of about 50,000 is concentrated in the town of Ishigaki, a decidedly unattractive urban pocket on the island’s southern edge that is home to many restaurants, bars, shops and hotels, as well as a small port from which ferries depart for nearby islands. But the rest of Ishigaki, which covers about the same area as Martha’s Vineyard, is a wonderland of nature rightfully revered among the Japanese: unspoiled beaches, coral reefs in dazzlingly clear waters, palm tree forests, pineapple plantations and tropical vistas that are rarely associated with  The refrain that I heard repeated over and over was: “It’s the most beautiful place in Japan.” So it’s little wonder that the laid-back island has become an increasingly desirable destination for Japanese seeking an escape from the country’s dense metropolises. A new airport that opened last year now offers more direct flights from cities across Japan (including flights from Kansai on Japan’s new low-cost airline, Peach), making the island easier to reach. But the appeal of Ishigaki has turned many temporary visits into permanent stays. “I didn’t like the big city,” said Masahiro Kurihara, a longtime resident originally from Tokyo. Kuri, as everyone calls him, has owned Cafe Taniwha, a no-frills neighborhood bar, with his wife, Fusa, for the last 15 years. He said that what drew him to Ishigaki was the slower pace of life, the nearby mountains, the low cost of living, and “the sea, the beautiful sea.” Another part of the island’s appeal is the friendliness of the locals. Time and again, I observed that the local residents were noticeably warmer than those I’ve met elsewhere in Japan. After a chat with Kuri in the empty cafe on a cloudy afternoon, he invited us to return that evening for a belated New Year’s party. And when a regular appeared at the door bearing a gift — fluffy cake filled with purple jam, still warm and wrapped in newspaper — he insisted we each take a slice. “All my customers are friends,” he explained. “I know everybody’s name.” Soon we would, too, when we returned to the packed bar after dark and sat down beside Toncho, a colorful local resident who was tending to a simmering pot of nabe. Other guests approached us with smiles, pressing gifts into our hands — mini bananas, mochi, mikan (citrus fruit similar to clementines), chewy strips of dried squid and sesame. But conversation lagged until an unlikely common language was stumbled upon: Italian. Originally from Osaka, Sanae Yoshida lived in Milan before moving to Ishigaki in search of “la vita lenta,” or the slow life. She explained that the island, once virtually unknown among the Japanese, began attracting growing numbers of city dwellers over the last two decades. Now, she said, the island was home to many transplants. Another transplant we met that night was our eventual tour guide, Haruna, originally from Takamatsu, who was one of the few English-speakers in the crowd. When she discovered that we were relying on public transportation — without an international driving permit, we couldn’t rent a car — she offered to show us around. So two mornings later, we met her and her boyfriend at the time, Sada (the couple has since married), and headed north on what would be a counterclockwise circumnavigation of the island. Ishigaki is shaped roughly like a banjo — or more fittingly, its Okinawan cousin, the sanshin — with a rounded body and slim, necklike peninsula stretching northward. After driving for an hour, we arrived at a small lighthouse at Hirakubozaki, the northernmost tip of the island. From the peaceful promontory, with wind whipping through my hair, I watched a solitary paraglider sail above the electric blue water that extended to the horizon. Our next stop was the summit of Nosoko Maapee, a small mountain crowned with distinctive boulders. Pointing out the rocks, Haruna recounted a local legend involving a heartbroken girl who climbed the mountain and turned to stone. We drove partway up the mountain and then continued the ascent on foot, scrambling through thick underbrush and pulling ourselves up the steepest segments with ropes strung between the trees. The reward for our exertion was a stupendous panorama: swaths of pristine forests, long strips of white sand along the coasts, modest mountains in the distance, and in every direction, the shallow turquoise waters deepening into bright cobalt blue. As we lingered at the peak, snacking on onigiri and savoring the view, a lone hiker from Kobe named Masako appeared, and suddenly our merry band of four grew to five. Masako said that she vacations in the Yaeyama Islands annually, having visited nearly 20 times over the years. When I asked why she kept returning, she smiled broadly and replied, “the weather, the food and the people.” On all counts, I understood. The sunny weather that day was ideal, Haruna and the rest of the gang from Cafe Taniwha were proof of the amiable people, and the food I’d eaten had also been fantastic. At a noodle shop called Yaeyama Style, I’d already slurped several bowls of Yaeyama mazesoba, a creamy ramenlike dish with chunks of pork and chewy wheat noodles that were nothing like the buckwheat soba found in other parts of Japan. There had been a delicious green curry soba at Amuritanoniwa, a funky cafe where we also sipped Ishigakijima craft beer produced on the island. In the town’s covered arcade, Yugurena Mall, we had devoured cakelike Okinawan doughnuts and multiple scoops of curiously light-green ice cream subtly flavored with Ishigaki salt. And at Misushi, a sushi restaurant recommended to us at the Cafe Taniwha party, we feasted on fresh seafood as well as luscious nigiri made with lightly seared Ishigaki beef, a local specialty. But it wasn’t until the next stop on our road trip that I fully comprehended why people referred to Ishigaki’s natural beauty with such awe. Kabira Bay is home to the island’s most famous beach, a place that could easily be mistaken for Thailand or the Caribbean, with its sugary white sand, aquamarine water and rocky cliffs from which visitors first glimpse the snapshot-worthy shore below. Although swimming there is not permitted — black pearls are cultivated in the bay — rickety glass-bottom boats take tourists on short (yet fascinating) excursions to spy the neon fish, giant clams and lively underwater universe that thrives in the coral reefs just yards offshore. Fortunately, those looking to get wet have no shortage of other beaches to choose from. Near Kabira, snorkelers can explore the coral off Yonehara beach, while families enjoy the shallow waters and soft sand at Sukuji beach. On the west coast, surfers ride the waves off Uganzaki. And every local has a favorite hidden cove or nameless stretch of sand, like Haruna’s secret beach, to which we headed next. A few minutes from her hidden cove was the Uganzaki lighthouse on the island’s gorgeous western cape, where the dramatic setting — tall cliffs plummeting into azure waters, lush green coastline broken only by small coves of sand — felt like the edge of the world. Then we made one final stop before returning to town: Mirumiru, a hilltop ice cream shop where the exotic flavors — purple yam and dragon fruit — were as impressive as the views from atop the grassy knoll that sloped toward the sea. After that eventful day trip, there was an easy rhythm to our remaining time on Ishigaki. We spent days lazing on beaches and nights at hole-in-the-wall reggae bars with local surfers and Tokyoites a tad too fond of awamori, the Okinawan distilled spirit. On our final day, we borrowed comically small bicycles and rode about four miles out of town to Fusaki beach, where we had the entire expanse to ourselves all afternoon. When the sun eventually began to set, we slowly pedaled back along the sea wall, watching the last rays of light illuminate what now felt like our own secret slice of paradise.
