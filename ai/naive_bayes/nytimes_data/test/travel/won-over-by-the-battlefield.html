Won Over by the Battlefield
A son’s fascination with historic battles sets the itinerary for family vacations that stretch from Normandy to Pearl Harbor.
===
It was a sunny day when we arrived at the Pearl Harbor Visitor Center, the Navy ships a dreary gray against the stunning turquoise water. In the distance I could see the white, bridge-like Arizona Memorial. I have to admit I was a little excited. I was with my 14-year-old son, Dean, reading the panels on the outdoor exhibits, waiting for our ferry to the memorial, when I noticed our fellow tourists: two teenage girls laughing and taking a selfie in front of an antique torpedo. Right next to them was a happy family, smiling widely in front of a standing missile. Seeing tourists have a fabulous time while taking photographs in front of a giant weapon — something I’ve witnessed more times in my life than I would have ever predicted — always put me in a bad mood. I felt the blood surge to my face. But before I could even throw a dirty look their way, Dean gave me a knowing shrug and calmly pulled me on to the next exhibit. Years ago, when I dreamed of going to Hawaii, I imagined sipping a drink from a pineapple on a secluded beach, not standing in an outdoor military museum, irritated at the people around me. But visiting such places was now my duty. Battlefields have become a strange, but expected, part of my travels with my family. With each trip, each one farther from home, we have visited a battleground. Ticonderoga. Culloden. Normandy. And now Pearl Harbor. At best, military history had always bored me. History had been my least favorite subject, and the study of wars my least favorite part of history. I had been a hippie in high school, listening to Neil Young and drawing peace signs on my notebooks. As a young adult, I had never been comfortable with the line between honoring our fallen soldiers and the glorification of war, so I had avoided the subject altogether. But Dean became fascinated by battles when he was a little boy; alone in his room, he would act them out, down to the smallest detail, which he researched in history books. (Even the weather outside his window had to match the weather on the actual day of battle.) I encouraged his love of history, as any decent mother would, and pretended to be fascinated by flanking assaults. But then, to my amazement, Dean’s obsession began to rub off on me. Ever so slowly. Our first military road trip was to Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, while Dean was studying the Revolutionary War. In the winter, naturally. His younger sister, Paulina, and I were less than thrilled. But Dean was doing a project for his fourth grade class on the life of a soldier at Valley Forge, so my husband and I thought some hands-on research would help. Amid the patches of snow, we came upon a few log huts, just like the ones the soldiers would have built that December in 1777. Inside one were a few re-enactors, hunkered down by the fireplace, in their tricorn hats, red, white and blue uniforms and fingerless gloves. Period re-enactments always seemed silly to me, but I went along with Dean and took some photos of him, in his parka and Polartec hat, next to the “soldiers.” Dean’s military focus soon shifted to the Civil War. On a family drive to Gettysburg, a few miles from my mother-in-law’s house, I felt that some visitors waved the Confederate flag a bit too enthusiastically and grinned a little too widely for photos in the place where 8,000 men had perished. I considered sitting in the car, but frowningly went along as Dean walked us up and around the boulders and through the various stages of the Battle of Little Round Top. The next year, we visited Charleston. Between meals of shrimp and grits and walks beneath trees dripping with Spanish moss, we took a detour to Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired. At the last minute, put off by all the enthusiasm over Confederate artillery, I decided not to board the ferry with Dean and my husband, Wendell, and instead visited the Charleston Museum with Paulina where we watched a live owl demonstration. I preferred owl pellets to bullets. Wendell took Dean solo to Fort Ticonderoga in upstate New York, where the sound of battle rang out a hundred years before Sumter, during a pivotal moment in the French and Indian War. He and Dean loved it so much that they insisted Paulina and I go back with them for the next re-enactment. After some badgering, I surrendered. Paulina and I were impressed not by the legions of re-enactors shooting muskets at one another, but by the majestic beauty of the place — the Norwegian maple-lined road leading up to the 18th-century stone fort and the yawning, sweeping view of Lake Champlain. As I was enjoying the scenery, Dean excitedly explained how that big, beautiful space was once filled with British supply ships and how the two sides fought again and again over this strategic spot. I turned my face to the sun and tried to think more peaceful thoughts. But I was intrigued. Dean’s history lessons really started to penetrate my defenses when we visited Ireland the next spring. He wanted to drive a half-hour out of our way through County Galway, through several traffic circles, to visit the site of the Battle of Aughrim. I didn’t push back: I even helped find it on the map. When we got there, it was raining and muddy, so we didn’t get out but drove around the perimeter of the big, desolate field. There didn’t seem to be much in the way of signs or a visitors’ center, but Dean didn’t need them. By this time, Dean had become a virtual military expert about this and — it seemed to me — almost every battle ever written about in the Osprey Guides and beyond. (His reference materials soon spilled over onto four shelves.) On this field in 1691, he said, 7,000 soldiers had died in the turning point of the Williamite War, in one of the bloodiest battles in Irish history, basically putting an end to the first Jacobite rebellion. I had no idea what he was talking about, or who the Jacobites were, but could see out of the car window that this was as grim a spot as any we had visited on Dean’s battlefield excursions. An intense sadness rose from the landscape, and with it a chill so strong I couldn’t wait to get back to the warmth of our inn. Once there, I got as close as I could to the peat fire and opened my book to where I had left off. I was rereading James Joyce’s “Dubliners” and was finally at the end, “The Dead,” one of my favorite stories. About three-quarters in, I reached the part where Gretta is at the top of the stairs, plaintively listening to the young tenor sing the song that will trigger the memory of her lost love and the haunting climax of the story. O, the rain falls on my heavy locks  And the dew wets my skin,  My babe lies cold… Gretta recognizes the song. It’s called “The Lass of Aughrim.” That cold, sad battlefield we had just left. The chills crawled up my arms and spine, and from that day on, I never took any of Dean’s history lessons for granted. The Ireland trip was expensive, but thrilling. So we decided to take at least one ambitious journey with our children each year, using cash from our home equity account. We knew we were entering a perfect but brief period when they were old enough to travel easily but young enough to still want to spend time with us. Next trip: Scotland. Now I was fully engaged. I helped chart our road trip to Culloden, to see the battleground from the last Jacobite rebellion in 1746, and the newly built interpretive center. The vast moor was grassy and unadorned except for a stone cairn and some gravestones here and there marking the clans who fought and died there. We walked on the snaking pathways on the nearly empty field and tried to imagine the 15,000 soldiers who took part in the last hand-to-hand battle on British soil. Inside, I slowly moved through the displays, which explained that although the battle was bloody, it lasted only an hour. I even chatted with the re-enactors, who held and described the swords, muskets, axes and decorated rounded shields used in battle. I soaked in all I could about the warring Scottish Highland clans and their relationship with England, which gave life to those lonely, slumbering mountains we were driving through each day and even gave me some understanding of the mournful nature of bagpipes. The following spring in France, I gladly took the drive from Paris to Normandy. I glanced over the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc, down which the Army Rangers had rappelled, climbed into the deep pits left by the shells, and marveled at that gaping, wide beach those young World War II soldiers had landed upon in June 1944, which seemed, in comparison to the other sites we had visited, not so long ago. The beaches were deserted, except for a few tourists like us, and though sunny and bordered by quaint country houses, had a desolate, haunted quality. Then last summer, on a trip to Yellowstone, I didn’t expect to come across anything but nature and wildlife. But along the towering peaks on the Chief Joseph Scenic Byway, Dean explained just who Chief Joseph was, and how he and his band of 750 passed through here in 1877, along what’s now known as the Nez Perce Trail. Refusing to settle on a reservation, Chief Joseph tried to lead his tribe into Canada, but was relentlessly pursued by the United States Army. We stopped the car and got out and looked at the rising, snow-capped Absaroka Range, its peaks natural monuments to the Nez Perce, many of whom froze to death or were killed in battle. These mountains looked different from what they’d been just a minute earlier, before Dean had filled us in on what had transpired in the shadow of their beauty. It dawned on me on that mountaintop that the battlefields added not just a darkness but a weight and a depth of meaning to each of our vacations that I never would have discovered on my own. They’ve given me a sense of who the people who lived and died in these places actually were and are even today, what they cared about, what they cared enough about to die for. I was used to visiting places and chewing up only the scenery and the local delicacies. But history — and its connection to the living culture — was all around us, under our feet, part of the landscape. It was just a matter of opening my eyes and allowing Dean to teach me, instead of my teaching him. Our next trip, in the spring, will cover Amsterdam, Bruges — and Waterloo. Dean no longer stages his own re-enactments in his room. He outgrew that long ago. But he’s become an expert in geography, a member of the model U.N. at school, and is fascinated by what happens around the world. I credit the battles. At Pearl Harbor, I was more engaged than ever. With Dean at my side, I read all the displays, not only about the attack, but also about the Japanese internment camps and life during wartime. At the time of the bombing, one-third of the islands’ residents, I learned, were Japanese citizens. In fact, many of the tourists there were Japanese, I was surprised to find. When a helicopter carrier made its way into the harbor, I realized this place was still a working naval base. But I learned so much more than that, including a lesson I hadn’t expected to hear at a war memorial. We took the ferry and were standing over the rusted wreckage of the Arizona, oil still leaking from its hull and leaving tiny rainbows on the water’s surface. To my embarrassment, I fought back tears. Below us, my audio tour explained, were the remains of hundreds of sailors, many of them not much older than Dean. The voice on my headset, one of the veteran survivors, said that the dead below us shouldn’t make us sad. “They would like you to remember them and to love them,” he said. “And by all means, to love one another.” Even those tourists taking photos with torpedoes.
