The Art of the ‘Vacationship’
Kristin Newman, a comedy writer, talks about finding romance while on vacation.

“I love to do the thing you’re supposed to do in the place you’re supposed to do it.” So explained Kristin Newman, a comedy writer who has spent many a hiatus abroad, about why she’s smoked in Parisian cafes — though she doesn’t smoke — and has been whacked with eucalyptus in Muscovite banyas. And why she’s fallen in love in faraway countries. “A romance with a local is the gold medal of ‘the thing you’re supposed to do’ Olympics,” she said. “It always makes me feel like I really have infiltrated a place.” Her new book, “ “You can fall madly in love, tell each other you love each other immediately, because there are no repercussions,” she said. “Everyone knows it’s going to end in just a few days.” Recently Ms. Newman talked about how to meet people on the road. Following are edited excerpts from the conversation. Q. What are your tips for meeting people when you’re traveling alone? A.  Go to places like Argentina or Chile or New Zealand, where you can join a group of people doing something adventurous. You’re alone, but not alone. You’re on a boat with a cute guy in the Great Barrier Reef who’s also traveling alone. Sign up for some activity or day tour where you know you’ll meet other people and then ask them out to dinner. That’s my trick. Any other tips? I have used Facebook to say, “I’m going to this city, who knows someone there?” Always somebody knows somebody. Be brave and pick up the phone and say: “I’m coming to town. I’d love to buy you dinner.” That’s safer than going to a bar alone. Don’t stay in high-end hotels. It’s all rich married couples, and the low range is all college backpackers. If you want to find people in their mid-20s to late 30s, you want the middle range, a funky boutique hotel or hostel. Hostels have a bad rap as places where you sleep with 16 people in a bunk, but I’ve stayed in some beautiful ones. At one in Ushuaia in Argentina, I had my own room, a private bathroom, but there was a communal lounge area where I immediately met 10 people. What have you gleaned of other countries’ dating rituals? French people don’t go on dates. If you have a connection, you get very romantic, very fast, and if you go out with someone else the next night, then you betrayed that person and your story is over. In Israel, they ask you if you’d like to be their lover, and you say yes or no. Americans won’t ask for your number until 1:45 in the morning, when they’ve worked up enough liquid courage. If they’re at one end of the sexual aggressiveness continuum, and Italians at the other, Argentines are in middle. They come up to you and say, “Hello, you’re beautiful.” You say, “No thank you,” and they go to the girl next to you. They know it’s their job to throw it out there, but don’t take it personally when you say no.
