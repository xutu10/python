In Scotland, Guts, Glory and Haggis
A hands-on lesson in the Highlands involves tearing up organs and stuffing sheep’s stomachs, with tasty results.
===
Just before 5 in the morning, the slender streets of little Dingwall, a town in the heart of the Scottish Highlands, were completely silent. No cars waited at the handful of stoplights downtown; even the bakers hadn’t stirred. In the cool, still grayness, I tiptoed through the streets, marveling at the squat green hills that frame the town, feeling slightly disoriented, though I knew it must be impossible to get lost in such a snug place. I rounded a bend and came upon what had drawn me to this sleepy town: George Cockburn & Son, champions of  Ah, haggis. Before I’d gone to Scotland this year, I wondered what exactly made the dish — sheep’s innards packed into sheep’s stomach — qualify as a delicacy. But as an adventurous cook and eater, I pride myself in trying everything at least once, so I eagerly spooned a first taste of it into my mouth at a castle in Edinburgh. It was a revelation — intensely rich and meaty, with the earthy flavor of what my mother calls “spare parts” combined with the comforting muskiness of oatmeal. It instantly won me over. During my five-week stay in Scotland, I would seek it out wherever I went — trying it both in its traditional form, as “haggis, neeps and tatties” (haggis, parsnips and potatoes), but also tucked within dumplings and presented in other modern forms on menus. (Sadly, I was unable to find a bar snack of haggis nachos a friend had told me about.) In one of Edinburgh’s best traditional Scottish restaurants, though, I noticed that Cockburn’s haggis was often on offer. The butchery may be tiny but it ships to restaurants and grocers all over Britain. Then I heard that Cockburn was the first champion haggis maker in the country. I knew I had to visit. Curious, I dialed the owner with an unusual request: Could I come and help you make haggis? Though the company doesn’t offer haggis-making tours to the public, my experience is instructive because there are plenty of places to learn. (See below.) However, getting to those may not offer the idyllic train trip I took through Northern Scotland, past Inverness and the scenic Moray Firth, to Dingwall.­ Like many small towns in Scotland, Dingwall has a train station, a hotel, a few Chinese takeouts, more than a few pubs and a local business that gives the place name recognition, in this case, Cockburn haggis. The morning I navigated its empty streets, I arrived at the small shop at just the right time — the meat truck had pulled up, and Fraser MacGregor, a clean-cut, muscular man in a sharp blue-and-white pinstriped doctor’s-style coat, blue dress shirt, neatly knotted tie and sleek white fedora, was hard at work hoisting boxes of suet and lamb, each weighing many kilograms, into his spacious, pristine kitchen. Mr. MacGregor, 46, hadn’t been at the 1976 haggis competition himself, but he’s been working at Cockburn since he was 16, eventually buying it from Jocky McCallum, the owner who came up with the winning haggis recipe. Haggis, Scotland’s national dish, has been made and consumed in the country for centuries — long before the poet Robert Burns wrote an ode to it 1787. It’s the ultimate peasant food — a dish that involved stuffing lungs and livers into a stomach casing ensured that no part of the animal went to waste. It has become such a source of national identity that in addition to the meat traders’ competition for haggis making, there are others for eating and hurling the food. A haggis fan himself, having had it for dinner two to three times a week since he was a “bairn,” Mr. MacGregor prides himself in keeping the tradition alive. And so, even though he’s the boss now, Mr. MacGregor says he makes the shop’s haggis every week. “Normally you start at the bottom and work your way up to the top,” he said. “But no, I’m still doing the same job I was when I was 16.” The prized haggis recipe was handed over with the store, and the version made today is the one that won. Cockburn haggis is in such demand that Mr. MacGregor spends two mornings each week making a total of about 1,100 pounds for clients all over Britain and beyond, to countries including Hungary and Germany. In January, when Britain lights up with Burns suppers celebrating the work of Robert Burns, Cockburn is inundated with orders, as haggis is the star of all these suppers. That month, Mr. MacGregor makes haggis seven days a week, churning out about 15 tons by the end. I was grateful not to be visiting in January but still, I quickly realized I wasn’t quite prepared for the task at hand. After handing me a white coat and fedora Mr. MacGregor handed me, he asked if I needed anything, a cup of tea perhaps, and then we set to work. The process had begun the night before, with Mr. MacGregor boiling 220 pounds of lamb lungs and livers, which he now started fishing out of a giant silver vat with a large netted scoop. Soon, he had built up a huge mound of steaming chocolate-brown meat parts on a big trough. Mr. MacGregor waved me over and showed me the drill: Grab a lamb lung or heart, rip it apart with your fingers and pull out the rubbery veins and tubes inside and discard those. I tried to hide my shock — Lamb lungs? Hearts? Tubey rubbery bits? With great concentration — and “Eye of the Tiger” playing on the radio — Mr. MacGregor quickly set to work. I followed his lead. I grabbed the first brown piece I could find. I tried not to wince as I felt its texture: warm, slippery, squidgy. I could not tell lung from heart at that point. Having been boiled to softness, it easily came apart as my fingers tore through, giving way to meat that was slightly rubbery yet also mealy in texture. Locating the veins and tubes was easy — extricating them a little more trying. I felt as though I was trying to pull elastic bands out from a rock. Soon, I realized I had to sink my nails in and get down and dirty — deeply clawing my way into each heart to grab enough of the tubing to give it a firm yank. By a rough count, we had a few hundred lamb pieces in front of us. Squeamishness was going to get me nowhere. Gradually, Mr. MacGregor and I settled into a quiet rhythm, picking up lung after heart after lung, until there were none left to de-vein. Once we had a nice mound of heart and lung bits, Mr. MacGregor mixed these in a trough with liquid left over from boiling the lamb parts, meal, dried onions and a variety of spices — the secret recipe. Then he ran the mixture through a giant processor, twice, amassing several troughs of light brown pulp. Now this was starting to look more like the haggis I’d eaten in Edinburgh. When I’d first arrived in Scotland and inquired about haggis, a local friend, finding my enthusiasm for the stuff amusing, had said, “Do you like porridge? It’s like a meat porridge.” And it’s true — while haggis at its inception was stuffed into sheep’s stomachs and boiled, the versions you’ll find in Scottish homes and restaurants these days tend to be a mealy mess of meat, spices, oats and onions all mixed together. Mr. MacGregor now had a big, brown porridge-like pile before him, which he fed into a machine that funneled haggis into plastic tubing of various sizes — one-, two- and several-pound versions. But there was a special casing for high-end proprietors. For a fancy hotel that had ordered a traditional haggis, he disappeared into his fridge for a moment, emerging with what looked like a sickly yellowish white plastic bag. “Feel it,” he said, smiling. “This is a sheep’s stomach.” My nose wasn’t anywhere near his hands but I could already smell it — a rubbery fetid stench, something like melted rubber combined with rotting meat. And when I pressed my fingers on the stomach, it felt rubbery and wrinkly. As the haggis meal filled it, puffing it up, the stench of the stomach grew even stronger. When Mr. MacGregor saw me grimacing, he confessed that it wasn’t his favorite way of having haggis. “I always eat it packed in tubes.” After that, the bulk of our job was done — Mr. MacGregor and I loaded the haggis tubes into the boiler and 30 minutes later, we were hauling out our dark-chocolate-brown bounty. Since some of them had split open during boiling, Mr. MacGregor nudged me to dig in. I pinched a bit with my fingers and popped it into my mouth. On my way to Dingwall, as my train had raced past verdant country tableaus and breathtaking waterways, I wondered if the ride itself would be the highlight of my trip. Standing in that kitchen, lamb bits between my nails and a mouth filled with freshly made haggis, however, I realized that the ride paled in comparison. This had made the trek worth it. I was so taken with the flavor, I instinctively closed my eyes to hold that feeling a little more.
