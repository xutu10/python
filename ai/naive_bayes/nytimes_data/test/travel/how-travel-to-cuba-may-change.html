President Obama’s order on Wednesday to restore diplomatic relations with  Q. What impact will Wednesday’s announcement have on the number of Americans wanting to travel to Cuba?  A. Mr. Loucks said he anticipates demand for these exchanges to continue to increase, especially after Wednesday’s announcement. “We are already feeling a great deal of demand from clients wanting to go to Cuba, because it has been off limits for over 50 years,” he said. “We now expect the number of bookings to Cuba to grow exponentially.” Q. Does this mean travel agencies will start organizing more trips to Cuba? A. “I think it’s a destination like no other,” said Katharine Bonner, vice president for river and small ship cruising at Tauck, who has taken five trips to Cuba in the last three years. Joe Diaz, co-founder of the travel and publishing company  Q. Will getting a passport/visa become easier? A. This New York Times information graphic  President Obama’s order will open up general licenses to travel for the following reasons, which previously required approval on a case-by-case basis: Public performances, workshops and athletic competitions. Support for the Cuban people, including human rights work. Humanitarian work. Private foundations and institutes. Information dissemination. Travel related to export of authorized products. But lifting all restrictions on travel, including for tourism, would require congressional approval. Q. Will United States airlines start flying commercially to Cuba? A. Q. What is the hotel room/accommodation situation in Cuba now? A. But if Cuba opens up to American tourists and their penchant for luxury accommodations, “you’re going to see American hoteliers doing their best to find potential properties in Cuba,” Mr. Loucks said. “There are some standout properties there in Havana and some of the beach communities.” Q. What will be the impact of travelers being able to use United States debit and credit cards in Cuba? A The United States trade embargo is still in place, and will be until Congress says otherwise, but as a result of the administration’s policy shift, “licensed U.S. travelers to Cuba will be authorized to import $400 worth of goods from Cuba, of which no more than $100 can consist of tobacco products and alcohol combined,” the White House said. That’s good news for Cuban cigar and rum aficionados returning to the United States. Q. What are other changes American visitors to Cuba can expect? A. “Having a U.S. Embassy in a destination puts everyone’s mind at ease,” Ms. Bonner said. Getting connected to the Internet is another change that could be coming for visitors to the island. “Some hotels in Cuba don’t have Internet at all,” Ms. Bonner said. According to the White House, “Cuba has an Internet penetration of about 5 percent — one of the lowest rates in the world.” Changes by the administration could help Cuba strengthen its technological infrastructure. Ms. Bonner, though, said she is taking a wait-and-see approach with this and the other measures outlined on Wednesday. “Nothing’s going to change because someone sent out a press release,” she said.
