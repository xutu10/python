In Cleveland, Adding Life Where Grit Once Prevailed
The Gordon Square stretch of the old Detroit-Shoreway industrial area has been revitalized with galleries, bistros and residents.

About two miles west of downtown Cleveland, the gritty Detroit-Shoreway was once a vibrant neighborhood before it was hit hard by the exodus of big manufacturing companies in the early decades of the 20th century. Lately, new businesses, arts groups and residents have settled in the Gordon Square Arts District, a revitalized mile-long stretch of Detroit Avenue. A recent $30 million capital campaign included new streetscapes and signage. Visitors can catch a show at the Cleveland Public Theater, walk through galleries at 78th Street Studios or grab a late-night bite at XYZ Tavern. And this spring, the Near West Theater will have a $7.3 million new home.

At night, it becomes a place for concerts, lectures, debates, literary events and the occasional polka happy hour. 5801 Detroit Avenue; 216-651-9474;  Capitol Theatre Built in 1921, this former vaudeville and silent-movie theater spent some two decades in disrepair until it reopened, renovated in 2009.
