A Guide to Tokyo, From an Outsider (and Insider)  
The author, who once lived in Tokyo, shares some of her favorite spots, as well as her struggles with alienation in the city.

By 3 a.m., I was dancing to “Material Girl” with a Japanese man in a plaid vest. We were on the crowded dance floor of a disco on the second floor of a nondescript office building tucked at the end of a little alley in Shinjuku Ni-chome,  Using my broken Japanese, I learned that my dance partner was a salaryman by day, slaving away at one of those soul-sucking Japanese office jobs. But this night, he was singing along to Madonna at the New Sazae bar, vamping it up as if we were in an episode of “Club MTV.” He wasn’t the only one pretending. On most nights at home in New York, my husband, Robert, and I are in bed by 10:30 p.m. The only dancing I do takes place clumsily in an overpriced indoor cycling class. Living it up means a second glass of wine at dinner. But here, in the wee hours, Robert stood in a corner, smoking. (He is not a smoker.) He and Ken Nishikawa, a D.J. friend who speaks English with a British accent and some­times goes by the stage name Intelligent Milli Vanilli (which is a phonetic challenge for the Japanese), were engaged in a deep conversation about the Pet Shop Boys. Ken’s wife, Ayumi, drunk on sake, practiced her aikido moves on a woman (I think) in frosted lipstick and teased hair. This is who we are in Tokyo, where it seems nothing is as it should be back home, even if we want it to be. My trip all seems like a dream now, but then so does my old life, when I lived there as a foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal and Robert and I were dating long distance. Neither of us had been to Japan since I moved back to the United States in late 2007. My plan was to revisit all of my favorite places, starting with recreating my very first night in Tokyo nearly a decade ago, when Ken, a friend of a friend who was eager to show a gaijin (foreigner) around, first took me through a portal to a world that I never would have discovered on my own. He helped me unearth what felt like the real Tokyo of side streets and back ways, like Nonbei Yokocho (Drunkard’s Alley), a quiet passageway lit up with red Japanese lanterns just across from the chaos of Shibuya Station. You could wander to the end, ascend a tiny set of stairs to Shutendo, a haven of Japanese whiskey and jazz that seats only seven people and vibrates when the J.R. Yamanote train runs overhead. I would have flown 14 hours just to have a shochu on ice there. Then go to the nearby Shibuya Creston Hotel, take the elevator one level down to the bland lobby and enter the cavernous Shabuzen, a smoky shabu shabu paradise of all-you-can-eat Japanese beef with waitresses in full kimono and ikebana arrangements. Ever since I left Tokyo, I’d been providing friends, colleagues, and anyone else passing through, with directions to these establishments and others on a list of my favorite spots, most of which I had I picked up from Ken and my other Japanese friends. I wanted this itinerary to be the next best thing to having a Japanese friend, an entree into Tokyo beyond the incense-scented shrines, five-star hotel hospitality and raucous Roppongi district (which I avoided like the plague). The list feels so vital because not only do very few Japanese speak English, but Tokyo also has a maze of unnamed streets and cultural barriers. This is a city where foreigners who want to get into a place unaccustomed to them can expect proprietors to cross their arms or fingers to flash an “X” or batsu symbol, which means “wrong” or “no good,” or, as I like to think of it, “That ain’t happening.” (Robert and I may have broken some kind of gaijin record on our latest trip when an employee at a 24-hour McDonald’s gave us the “X.”) Tokyo seems as if it were designed to keep the world at bay, its best self a secret neon-strewn walled garden that can provide both some of the most otherworldly and alienating experiences. The list I created couldn’t get you past the “X” gesture but it had become so widely circulated that as we were planning our first trip back in seven years, an acquaintance told me we  After Robert and I arrived at the Park Hyatt Hotel from Narita Airport, we quickly refueled on a bento box at the 7-Eleven. (In Japan, even the packaged convenience store food is delicious.) Hoping to take advantage of our jet lag, we skipped a nap and met Ken and Ayumi in the hotel’s glass-enclosed lobby, the setting of Bill Murray’s and Scarlett Johansson’s late-night longing in “Lost in Translation.” We followed them as they pushed their tiny collapsible bicycles through the streets of Shinjuku to the Albatross G, a compact three-story saloon with blood-red walls, and one of hundreds of tiny bars squeezed into Golden Gai, a hodgepodge of alleyways, some only wide enough for a single person. Many of these shanty-style bars were used as brothels until the late 1950s, when prostitution was banned. Ken had explained all this to me when we went to Golden Gai on my first disorienting night in Japan. He also told me that his mother is a geisha, which I had assumed was a joke played on the naïve foreigner. “Yeah, right, and your dad is a samurai,” I responded. But his mother really is a geisha, I later learned. We once went to watch her perform a fan dance in full kimono in the resort town of Atami, where John Wayne is said to have relaxed while filming the 1958 movie “The Barbarian and the Geisha.” We continued our night with Ken not far from the Albatross G at Omoide Yokocho (which, depending on whom you ask, is known in English as Memory Lane or Piss Alley), an alley lined with closet-size yakitori restaurants. I ordered a Hoppy, a beer-flavored drink popular with Japan’s working class that makes for the perfect complement to the pork belly and chicken ball skewers. I love to shop, but I gave it up in Japan after a saleswoman at the Shibuya 109 department store, a cylindrical silver tower that caters to tan teenage girls in knee-high hose, politely handed me pants in a size XXL. They wouldn’t button. (I am a size 6 in the United States.) From then on, the money I saved on clothes I spent at Kyubey, a delicate Edo-style sushi bar where the omakase, or set course for two, costs around $500. I was led there by my foodie friend Yukari Iwatani Kane, a journalist and author who picked up where Ken left off, introducing me to Tokyo’s most delectable restaurants. We took in a meal at the original Ginza location that forever altered my perception of what raw fish can taste like. Most Americans head to Sukiyabashi Jiro, the Michelin-starred sushi bar in the Ginza Metro station that was featured in the 2011 documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi.” But the service can be brusque, which is at odds with the art of the sushi chef and the friendly, but respectful, rapport he develops with customers. On our trip back, Robert and I headed to Kyubey and sat right in front of Taira-san, the warm and charismatic head chef there. He speaks no English but managed to offer us pointers. (Don’t overdo it with the soy sauce. Always hold a piece of sushi sideways with chopsticks.) Taira-san’s attentiveness can result in a crash course in culinary cultural immersion: When I lived there, he surprised us with horse meat on my birthday. (Personally, I highly recommend it, but Robert, just to be safe, carries a card in his wallet that reads “I do not eat raw horse meat” in Japanese.) During my nostalgic bar hop with Ken and meal of lightly battered sea urchin tempura with Yukari, I had blocked out the downside to the hidden Tokyo. Much of the time I lived in Japan, I suffered from a brutal crush of loneliness and isolation. The more Japanese I learned and the more I tried to gain access to a world tucked away from outsiders, the more excluded and different I felt. The memory of that suffocating lonesomeness hit me one afternoon at the Spa LaQua in Tokyo Dome City. The spa, built under a roller coaster that passes overhead every few minutes (relaxing in Tokyo has its limits), offers outdoor and indoor onsens (hot baths), earwax cleaning and a chilly room where spagoers can watch languid  I was feeling pretty stress-free after watching the jellyfish and splurging on a $200 body scrub. But in my excitement to revisit a Japanese spa, I had forgotten to cover the tiny tattoo on my ankle with a Band-Aid. Japanese bathhouses often have a no tattoo rule, intended to keep out yakuza, the tattoo-covered members of organized crime groups in Japan, but the rule also serves the nifty purposes of keeping out clueless foreigners like me. It’s worth explaining that my tattoo is the size of a nickel. My father hates it, but not nearly as much as the Japanese do. I was nude and stepping into the onsen when two stern Spa LaQua employees in matching pink skirt suits arrived to escort me out of the facility. They watched over me as I put my clothes on as quickly as I could. They shook their heads in disapproval. I offered my deepest apologies in Japanese, but it didn’t matter. They told me sternly that my husband would have to leave, too, if he had a tattoo. (He doesn’t.) I felt defeated. I had tried so hard to learn some Japanese and embrace the culture, but I still felt, at best, like an outsider. It seemed impossible for me to avoid being what is perhaps the worst thing in Japanese culture: I was a rule breaker. As we left the spa I had a mild panic attack and pleaded with Robert to call United and get us on the next flight out of Tokyo. “They hate us,” I said. “They don’t want us here.” He suggested we discuss it over dinner. One bite of Taira-san’s unagi with sea salt and we decided to give Tokyo a few more days.
