In Detroit, Revitalizing Taste by Taste
Considered a food desert not so long ago, Detroit is now a culinary oasis. Here’s a look at four of the city’s new restaurants.

­Keeping up with the dining scene in Detroit these days is a full-time job. It seems that every time I return from my travels, a flurry of emails from foodie friends informs me of yet another restaurant or distillery that has opened, or gastronomic “event” I have missed, like a “Book & Bread” dinner at the letterpress studio, Salt & Cedar, where diners enjoy a feast of locally grown ingredients before hand-sewing a journal. Considered a food desert not so long ago, Detroit is now a culinary oasis. In the last year alone, nearly a dozen new restaurants have opened, from Grille Midtown serving everything from jambalaya to rib-eyes in a renovated century-old former theater on Woodward Avenue, to Craft Work, which serves seasonal cuisine in the historic district of West Village. And while the city has long been known for its great diversity of ethnic food and chili dogs, it is finally getting a reputation that reaches beyond ribs. What is abundantly clear is that some of the most enterprising restaurateurs in Detroit are those burrowing into empty buildings and taking advantage of start-up funds from regional and citywide competitions, as well as from eager investors. “I think those of us in the food scene here really have the chance to help shape the city’s future identity,” said Craig Lieckfelt, a sixth-generation Detroiter and the creator and chef behind Guns & Butter, a global pop-up extravaganza that Anthony Bourdain raved about after experiencing one of his meals here in Detroit. “It is a responsibility that is rare for a chef,” Mr. Lieckfelt said, adding that he is now working on the opening of a permanent Detroit restaurant. “Consumers here are hungry for good food, which we have plenty of in Michigan. You can tell because all the new restaurants are packed.” The 30-year-old worked in Manhattan at the three-Michelin-star restaurant Jean Georges before moving back to Michigan in 2013. Here is a brief look at what has been cooking in the last year or so at four new restaurants in Detroit, where the business models seem to be as much about community as commerce. With its bright yellow and red walls, plate-glass windows and fluttering World Cup country flags, La Feria brings a taste of Spain to Detroit. While the southwest neighborhood boasts a number of authentic Mexican restaurants, a spot serving true tapas was still missing until Pilar Baron-Hidalgo, a Seville native, her friend, Naomi Khalil, and Ms. Khalil’s brother, Elias Khalil, opened one last October. Filling the void was a natural extension for this group, who for more than a decade had been celebrating La Feria de Abril, a traditional Sevillian festival of food and flamenco dancing at their homes. But it was Hatch Detroit, a start-up business competition with a $50,000 prize the friends won that made their yearly ritual a bricks-and-mortar reality. Finding the midtown restaurant on Cass Avenue (once one of the most dangerous streets in Detroit and now one of the best areas for shopping) is easy, thanks to the crowd of patrons seen through the often-open windows swilling sangria. After entering the one-room restaurant with its worn wooden tables and a bar stocked with Spanish wines, my dining companion and I sat down and immediately started ordering. In quick succession a variety of steaming plates appeared, along with a bottle of Rioja. Patatas bravas, quickly fried potatoes drizzled artistically with a spicy tomato salsa and a creamy aioli sauce were wonderfully crisp, and the lightly battered fried eggplant was not too soggy despite a thick glaze of honey. But it was the seared shrimp in garlic that were particularly fresh in their simplicity. “I make the food I learned to make from my mother and grandmother in Spain,” Ms. Baron-Hidalgo explained. “It is what you eat in every bar in Seville.” After sopping up our oily plates with many free refills of bread, we split a Spanish caramel flan, a creamy custard with a toffee-tasting syrup that jiggled on my fork before melting in my mouth, and took note of Ms. Baron-Hidalgo, who emerged after the lunch rush was over to sip an espresso in her white chef’s coat. La Feria, 4130 Cass Avenue;  Entering Wright & Company, the newest and most talked about entrant of the summer, is like walking onto the set of “Mad Men” — once you find it on the second floor of a building with nothing but a street placard bearing a “W” logo to tip you off. The only thing more glamorous than the well-dressed after-work crowd is the décor: red leather banquettes, marble tabletops and a corner turret lit by an enormous crystal chandelier. But it is the sparkling tin ceiling, a new addition to this renovated late-19th-century brick building, not to mention the antlers and moose head poking out from steel walls painted to look like dark wood, that will make you feel as if you are in a private club. That, and the chatty customers sipping specialty cocktails — like the Michigan Avenue (the restaurant’s take on a Manhattan with house-made cherry bitters) — at the long, sleek bar. (One of the two owners, Dave Kwiatkowski, is the mixologist behind Sugar House, a popular Detroit vintage bar.) “You have to try this,” said one man at the bar. He was enjoying an appetizer of dates stuffed with Gorgonzola and topped with bacon and almonds. “It is sweet but smoky,” he said, complimenting the chef, Marc Djozlija, a native Detroiter who has opened a number of restaurants for Wolfgang Puck over the last two decades. Once seated (they take no reservations and the wait can be up to an hour), we promptly asked for the dates, and also ordered pork belly sliders on a brioche bun, embellished with tomato jam and sprigs of arugula, and the Seared Teres Major, a technical name for a tender shoulder cut of steak. Nestled on a mild horseradish purée, and spicy chimichurri sauce, the meat cut like butter and the mix of herbs made each bite pop. I almost felt guilty ordering dessert with so many people waiting for tables, but cast all shame aside when I tasted the almond brittle crumbled over a rich panna cotta with raspberry sauce. “Our goal was to become a great gathering place downtown,” said Mr. Kwiatkowski, noting that the restaurant not only has a great happy hour and dinner service, but also a late-night bar scene. Wright & Company, 1500 Woodward Avenue; Erika Boyd and Kirsten Ussery did not win the Hatch Detroit contest in 2012 (it went to La Feria), but their near success as one of four finalists spurred them on to keep their vegan restaurant business plan alive. As life partners (and business partners), the couple had already adopted a vegan diet after the death of Ms. Boyd’s father from cancer in 2010. Friends and family soon began eating their food as they experimented with recipes entirely plant based. In February 2012 they decided to take their food on the road with a meal delivery and catering business. Their goal, as they state on their website, was to help their community eat better and, in turn, avoid diet-related diseases. Last year, after gaining a retail space through REVOLVE (a Detroit Economic Growth Corporation initiative to pair entrepreneurs, artists and community leaders with vacant spaces), they were finally able to open. A small, brightly lit restaurant promoting itself as 100 percent vegan, it now draws a health-focused crowd of all ages. They gather not only for sandwiches, salads and stir fries, but also for collards, black-eyed peas and corn bread, all nonanimal product offerings. “A lot of people have had bad experiences with tofu and think it has no flavor,” said Ms. Ussery, who is from North Carolina. “We wanted to do flavorful soul food that was healthy,” she said, “food that is not intimidating.” Having never been to a vegan restaurant, I was shocked by how much my BLT made with smoked coconut “bacon” tasted like the real thing (even better), and how my Seitan Pepper Steak with peppers, onion, broccoli, garlic and ginger served over brown rice filled me up as much as a meat dish. And watching the mothers in the restaurant feeding their small children brown-rice-pasta macaroni with soy cheese and a bowl full of Southern-fried tofu bits, I couldn’t help but think the owners were succeeding in their goal — the next generation was gobbling it up, kale and all. Detroit Vegan Soul, 8029 Agnes Street;  Ask a patron about Rose’s Fine Food, which opened in July, and the words, “charming” and “adorable” will likely be uttered. And not just because the two women who renovated this east side vintage diner, Lucy Carnaghi and Molly Mitchell, are 32-year-old first cousins who named the place after their grandmother’s favorite flower. The atmosphere and food feel wonderfully old-fashioned. It is open for breakfast and lunch only. One can’t help but smile upon entering the establishment the cousins fixed up with the help of a $20,000 Kickstarter campaign. The linoleum counters are adorned with cut flowers in glass jars, the antique china cups and saucers are mismatched, and a tempting selection of treats — on one recent Sunday there were frosted cakes made from scratch (coconut and a chocolate-cinnamon), a gingerbread pudding topped with plums and a bowl of sliced peaches. But it is the overhead chalkboard that reveals that day’s “ESD” (egg sandwich of the day), which we quickly requested: a biscuit with fried eggs, pesto, heirloom tomatoes, smoky mozzarella and pickled peppers. Sadly, by 1 p.m., when we ordered, it was sold out — not surprising considering the line bled into the parking lot (they serve coffee outside to those waiting). Fortunately, they were not out of the Up Stream Sandwich, a Great Lakes whitefish dressed with a house aioli and a garlicky cucumber salad. And we managed to grab the last serving of the other special of the day: a wrap filled with baba ghanouj, olives, tomatoes and zucchini. “We wanted it to be the affordable kind of place you could eat a couple of times a day if you wanted,” said Ms. Mitchell, remembering a diner she frequented growing up that had customers who ate there all day long. Most generous, however, is a note on the back of their menu promising a 10 percent discount to all the neighbors who live within a mile of their still-struggling east side community. Rose’s Fine Food; 10551 East Jefferson Avenue;
