Gear for a Snowy Getaway
These skis, boards, boots, gloves and goggles will ease your way on the mountain.

Forget the GoPro and the Bluetooth gloves. This season’s best ski and snowboard gear takes full advantage of technology to simply help improve your experience on the slopes. Ski materials like lightweight carbon, gloves that warm your hands effectively and boards that help ease your ascent are a few examples of the items that take the essentialist approach to skiing and boarding. At right is a fuller look at these and more. Uvex | $499 |  Lately, goggles have gained notice more for their bells and whistles than for helping visibility. Integrated cameras or displays inside the lens that show temperature or vertical feet are pretty exciting, after all. But this goggle returns the emphasis to a clear view of the slopes, albeit in a high-tech way. Drawing from technology developed for fighter pilots, a light-sensitive photocell triggers the liquid-crystal-enhanced lens to change to one of four tints — including clear — in a fraction of a second, based on conditions. That means no more need to swap out other lenses when the weather goes from sunny to snowy, or back again. The tint can also be changed manually by the push of a small button. Outdoor Research | $350 |  Perhaps nothing drives skiers back to the lodge faster than frigid fingers. The newest tool in the cold-fighting kit, these gloves feature a heating element powered by rechargeable batteries that is woven into the fibers of the interior fabric, giving them twice the heated surface area as other similar gloves. That means warmth is directed to the back of the hand as well as the fingers. Three temperature settings controlled by a button on the cuff adjust the amount of heat provided, which will last from two and a half to eight hours, depending on the level. Other protective elements in these waterproof gloves include synthetic insulation and abrasion-resistant goat leather on the palms. A mitt style is available at the same price. Salomon | $1,299 |  Backcountry skiers have got a lot of decent options for their ascent. Backcountry snowboarders, not so much. They can either snowshoe up, carrying their snowboards in a backpack, or use splitboards, which detach to provide two wide, awkwardly shaped skis for skinning uphill. This new splitboard aims to ease the trip uphill by breaking down into four pieces: two lightweight skis that are 90 millimeters at the waist, allowing a more natural uphill stride, and two pieces that stow in a pack. When fully assembled, the 157-centimeter-long snowboard is stable and maneuverable for the ride down. A slightly tapered tail makes starting turns easier and helps the board float in powder. The board is sold in a package that includes bindings, skins and crampons. DPS | $1,299 |  Because it is stiff yet lightweight, carbon is an increasingly popular ski material. This premium all-mountain model comes from the boutique ski maker DPS, which has produced carbon skis for almost a decade. Valued for its versatility in powder and on groomed slopes, the snappy, responsive Wailer 105 has been completely retooled for even better performance, with a new sidecut, a flat tail and moderate rocker in the tip. The ski is made at DPS’s Utah factory, where it is now built with a different laminate from that of years past and spacers in the tips and tails to add power and dampness to the skis. The result: a smoother glide through all kinds of snow. If the price is too steep, opt for the slightly heavier, slightly less expensive, hybrid version ($949), which combines the carbon with traditional fiberglass and bamboo. Tip/waist/tail dimensions (in millimeters): 136/105/119. Lange | $700 |  With a 102-millimeter last (interior), these high-performance boots are a welcome option for advanced skiers with wide feet, who have not been catered to in the past. Moreover, the XC 120 incorporates one of the biggest trends in boots: a mechanism that toggles between hike mode, for walking uphill or skinning on skis to reach terrain that the lifts don’t, and ski mode, for fast and stable descents. That mechanism itself has been redesigned to provide even more range of motion in hike mode, while ensuring that the boot’s hinged upper shell doesn’t shift while in ski mode and disrupt a smooth descent. The boot also has a heat-moldable liner for custom fit, and extra-grippy soles, as useful for the trek across the parking lot as for climbing up a snowy slope. A comparable women’s-specific style is the XC 90 W ($650). Whispbar | $999 |  The best, and most efficient, way to transport skis and snowboards to the mountain is in an enclosed carrier that protects bindings and bases from road grit, salt and other potentially damaging elements. But carriers are usually accompanied by a noticeable amount of wind noise and drag, which compromises fuel efficiency. That is not the case with this exceptionally aerodynamic carrier, which was introduced last winter and is still best in class. It provides 13.3 cubic feet of cargo space, accommodating skis up to 190 centimeters long, and opens from either side via spring-loaded hinges. The carrier attaches to any roof rack — no tools required — but performs most efficiently with Whispbar mounting rails, whose shape is inspired by wings ($399).
