British Columbia’s Powder Highway
Where is the heart of skiing in North America? A case for the Kootenay Rockies, where winters of 50-foot snows aren’t uncommon.
===
Where is the heart of skiing in North America? Does it beat most vibrantly in ever-popular Colorado? How about Utah, with its talcum snows? Or perhaps Lake Tahoe? No. No. And no. Oh, those are all worthy destinations, but my vote goes to a region that many American skiers and snowboarders have never even visited: the southeast corner of British Columbia. Perhaps no place else on earth possesses such a wealth of ski options as here in the Kootenay Rockies, where the topography accordions spectacularly and winters of 50-foot snows aren’t uncommon. Consider the evidence: eight Alpine ski resorts; 11 Nordic ski areas; 15 snowcat-skiing operations; nine heli-skiing operators, including Canadian Mountain Holidays, which has several operations there. (In fact, the world’s first commercially successful snowcat and heli-skiing operations were born here.) Now add the embarrassment of riches of backcountry skiing for skiers who like to explore beyond the lifts: at least 22 catered backcountry-skiing lodges; plus more than 30 backcountry huts that are mostly booked through the Alpine Club of Canada. And everywhere are mountain ranges, their names talismanic to anyone who adores high peaks: the Gothics. The Adamants. The Selkirks. The Bugaboos. The Valhallas. What makes the region so special, though, has less to do with how it skis than how it  Several years ago somebody named the region with its ski opportunities as “the Powder Highway.” The highway is actually a skein of about five roads that describe a rough circle. Late last March my frequent ski pal, Scott Schell, and I pointed our rig northeast from Seattle on an old-school, 10-day powder trip. On our budget, pricey snowcat skiing ($350 per day and up) and pricier heli-skiing (often $750 and up) were out. Instead we built a Powder Highway Whitman’s Sampler of visits to three resorts and one backcountry lodge. ­ Southeast British Columbia is one of the best places in the world for backcountry skiing. It’s nearly a crime to visit here and not spend some time away from the ski lifts and the crowds and huff up a mountain under your own steam. If you want to get out for more than a day, however, you often need to commit: Nearly all the private huts along the Powder Highway require one-week stays, and most are tucked so high in the mountains that they require helicopter access. We lucked out:  On our second morning we affixed our climbing skins and fell in behind Evan Stevens, an internationally certified mountain guide who now runs the lodge with his wife, Jasmin Caton. We settled into the slow, meditative work of climbing uphill, or “earning our turns.” Yesterday’s blotting storm had blown through. Sunlight fell through tall trees: cathedral light. As we climbed I looked around. This was classic Kootenays country: Furry mountain flanks led up to wide-open slopes flecked with Christmas trees that turned into tall, whale-backed ridges. In the distance reared rocky peaks marked with rocky gullies. “I may be biased,” Evan had said the day before, “but the Selkirks may be the best mountain range for skiing in the world. So many mountains. So few people. There’s big vertical relief. Deep snow — but cold, and dry quality. Glaciers ­” I’d chalked that up to owner’s pride. But now I understood what he meant. Other lodges might be higher and wilder. This place, however, offered an ideal mix of terrain for whatever conditions you might encounter — safe tree-skiing if avalanche danger was through the roof; fun ridge-running for exploration; and uninterrupted, 2,500-foot ski lines spilling from tall peaks for those days when everything looked perfect. After nearly two hours of skinning uphill we reached a bench beneath Pyramid Peak. Untouched mountains were everywhere. “Look at all the untracked pow,” said Evan. First, he led us down a run called Door No. 1. Given the “all clear” sign by our guide, we unleashed one at a time, whooping and swooping down the steep powder run. Then we turned and climbed again and knocked on Door No. 2. It was even better than the first. If backcountry skiing sounds like roughing it, toss out the Grizzly Adams image. Over the last decade B.C.'s private lodges have notched up their games. At day’s end skiers at Valhalla return to a handsome, six-bedroom timber frame affair that sleeps up to 14 people. There is creek-furnished electricity, Wi-Fi and hot showers. There’s indoor plumbing, and a kitchen with a Wolf range. Bedrooms have feather duvets. Groups can bring their own food or pay for catered weeks, which means breakfasts like eggs Benedict, après-ski snacks and salmon dinners. They can hire guides or be self-guided. During our stay we joined a friendly group from all over the West who had rented out the cabin. They skied hard, drank impressive amounts of beer and dove in and out of the wood-fired sauna into frosty snowbanks. Back on the slopes smoke-signal clouds drifted in a blue sky. Another mountain guide and snowboarder who had joined us, Jules Hanna, looked over at me, before we pushed off for Door No. 3. “Hey Chris.” “What’s that?” He grinned. “We’re winning.” And Jules vanished in a magician’s puff of white.­ “I feel we’re doing something wrong,” Scott blurted out. “Twenty minutes after the lifts have opened, and where  “Other than Christmas and New Year’s it’s often like this,” said Cam Shute, an acquaintance who has lived in Nelson for some six years. “That’s why I’m here.” After leaving the Valhallas we had doubled back to Nelson. Half the reason to come to visit the Kootenays is to hang out in Nelson, on the shores of Kootenay Lake — one of the most authentic mountain towns anywhere. (Nelson along with Rossland, about 45 miles to the south, were co-winners of Powder Magazine’s Best Ski Town Throwdown poll in 2012.) Favored by American Vietnam draft dodgers who moved here 40 years ago, the place still has a “turn on, tune in, drop out” vibe. On Baker Street, the main drag, ski and bike shops compete for square feet with stores selling “metaphysical tools.” Yet these adrenaline hippies can ski deep powder way better than you can. Thirteen miles outside Nelson a tight valley clamps shut in an amphitheater of prickly peaks. A few modest lifts crawled up the easier sides of the valley. This is Whitewater Ski Resort. Whitewater is a little frayed — and beloved. Its three chair lifts are slow. The basement’s ski locker room has a gravel floor. What it does have is nearly 40 feet of Kootenay cold smoke powder, some of the best cafeteria chow at any resort and a home­town vibe. We spent our first day exploring the long runs and dodging the thick-necked spruce on the resort’s back side, stopping for an espresso at the food truck that the resort has parked back there. While Whitewater has just 2,044 vertical feet of skiing and 1,184 acres of terrain, it skis bigger than that, perhaps because (unlike other ski resorts) that’s an honest number; you really can ski just about anywhere here. What I really wanted to experience, though, was what Whitewater is best known for besides suffocating snowfalls: steep, easily accessed “side-country” skiing just beyond the area’s boundaries, or fun powder shots for those with avalanche savvy and gear. The next morning we met up with Cam, who agreed to show us around. He had a nut-brown face and a big grin, the result of lots of "field testing” in his job as the product development manager for G3 Genuine Guide Gear, a backcountry ski gear maker. We signed out at the lodge, a policy to let the ski area know when skiers are heading out of bounds, then Cam led us from the top of the Summit chairlift to the side of the area. We affixed our climbing skins and began a 90-minute climb toward 7,867-foot Ymir Peak, the valley’s capstone. As we skied higher, options spilled off Ymir Peak’s ascending ridge line: Pipeline. Prospector Bowl. Eventually, a tilted gully that dropped down the face. Cam called it Bat Cave. “That’s ‘cause the only way out is to fly,” he said, pointing out the 40-foot cliff at the bottom. We’d clearly entered the expert’s terrain. Finally we reached Ymir’s summit and peered over. “I’d say there’s at least a 50-degree roll in the middle. It’s for real,” Cam said. Our ski tips framed the half-full parking lot 3,000 feet below “You can ski a whole morning here and the mountain doesn’t get shredded,” he said, “even when the whole town shows up — and they do!” (One quarter of the 10,000 Nelsonites buy a season ski pass, the ski resort says.) After that we skirted the steepest part of the summit, dropped into the pinched throat of the gully below. Then we opened the throttle on a wide apron of Ymir Bowl and still found untracked snow for another thousand feet or more until the skiing ended at our lunch table. We sat on the deck in spring sunshine, ate Whitewater’s trademark Ymir Bowl (a fresh curry bowl) and French fries with miso-mushroom gravy. ­ The next morning we were on the move. We drove north for hours on snaky roads beside long lakes where snowbanks sometimes seemed the only guardrail. White mountains pushed high overhead. We passed hot springs. We passed logging trucks loaded with trees that kicked up wakes of gravel. For a long time we drove without seeing anyone. (Powder Highway Tips Nos. 1, 2 and 3: Rent a four-wheel-drive vehicle; don’t drive at night; get insurance.) Scott looked at a road map and ticked off the Powder Highway ski options we were passing: Baldface Lodge. Mount Carlyle Backcountry Lodge. Stellar Heliskiing. Retallack. At Upper Arrow Lake the road ended. We crowded onto a car ferry with still more logging trucks, then continued north. Revelstoke sits in a valley beside the Columbia River where the Monashee Mountains shake hands with the Selkirks, and locomotives pause before scaling famed Rogers Pass to the east. “Revy” is known as home to some of the planet’s best heli-skiing and snowmobiling, thanks to big snowfalls and bigger mountains. A few years ago Revelstoke Mountain Resort also opened on the flanks of 8,058-foot Mount Mackenzie, five miles outside of town. The resort has more vertical feet of skiing — 5,620 feet — than anyplace in North America. We parked in the third row the next morning and met up with Mike Bromberg, another internationally certified mountain guide who had moved here a few years ago. “I moved here for the Selkirks, basically,” said Mike, a Canadian who grew up in Texas. Think of this ski hill as a giant cone, Mike said the next morning as we rode Revelstoke’s sole base lift — a gondola. The mountain sprawls as you ski downhill; as a result, “It has a really high rate of people getting lost and spending the night out,” he said. One ski patroller posted a sign at a common confusion spot: An arrow pointing in one direction read, “Back to resort”; a different arrow said, “Night in the woods.” “And a guy still followed it and got lost! He thought it was the name of a ski run,” Mike said. “What I tell first-day skiers here is that a sign that says ‘Cliff’ here really means it. This isn’t Vail, where a ‘Cliff’ sign means, ‘Hey, fun skiing!’ ” We’d timed our visit well again: About eight inches of new snow had fallen overnight. Our first runs like Hot Sauce were scratchy underneath that snow, thanks to recent spring sun. But each run got a little better than the last. We scooted into South Bowl, on the edge of the resort where daily snowcat skiing is offered. It was soft and pleasant and empty, if not very steep. Next, we took the mountain’s highest chairlift, tossed skis over our shoulders and followed a conga line of folks marching uphill past a sign for experts that read “Lemming Line.” Within a few minutes we stood high in North Bowl. It was yet another side of the mountain — a more shaded, deeper side. Around us clouds swirled. Snow spit. But lack of sunshine is the price you pay in these parts for frequently waking to snow that bow-breaks at your knees, as it did when I chased our guide down the mountain. In a few hours we began to tire: There’s a lot of mountain here, and perhaps the most consistent fall-line skiing, anywhere. Get in shape before you come. Mike pointed out that Revelstoke is a great place to pause for several days, thanks to all of its skiing options: Here you can book a day or two of heli-skiing with Selkirk-Tangiers, or Eagle Pass Heli-Skiing. If the bird can’t fly, just head to the chairlifts. A snowcat-skiing operation is also based at the resort. Here, he said, “You can be flexible.” When I’d first visited Revelstoke in the resort’s opening season the place felt like a man-child, galumphing into becoming one of the biggest resorts on the continent. The mountain was enormous but the rest of the place — the amenities, the grooming — couldn’t keep up. The resort couldn’t fit into its body. Seven years later, that was changing. Some improvements are still needed. The scant base area, with just some lodging and a handful of places to eat, feels a bit random and unmoored. More (and free) shuttles should connect town and ski hill. Still, change was noticeable. The resort had thinned some of its forests, offering better tree skiing. The town has changed, too, mostly for the good. There were new stores, places to eat. I worried when I saw a shop selling designer handbags, though. Let’s hope Revy doesn’t try to be what it’s not.­ The wipers slapped at the windshield the next morning as we headed over Rogers Pass and into the great scoop of the Rocky Mountain Trench. More ski destinations blurred past: Great Canadian Heli-Skiing, Kicking Horse Mountain Resort, Purcell Heli-Skiing, Panorama Mountain Village. Three hundred miles later the rental car pulled into Fernie, our last stop on the Powder Highway. If Nelson is the patchouli-scented older sister of the region, than Fernie is the jock little brother. That’s how the local novelist Angie Abdou described her home to me. Founded as a coal town, Fernie is still propped up by mining incomes, but also has a serious skiing addiction, buoyed by the money of Calgary residents, or “CaliFernians,” who ski here on the weekends, Angie said. I’d long wanted to ski Fernie, having heard of its reputation as a snow vortex (the resort averages 444 inches each winter), its great terrain and gorgeous scenery — the ski area sits just five miles outside of town amid the Lizard Range, which in winter resembles a standing wave about to crash over the historic downtown. Five alpine bowls stack up side by side like tilted teacups. “Shall we try Cedar Bowl?” Angie asked the next morning on the chairlift, mentioning the northernmost bowl. Alas, something else awaited us besides a few inches of new snow: a rain crust. Fernie’s Achilles heel is the occasional temperature spike it experiences even in midwinter that can ruin the snow until the next snowfall. Not enough snow had fallen to hide the most recent damage. Meanwhile, woolly clouds clamped down over the peaks. Snow fell. We couldn’t see Fernie’s Kodachrome views. Instead we sped down some nice groomers (Fernie had the best and most extensive grooming we encountered on the Powder Highway) and dabbled in the trees, imagining returning to catch this place when it would smile upon us. After lunch Scott and I took a few more desultory laps and called it quits. We knew not to force it. Besides, after nine days on the road we were frayed. (Tip No. 4: Bite off a section of the Powder Highway that’s geographically sensible — for instance, Red Mountain Resort, Whitewater and a day with Snowwater Heli-Skiing in the south; or Fernie, Panorama and Kicking Horse in the east.) Our 10-day, 1,700-mile road trip from Seattle had yielded some of the best turns of the winter, along with some of the best people and shortest lift lines. We would return, next time armed with more time and more money.
