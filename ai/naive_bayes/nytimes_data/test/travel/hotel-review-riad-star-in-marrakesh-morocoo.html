Hotel Review: Riad Star in Marrakesh, Morocoo
This three-story B & B, situated in the heart of the old city, was once Josephine Baker’s home.

Rates Starting at 140 British pounds a night ($221 at $1.60 to the pound), including breakfast. Basics Riad Star, like many of the riads — small hotels in former homes with courtyard gardens — in the Marrakesh  Location In the heart of the tangled pedestrian alleyways of the medina, Riad Star is near the souks and the Marrakesh Museum, known for the colorful tile work and intricate carvings of the 19th-century palace that houses it. Reaching it is a journey in itself. The manager sends a luggage cart and hired man to pull it to meet guests at the nearest taxi stand at the opening of the old city walls. He then escorts guests on a 15-minute walk through narrow cobblestone lanes, dodging horse carts and threading through souks where spice- and root-filled baskets encroach on the walkways. The Room Centered around the sunny central atrium, each of the seven rooms offers a unique layout and décor, all themed to the Jazz Age or aspects of Baker’s life. Mine, Chiquita, named for her pet cheetah, is the only one on the third-story roof deck, which also includes communal public spaces including chaise longues and sofas. In addition to its own private outdoor seating area, the terra-cotta-tiled and plaster-walled room features a wood-burning fireplace, an L-shaped sofa and a queen bed set within a carved-plaster wall recess. Pierced metal sconces and modern lighting fixtures add drama, and books on Baker underline the theme. The Bathroom Creamy plaster walls contrast with black granite countertops, a pounded-silver sink and ornate silver mirror frame, collectively evoking a sense of boudoir glamour. A roomy walk-in shower and a bathroom entry hall with a mini-refrigerator add utility. Amenities The tiny plunge pool in the lobby atrium is adequate for dangling your feet in after a sweaty day of shopping the souks. There’s also a small hammam, or steam room, off the walled roof terrace where bougainvillea springs from terra-cotta urns and a fireplace is stocked with wood. The manager welcomes guests with a pot of mint tea, a detailed map of the neighborhood and lots of recommendations. Riad Star’s free mobile app offers invaluable GPS guidance around Marrakesh, especially in the medina. Dining Rates include a breakfast of fruit, yogurt, Moroccan crepes, bread and jam with eggs or pancakes optionally cooked to order. Guests can pre-order dinner in the riad for £16 per person, which includes a variety of Moroccan vegetable salads, lamb or chicken tagine and dessert, typically a fresh fruit salad. Bottom Line In the teeming pedestrians-only center of the city, Riad Star offers a quiet and cosseting retreat. Its celebrity history provides a fascinating back story, while personal service manages to make the hotel feel like home.
