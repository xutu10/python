Looking for Moose to Moon Over
My 7-year-old son had seen a moose on TV. I was going to show him the real thing. And so we headed for New Hampshire.
===
My 7-year-old, Henrik, is an animal TV show addict. “Wild Kratts.” “Call of the Wildman.” Old “Crocodile Hunter” reruns. Sure, it’s screen time, but it’s educational, I rationalize — a parental write-off. And yet there’s something disconcerting about watching my son experience so much nature through an electronic medium. We get outdoors plenty, and he gets excited to see a meadowlark through his binoculars. But birds can’t compare with the big moon eyes he gets when he sees a lion, an elephant, a grizzly bear ... on TV. I saw those moon eyes on his face one morning last year, and I looked at the screen and saw a moose. “At 1,800 pounds, the moose is the largest member of the deer family,” the narrator intoned I sat down next to Henrik and whispered: “You know, we can actually go  His trance was broken. “No way! Really?” In that instant, our contract was sealed. I was on the hook to find a moose for Henrik. That’s how we came to be a family of four — Henrik; my 11-year-old son, Anders; my wife, Amy; and me — driving in a Subaru from Ithaca, N.Y., to the moose country of northern New Hampshire one recent weekend. The North Country Moose Festival seemed a good bet for finding moose, or finding somebody who could show us a moose. But I wasn’t taking any chances, so I searched online for a moose guide to take us out the night before. As we drove north and east into the evergreen forests of the White Mountains, Henrik held four stuffed moose toys on his lap. Anticipation built as we encountered road signs warning “Brake for Moose.” Ominous black skid marks were scrawled in the road where cars had swerved and screeched to a stop. Henrik was squirmy after several hours in the car. “Dad, I’m going to close my eyes and watch moose videos in my head,” he said. Around midafternoon we reached Jericho Mountain State Park with only 15 minutes to unpack. As I shuttled sleeping bags into the wooden cabin, other campers on ATVs buzzed this way and that around the campground. Turns out Jericho Mountain is a prime off-road riding destination with a network of dirt trails. Strange that the guide thinks we’ll see moose with so many people riding loud machines, I thought. Then our guide, Keith Roberge, motored up in the ATV equivalent of a Chevy Suburban: a Polaris Ranger with two rows of seats and a pickup bed for hauling coolers. Mr. Roberge climbed out and stood big and tall, a lumberjack of a man at 6 feet 5 inches and 250 pounds, easy. He smiled and handed blue safety helmets to the boys: “Ready to see some moose?” Soon we were bumping along a rocky trail, the boys grinning ear to ear at each hairpin curve and roller coaster dip. “We’re driving by moose right now, you just can’t see ’em!” Mr. Roberge shouted. He nodded at the thicket of aspen saplings, thick as dog hair, on either side of the trail. Mr. Roberge, 40, has been exploring these woods since he was a boy. “That used to be my uncle’s cabin,” he shouted as we motored by a clearing. “It burned down, and the family never rebuilt.” He said there used to be a lot more moose in these parts in the 1990s, “when moose were everywhere.” According to the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, the state’s moose population has dropped by more than 50 percent since 1996, to about 4,400 moose. Biologists say several factors are at play, including outbreaks of winter ticks. “But there are still a lot of moose,” yelled Mr. Roberge as he regaled us with stories. He told of calling in a bull moose with a five-foot-wide rack (“He was so close I could see the white of his eyes”), and of the time he was charged by a young bull. He slowed the machine as we passed what he said was an old logger’s cabin. There, standing among the maples and aspens behind the cabin, was a dark form with four long legs. Mr. Roberge cut the engine and whispered, “moose.” She was a cow moose, apparently fond of the salt lick behind the cabin, because she didn’t bolt when we disembarked and walked to the edge of the woods. Henrik peered through his binoculars and sucked in his breath. It was the first time he’d been silent since we left home. He watched, took a few cautious steps forward, then watched again. And even with his oversize binoculars held to his face, I could see them, the moon eyes. Mr. Roberge let us approach to within 30 yards, which was plenty close for us. (Moose are most prone to charge when cows have young, or bulls are in rut in fall, but it’s always a good idea to keep a distance that doesn’t disrupt their behavior.) We could see our moose batting her long lashes at the bugs buzzing around her face. Occasionally she would shift her weight and move to the other side of the stump that held her salt lick, and Henrik would suck in his breath at this massive thing moving among the skinny tree trunks. Then she lifted her head and seemed to lock eyes with Henrik. He waved at her, keeping the binoculars to his face. Mr. Roberge put us onto five more cow moose at close range that evening and the next morning, but no bulls. So we had a new mission: Find a moose with antlers. For that, we drove an hour north, to the vicinity of the moose festival. For 23 years, the towns of Colebrook and Pittsburg, on the east side of the Connecticut River, and Canaan, on the Vermont side, have been celebrating moose in late summer. This is prime moose-watching territory, home to the famed Moose Alley — Route 3 from Pittsburg north to the Quebec border. We dropped off our stuff at the Peace of Heaven B & B instead, in the moosey area east of Dixville Notch, where the animals wallow along the road in mud holes and lap up water made salty by the previous winter’s road salting. We checked in at the B & B and promptly left for the opening night of the moose festival in Colebrook, where we got free moose tracks ice cream, bought a couple of goofy moose hats for the boys, and signed up for another moose tour. “This’ll be good luck!” Henrik said as he cinched his stuffed moose-head hat on tight. Around dusk, we boarded a big yellow school bus parked in front of a white church. Our driver announced, “My name’s Paul, and we’re gonna go moose hunting.” Paul Nugent is a jack of many trades, including school bus driver. Like the previous day’s guide he had plenty of moose tales to tell, like the time he hiked up a mountain trail and took a break along a footbridge over a brook. While dangling his bare feet from the bridge to cool off, he said he heard a crashing sound coming up the brook. “And wouldn’t you know, here comes a moose,” Mr. Nugent said over his shoulder. “I started talking to it in a low voice and, of course, he had never heard a human before. So he came in closer. I was talking to him, telling him what a beautiful moose he is, and he walked right up under the bridge, and he started licking my feet. He was after the minerals and the salt.” “Oh yeah, I’ve talked to a few moose.” I was smelling bull, not the moose kind, and beginning to regret spending $44 on tickets when we could have driven these roads free. Then Mr. Nugent leapt into action. He pulled over, had us file off the bus and pointed out the moose tracks in the mud at a roadside wallow. I’m not sure why I looked up and to the right suddenly, but I did, and there was a dark form about 50 yards away, trotting right toward us. “Moose,” I whispered. “All right, everybody get near the bus,” Mr. Nugent ordered. Then he dashed into the bus and grabbed a big stick. The moose had ducked into the woods when it saw our party, and he was going in after it. “Be ready to get on the bus quickly,” he instructed before he ran off. I looked at my wife, and she smiled weakly. Then from somewhere in the woods, we heard him say, “Get ready.” Ready for what, we weren’t sure. I took a step closer to the boys. Moments later, the dark form was on the move again, trotting among the trees. It passed through a small clearing behind the wallow, and we all saw it perfectly — the big hump, the bulbous snout held high, and two branches of velvet extending from either side of its head. Henrik had his bull moose. Later I asked Mr. Nugent what the stick was for. He shot me a wry smile. “Because you never know.” The next day at the festival across the river in Vermont, we ate moose burgers (the guy running the grill said they were worried they wouldn’t have any moose meat until one was hit by a car a couple of weeks earlier), and the boys, wearing their moose hats, entered a moose-calling contest and somehow won first prize by groaning and grunting like a cow and bull in rut. Henrik clutched his blue ribbon and was fulfilled. “Best vacation ever.” The next morning, I woke up before dawn and decided to see if that bull moose might be at the wallow again a couple of miles from the B & B. I was sneaking out of the room when I heard a voice. “Where you going, Dad?” It was Anders. Together we sat in the car, parked across from the wallow. After 15 minutes, the broadside of a cow moose — the biggest one we’d seen yet — passed by and ambled down to the wallow. Anders fished his binoculars out of the back seat. “Got her, Dad! I got her!” I had forgotten that before this trip Anders hadn’t seen a moose since seven years ago, when we lived in Minnesota. Half a lifetime ago for him, so in a way he was seeing them again for the first time. Then again, I was giddy, too, watching this big brown freighter ship of a creature disappear into the shadowy balsam forest. I guess it’s true what our first guide told us: “No matter how many times you see a moose, they’ll always get your blood pumping.”
