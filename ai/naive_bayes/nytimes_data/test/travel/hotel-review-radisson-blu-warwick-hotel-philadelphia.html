Hotel Review: Radisson Blu Warwick Hotel, Philadelphia
This refurbished property inside a landmark building is situated in the center of the city, close to a number of top attractions.
===
Rooms from $289. ­Walking into the Radisson Blu Warwick Hotel is like walking into a modern European techno club — which is either good or bad depending on your taste. The Blu brand is literally reflected in light strips surrounding mirrored entryways, while electronic music plays at medium volume in the background of the white and silver lobby. With all new guest rooms, fitness center and lobby, the hotel reopened as a Radisson Blu last November. The exterior of the hotel, a landmark that opened in 1926 as the Warwick Hotel, was mostly left intact during the $20 million renovation. ­A guest with a healthy constitution could easily walk to many of the city’s high points from the hotel, situated in the heart of downtown  ­I paid $171.70 for a Superior room, the smallest category, with one of the deals often available on the hotel’s website. The room was not what I would call generous, but there was ample space to dance around the king-size bed. The contemporary décor was warm, sophisticated and comfortable. A replica Barcelona chair earned the room extra style points. A large flat-screen TV and iHome clock radio with an iPod dock rounded out the offerings because, aside from some Lavazza coffee and tea, the minibar was bare. ­The bathroom was similarly of modest size. Standing at the sink, I was hip to doorknob. The white, rectangular sink itself was large but took away from counter space; the bathtub was full-size. There was a noticeable lack of complimentary toiletries, only bar soaps, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion from the British brand This Works. I was able to call the front desk for a free packet of toothpaste, but there were no cotton swabs. ­The free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel was a big plus. The gym was equipped impressively with about a dozen Precor cardio machines, each with its own TV set, and an entire weight-lifting area with several machines. Free towels, water and apples were also on hand. A nice surprise tucked in the corner of the gym was a coin-operated washer and dryer ($1 per load for each machine). There was even an old-timey laundry soap dispenser. Pets are welcome. Valet parking is available ($40 overnight). ­I ordered a bagel with lox ($18), eggs Benedict ($14) and a large pot of coffee ($12), which room service delivered in a prompt 20 minutes. The hotel has three other dining options, including the Tavern 17, a bar and restaurant that serves basic American dishes in a sophisticated setting; the coffee bar in the lobby offering snacks and caffeine fixes; and the Prime Rib steakhouse, just as you might imagine a steakhouse would be, with black leather chairs and a sumptuous atmosphere. The Prime Rib’s Leopard Room offers live jazz every Saturday night and serves food until 12:30 a.m. ­This refurbished hotel inside a landmark building at the very center of a historic city is a great place from which to explore. ­
