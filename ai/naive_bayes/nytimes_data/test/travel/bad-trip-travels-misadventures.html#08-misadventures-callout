Bad Trip: Travel’s Misadventures
From getting lost at a foreign airport to unexpected encounters with wildlife, many trips are defined by the sometimes maddening, sometimes hilarious, things that go awry.

We’re looking for photos and stories from your misadventures. Share yours at the  Probably someone somewhere has taken the perfect trip, with everything going exactly as planned, no catastrophes or surprises. But I haven’t met that person, and neither have you. To travel is to be exposed to the incomprehensible whims of baggage handlers, car-rental companies, the weather, Yosemite pack mules, pickpockets, noroviruses. If you are unlikely to be able to cope when your flight is diverted to Saskatchewan or your African safari is derailed by a guides’ union strike, you should probably just stay home because, as they say, stuff happens, no matter how skilled you or your travel agent is at vacation planning. And so today we introduce Bad Trip, an occasional feature devoted to travel gone awry. We will share our own tales, but we’d first like to turn the tables and ask you to tell us about trips gone wrong.The intent is not simply to recite mundane tales of woe. The hope is to unearth stories with some unexpectedness, some serendipity, some heft, some moderately profound meaning. Did your wife pick up the wrong bag at the airport and end up slightly inconvenienced? No one cares. Did your wife pick up the wrong bag at the airport and get kidnapped as a result because it contained a nuclear-detonation device coveted by terrorists? Better. Sure, that’s the plot of the 1988 Roman Polanski movie “Frantic,” but you get the idea. We are not interested in garden-variety travel mishaps. But we want to hear from you if, for instance, you were at an airport in La Paz, Bolivia, preparing to fly home after two weeks in that country and this happened: “Our plane was getting ready to board when I realized a Spanish version of my name was being called over the intercom,” my oldest sister, Brenda Mergen, related in recounting a somewhat terrifying misadventure from 2010. “Apparently they had been calling me ever since we had checked in.” She and her husband, Paul (neither speaks Spanish), are artists and had spent two weeks traveling the country, collecting the sorts of objects artists collect. When Brenda went to a ticket counter and conveyed through improvised sign language who she was, she was promptly ushered down creepy corridors and staircases and eventually outside. “I realized I was on the tarmac, and there was my suitcase sitting by itself on what could have been called a table, in the shade of the plane I was supposed to be on, with a guard standing by,” Brenda said. “They beckoned me to open it, which I did. The man searched around and finally pulled out a round metal miners’ lamp with a wire for hanging” — that is, an art object — “looking for all the world like a bomb.” Eventually she convinced them of the harmlessness of the knickknack and they left her to find her way back inside and to the gate. But the nightmare wasn’t over. “About that time I realized that I had handed Paul my carry-on stuff as I left the gate and — you guessed it — all my money, my ID, ticket and passport were in it. Here I was wandering the bowels of an airport in a country where I couldn’t communicate, with no identification and no money to bribe anyone.” Somehow Brenda made it home to Michigan without logging time in a Bolivian prison. The miners’ lamp, though, remains packed away. No one wants that reminder hanging on the wall. But not all travel misadventures call “Frantic” to mind; some are more “National Lampoon’s Vacation.” Say, for instance, your family of four has taken a trip to the Lake George area during a particularly dry year, and the river tubing excursion you attempt has your backside scraping along the river bottom. So you leave the river and try to walk back to your car, carrying your tubes. You come to a field that is roped off with electrified warning tape, but one among you — the man, of course — says, “Let’s walk through here; it’ll be shorter.” Closer scrutiny reveals that the field is a pasture with a herd of pigs in it, but he hops the tape anyway. The beasts take offense and begin moving toward him, and everyone quickly realizes how little they know about pigs. How fast can they run? Are they carnivorous? Fortunately, the family has brought along some treats they thought they’d be consuming while floating gently downriver. Turns out that a good way to distract territorial, possibly homicidal pigs is to hurl Little Debbie snack cakes at them. That one is from a sister-in-law, an episode that, sadly, was not caught on videotape. It’s offered here to show that a Bad Trip story can be ridiculous rather than terrifying or infuriating. And if the unplanned detour or disruption had a silver lining, so much the better. Maybe, for instance, you are a traveling college student trying to get back to Accra, the capital of Ghana, from the countryside and board what you think is a tro-tro, the unmarked vans that constitute the casual transit system in that country. “Accra?” you ask when the van pulls up to you. “Sure,” the men inside say. Only after you’ve been riding awhile do you begin to suspect that the van is not a tro-tro — no one has collected your fare — and is not headed to Accra. “Um, when will we get to Accra?” you ask, knowing that Accra should be only an hour or two away. “Maybe tomorrow or the next day,” you’re told. “We are salt miners. We are going to do some mining, then to Accra.” “Hey,” my daughter Emily said, relating this story to her incredulous parents, “I learned how to harvest salt from seawater through solar evaporation.” Perhaps your story isn’t particularly elaborate. Perhaps it’s just a small anecdote, fortuitous proof that although the god who looks over travelers often seems to be off duty, he or she does occasionally take a moment to check in on us. A dozen summers ago, when my younger daughter, Abby, was 3 or 4, the two of us were jumping in the waves at Misquamicut Beach in Rhode Island while the rest of the family sunbathed. When I returned the child to her mother, Mom did not praise me for being an involved father. Instead she said, “Where’s her other shoe?” I looked down and only then realized that one of Abby’s water shoes had disappeared into the Atlantic while we were frolicking. Didn’t seem like a big deal to me — the shoes cost maybe $3 — but to certain others it was yet another example of my parental incompetence. The travel god apparently knew I couldn’t afford any more such black marks. Two days later a little farther down the beach, I again had Abby in the waves. A particularly big one came in, and I looked down as the water receded. There among the shells and seaweed the wave had brought in was the lost shoe. The most memorable moments of any vacation are often not on the itinerary.
