Transformative Travel, 4 Ways
Follow a photographer to Mexico and Hunter S. Thompson to South America, then head to Brazil for culture and the Galápagos for nature in this survey of four recent books.
===
Latin America has long attracted travelers seeking personal transformation. In the 1950s and ‘60s, the region — with its frenetic cities, uncertain politics, ancient cultures and wild landscapes — served as a sort of screen on which many young writers and artists projected their angst and aspirations. “My last chance to do something big and bad ... " is how an unknown Hunter S. Thompson viewed his own chaotic journey across South America in the early ‘60s. Four recent books take on the theme of transformation of one sort or another, in a region where change has been palpable for centuries. While two linger in the second half of the 20th century, another flashes forward to the present and showcases the cultural metamorphosis that one country, Brazil, has itself gone through. A fourth focuses on arguably the most profound way Latin America can change visitors: through nature. ¡Vámonos! Bernard Plossu in México The French photographer Bernard Plossu was 20 when he first set foot in Mexico, inquisitive, adventurous and ready for anything — a true child of the ‘60s. In 1965 the Beat Generation, which had already chosen Mexico as a backdrop for its own adventures, was giving way to a hippie era of languid self-discovery. Inevitably, Plossu was swept up in the zeitgeist: nomadic road trips, marijuana and all. And though he always had a camera with him wherever he went — from Mexico City to Chiapas and beyond — the last thing on his mind was starting a career as the celebrated roving photographer he would soon become. “It was just a question of fixing all those moments passing by; of capturing the grandiose and magical landscapes of this sublime country,” Plossu says of his prodigious photographic output in “¡Vámonos!,” a lush compendium of mostly black-and-white photos, essays, interviews and excerpts from Plossu’s road notes. And fix those moments he did, from the ethereal portraits of a white-robed Lacandon Maya to roadside scenes of men working on broken-down vehicles, brides in full regalia and children on dusty curbs. Plossu’s fellow travelers are also in these pages — sprawled out on car seats, standing, arms spread, in the middle of an empty highway. Together, they were all on the same journey, “the journey of a generation in the process of constructing itself,” as Salvador Albiñana puts it. The ephemeral feel of Plossu’s photos suggest both a Mexico in transition and the vagabond style of a photographer whose fame was based in large part on a transient lifestyle that led him to many places. But it was Mexico that captured his heart. Again and again he would return: four trips over the next 15 years or so. In subsequent visits, improvisation gave way to more focused themes: the shantytowns and hardscrabble areas of Mexico City, which in his photos seem to be ruled by throngs of children; the border region; areas along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Whatever the specific destination, one image keeps popping up: the road. Whether it is a highway, a city street or a dirt lane, Plossu’s lust for the open road is steadfast. “I photograph it by instinct,” he once said, “because we move forward on it and abandon old habits; we set out for the future, leaving our organized lives in the closet, where they belong.” The Footloose American: Following the Hunter S. Thompson Trail Across South America A few years before Plossu’s first trip to Mexico, another traveler in his 20s went to Latin America in search of adventure of a more calculated sort. “Here was a white man with 12 Yankee dollars in his pocket ... hauling a typewriter, grinning, sweating, no hope of speaking the language, no place to stay,” wrote Hunter S. Thompson in a 1962 article for The National Observer. The “white man” was Thompson himself, who had recently embarked on a yearlong trip across South America, in hopes that the “last frontier” would yield some career-launching stories, including one about the trade in contraband goods. But as his journey progressed, Thompson became increasingly cranky, impatient with bugs and poverty, bumpy truck rides and cities, some chaotic, and others, like Asunción, “as lively as Atlantis and nearly as isolated.” Though he was fascinated by a few places, like Mato Grosso, in Brazil, the overall result of his trip was his transformation into the cynical, over-the-top gonzo journalist he was destined to be. That, in a nutshell, is Thompson’s Latin American adventure story. “The Footloose American” delves into the journalist’s travels and includes another story, that of the author, Brian Kevin, yet another young American, who, recently divorced and more than a little footloose himself, cashes in his frequent flier miles for a flight to muggy Barranquilla, Colombia. His goal: to trace Thompson’s path from the Colombian coast, across the Andes and into Brazil and beyond, in hopes of understanding “how travel in a foreign land could turn a moony misanthrope like Thompson into a shrewd cultural observer.” His quest takes him to cities like La Paz, Bolivia, where people in zebra suits cavort on busy intersections, and Cali, in Colombia, gleaming with laundered drug money, a city where Thompson once watched a British expatriate on his penthouse terrace whack golf balls onto the tin-roofed neighborhood below. In Quito, Mr. Kevin finds a spectrum of tourists, from the “world changers hopping from volunteer gig to volunteer gig” to “hedonists ... partying their way across the continent.” Woven into Mr. Kevin’s encounters with salt workers in Colombia and tin miners in Bolivia are lucid explanations of American foreign policy in Thompson’s time, and South American politics, past and present. Not only does Mr. Kevin fill us in on the careening journey that helped define Thompson as a journalist, but he also delivers an engrossing and opinionated travel guide to modern Latin America. Brazil: A Celebration of Contemporary Brazilian Culture The ‘60s are also evoked in this sweeping, stylish volume of photos and essays, but only as a means to contrast that mostly oppressive decade (1964 marked the beginning of some 20 years of military dictatorship that was accompanied, in many places, by cultural stagnation) with the brilliant, confident display of Brazil’s current creative endeavors. “Brazil,” due out in October, takes on the present, with a capital P. Architecture, art, design, fashion, film, food, graphic design, music, photography and street art are each represented with lavish photos and informative text. Introductory essays by Samantha Pearson and Alcino Leite Neto set the pace for what follows, identifying 20th-century Modernism and the Tropicalismo movements as key influences of contemporary trends. From the Modernist designs of Oscar Niemeyer to the minimalist geometric buildings of Isay Weinfeld, Brazilian architecture is revealed as a particularly rich area. Visitors to urban Brazil, especially São Paulo — where, Marcelo Rezende tells us, “examples of street art ... are more common than trees, competing in number only with automobiles” — will want to check out the street art section, which highlights the works of artists like Alexandre Orion and Ananda Nahu. And readers of the food section may recognize the name Helena Rizzo, whose restaurant Maní, which she opened with her husband, Daniel Redondo, in São Paulo, has become an international foodie destination. The book is a crash course in Brazilian culture. The Galápagos: A Natural History Of all the creatures mentioned in Henry Nicholls’s second book on the Galápagos — among them, foot-long centipedes, toddler-size iguanas, giant tortoises big enough for Darwin to climb atop — perhaps none is so intriguing as homo sapiens, a nonnative species believed to have made landfall on these volcanic islands more than 500 miles off the coast of Ecuador in the early 16th century. Given the capacity of humans to wreak havoc on delicate environments, it is nothing short of amazing that, in the case of the Galápagos, they have not done so. The Galápagos, according to Mr. Nicholls, remain “so relatively untouched, that the act of wading ashore to one if its islands can feel like you are the first to do so.” It seems that the bleak, otherworldly Galápagos have inspired humans to behave with uncharacteristic decency. Of course, continued protection of the islands requires diligence, which is perhaps why Mr. Nicholls, a science journalist and an ardent supporter of all things Galápagos, devotes three out of 10 chapters to humans — what they have done wrong (a period of unregulated population growth, the introduction of invasive species, an oil spill in 2001) and right (stringent protective measures taken by the Ecuadorean government and Unesco’s diligent, unwavering attention). Thankfully, geology, plant life (including wondrous-sounding forests of giant daisy trees) and other creatures are not ignored in this slim, delightful volume. You’ll find sections meted out to invertebrates, reptiles, sea creatures and birds, including not only the “clown-like” blue-footed booby, but also the Nazca booby, “an altogether snazzier bird.” Mr. Nicholls, entertaining in his own right, keeps things lively with lots of human observations. William Beebe, for instance, an American naturalist who, in 1925, explored the waters around the Galápagos, describes rubbing the bright shell of an amiable crab, which “sank down upon the sand, lowered his eyes into their sockets, and wiggled his maxillipeds ecstatically.” And as fascinated as Darwin was with the panoply of weird creatures arrayed before him, he wasn’t always impressed with their looks. Marine iguanas, which he referred to as “imps of darkness,” were in his eyes “most disgusting, clumsy Lizards.” As protective as Mr. Nicholls is of these strange islands, the reader gets the distinct feeling that he wants you to see for yourself these animals that “show no prejudice, no fear " — an experience that will do no less than “transform the way we think about our place in the world.”
