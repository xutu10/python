Restaurant Report: La Parada in Cape Town
Despite inconsistent food, La Parada is the buzziest restaurant on Cape Town’s buzziest street.

If you’re an ambitious Cape Town chef worth your proverbial salt, you’re on Bree Street. Formerly the domain of mechanics’ shops, this downtown stretch has been recently hosting a culinary renaissance. Leading the pack is La Parada, a tapas spot that opened in September 2013. The décor is an unabashed ode to Spain, including vintage travel posters and the gilded bust of a bull keeping a watchful eye over communal tables. On a visit soon after its opening, I was largely underwhelmed: the tortilla Española was bland, the prawn croquettes uninspired, and the patatas bravas, which the menu translates as angry potatoes, might have been more accurately described as flustered. Glitches aside, diners thronged the airy dining room, spilling out onto the sidewalk in good weather. This August, the owners lured the Spanish chef Andrés Conde into the kitchen. It’s not every day that an alum of El Bulli lands in their city, so Capetonians have been clamoring to see what he can do. “I don’t know if people in South Africa know the tapas style,” Mr. Conde said. “My first job was to make customers understand how to eat.” While that effort was underway, he updated the menu to reflect a more authentic pan-Spanish ethos. To encourage sharing, he introduced a huge seafood paella and a three-pound lamb shoulder slow-cooked for 24 hours. The angry potatoes come with more fire now, along with the intensity of smoked paprika. Indeed, smokiness reigns in many dishes, including the vastly improved prawn croquettes. Some items were not as successful, including a still-average tortilla Española and a woeful attempt at a crema catalana. But the garlicky calamari with salsa verde were expertly seasoned, and a succulent lamb basted in honey, garlic, mustard and rosemary was a highlight: Spanish flavors daubed on grilled meat reminiscent of the South African braais (barbecues). Diners shouldn’t anticipate the molecular feats made famous by Mr. Conde’s alma mater: “This is not the language for La Parada,” said the chef, who is sticking to traditional Spanish fare. But that hasn’t dissuaded the crowds, nor has the inconsistent food: La Parada is easily the buzziest restaurant on Cape Town’s buzziest street.
