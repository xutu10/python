In Venice, Navigating Like a Native
What does it take to be a gondolier?
===
It was spring break, and we were going to Venice. Like so many who travel to this part of northeastern Italy, we were lured by the gondolas. My 5-year-old daughter, Meenakshi, was there for the ever-popular and touristy boat ride. I was there to explore the world of gondoliering beyond it. One of the most romanticized images around might just be that of a gondolier in his trademark black pants and striped top, belting out Italian songs as he navigates love-struck couples through the canals of Venice. The experience, complete with the waterways and singing men, has even been replicated at the Venetian Resort and Casinos in Las Vegas and Macau and the Venice Water Town neighborhood near Hangzhou, China. In Venice today gondolas might be employed to give visitors a pricey thrill (around 80 euros, or $100 at $1.25 to the euro, for a 45-minute ride), but they were used nearly a thousand years ago to transport wealthy citizens through the lagoons. The gondoliers were their chauffeurs, and before faster and cheaper motorboats became a mainstay in the mid-20th century, Venetians in the city used the flat-bottom boats to get around. Today, there are just over 400 officially licensed gondoliers — nearly all of them men — who own their own boats and can work in tourism, and a handful of other residents using gondolas or gondola-like boats in their daily lives. Old-fashioned rowing as a means of transportation, an essential part of Venice’s culture, is disappearing, but during our four-day stay, my husband, Mahir, Meenakshi and I immersed ourselves in a world where it continues to thrive. Our journey began at Arzanà, a little-known nonprofit museum in the residential Cannaregio district that houses rare and obsolete boating artifacts. A group of locals enthusiastic about nonmotorized Venetian boats formed the collection in 1992, and visitors are admitted only by appointment with a member. Ours was Nan McElroy, who moved to Venice a decade ago from Atlanta. The 59-year-old is a volunteer for the organization and, along with four other women, also founded Viva Voga Veneta, a nonprofit that promotes traditional rowing in the city. “There is no better way to connect with Venice than with an oar and discovering the original way of life that so few sustain,” she said. She met us in Cannaregio’s main square and led us down a series of narrow alleyways to the two-room, wood-beamed space dating back to the 15th century. We saw many notable frescoes and paintings during our trip, but none made more of an impression than what we viewed that afternoon: We saw a gondola from 1880, lanterns called fanali used to light the boats, locks, or forcole, to fix oars in place, and different kinds of gondola seats for riders from the early part of the century, like ones fashioned from velvet and silk. One of the last remaining felze, a six-foot-long wood and leather cabin used to keep passengers warm in the winter, posed on wood beams in one corner. The museum itself used to be a boatyard called a squero, where gondolas were built and repaired from 1400 until 1920. Only four to six of these squeros remain (the number varies depending on whom you ask), and we got to see one later that day. As was the case with the discreet Arzanà, even many lifelong residents do not know where they are, so we enlisted Maria Sirit, a guide well-versed in gondola life, to help us. We boarded a water taxi at the dock of our hotel on the Grand Canal, the city’s main waterway, and made the 15-minute trip to the Dorsoduro neighborhood. As we approached the squero, a large wooden shed with a small lawn built along a slender canal, we saw nine men lifting up what we later learned was a new gondola and resting it on the water for the first time. The workers did not object to our viewing the half-dozen gondolas in for repairs. Some needed a fresh set of cushions while others had broken oars or scratched wood. As the men worked, they shared details about making and maintaining the boats. Construction of the 33-foot-long vessels, for example, takes three months and involves nine kinds of wood. And that just-completed boat we saw cost a cool 35,000 euros, the bare minimum price. After that, annual upkeep averages 5,000 euros. Given the startling expense, I wanted to understand why anyone would choose gondoliering as a profession. It turns out the attraction is tradition, not wealth. Ms. Sirit introduced us to Roberto Veanelo, 53, a gondolier who said that he followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and expects his son Oscar, 15, to do the same. "There is nothing else I know how to do but this work," he said. And, as he told us, the job takes more than a decent voice. The first steps are passing a boating test around the channels, followed by an oral exam on Venetian history. Next is three months of school to learn more about art and history and also to brush up on languages; gondoliers are required to speak three, he said. The last part is a written exam and rowing six people in a gondola around the lagoons. “It might look easy to stand on the boat and row, but it’s actually very physically demanding,” he said. The next day we discovered he wasn’t exaggerating when we tried to row ourselves. I had signed us up for a 90-minute lesson through Row Venice, an organization that teaches visitors the old-school way of moving through the water. Jane Caporal, 52, an Englishwoman who married a Venetian, started the business in 2008 after being drawn to the centuries-old way of life unique to Venice. “To keep rowing alive, you need to open it up, and that’s how Row came about,” she said. Ms. McElroy also works with Ms. Caporal to run Row, and she turned out to be our instructor. Instead of using a classic gondola, the group teaches on a batela, a rare wooden shrimp-tailed boat that’s slightly more stable but requires the same kind of upright rowing as a gondola. We met on a late sunny afternoon by a canal in Cannaregio and stepped into the batela eager to learn. But before untying the rope that kept us docked, Ms. McElroy had us practice what seemed like fairly straightforward strokes: Stand up straight holding the wooden oar, thrust forward the oar while lunging with one leg, and pull the oar back toward the chest. Repeat. The challenge kicked in once we were out on the water. The current seemed gentle, but we were rowing against it, and it took an unexpected amount of core and upper-body strength to keep moving. Despite my regular exercise routine of running and interval training, I was out of breath within a few minutes and lost control of the oar at least a half-dozen times. Mahir took over but didn’t last much longer than I did before turning to Ms. McElroy for relief. The motions became marginally easier the more we did them, but we weren’t sorry when we were done because the time had come to really live like the locals. It was close to 7 p.m., and we were going bar- or bàcari-hopping on the boat. Our lesson ended at Fondamenta Misericordia, a waterway lined with at least a half-dozen affordable spots serving tasty bites called cicchetti. At the small, contemporary Vino-Vero, for example, we could choose thick crostini slices with toppings like Sicilian tomatoes and anchovy or speck with arugula for 1 to 2 euros each, while the dozen or so wines and proseccos by the glass weren’t more than 3 euros. We ordered an assortment of food and drinks to enjoy on the batela, with the sunset and a half-dozen other rowboats filled with imbibing Venetians as our backdrop. “Not that you won’t see speedboats moving from bar to bar for cicchetti, but this is the time when the people in Venice who still rely on gondolas and other nonmotorized boats come together,” Ms. McElroy said. By the end, we were too full for dinner and satisfied that we had ventured deeply into gondola life, but Ms. Caporal told us the next day that watching one of the many annual races between 20 or so of the city’s rowing clubs was another option. Our stay didn’t coincide with any, but Ms. Caporal, who is part of the Remiera Canottieri Cannaregio team, said that gondolas and other row boats compete on the lagoons on Sundays throughout the year. “Watching them is a good way to connect with the community trying to preserve the original way of getting around Venice,” she said. They might be used in speed racing, but the actual gondola ride tourists look forward to is more of a crawl, and on the last afternoon of our trip, it was finally time to indulge Meenakshi in one. The three of us boarded the boat on a picturesque 60-degree day along the canal near San Marco Square. As we glided us down the wide Grand Canal lined with centuries-old palaces, Mahir and I reveled in the warm sun and the abandoned joy on Meenakshi’s face. We posed for pictures at the end with obligatory wide grins. I looked around and saw the camera-happy riders in other boats, and in that moment, I became one of the many travelers who come to Venice from all over the world with dreams of riding in a gondola.
