Casting for a Big Fish on the Big Island of Hawaii
Ulua can weigh well over a hundred pounds. So how, exactly, do you haul one in from the shore?
===
The ulua, also known as a giant trevally, or G.T., is a brute among fish. It’s linebacker-shaped, all blunt forehead and blocky torso, with the thin, bladelike fins of a high-speed ocean predator. Trophies can reach well over a hundred pounds of silver-clad muscle. Catching one is like towing a Volkswagen Beetle with your arms and a stick, then pulling it up a cliff. That’s right: cliff. The ulua we are discussing here are fished from a high, rocky Hawaiian shoreline. Any fool can hire Captain Quint and go plunder the deep sea. Ulua fishing, island style, means no boat, no sonar to track your monster, no mates to land it for you and winch it high for manly posing at the dock. It’s just you, with a rod and bait, plus muscle and courage. That is what I tried to muster on a trip to the Big Island of Hawaii in May. The island, with its smoldering volcano and jagged-lava coastline, is the best place in Hawaii for shoreline ulua fishing, and I went there to find one of the island’s best ulua fishermen, Desmond Valentin, a 40-year-old member of the Hilo Casting Club. Desmond holds the club’s ulua record, for a 136.6-pound fish he caught in 2010. It landed him on the cover of Hawaii Fishing News In May, Desmond had made the cover again. The photo showed him standing cliffside in swim trunks and sandals, belly-to-belly with an 89-pound ulua. His brown tattooed arms are bent and locked as he holds up his prize, his fists deep into its blood-red gills. The ulua’s eye glares and its mouth hangs open, in the disbelieving frown universal to defeated fish. Desmond’s face is mostly hidden by his forearm, but his eyes are smiling. The fish looked big enough to swallow his head. The sun was sinking over Ka Lae, or South Point, the bottom corner of the fat triangle of the Big Island, the southernmost point in the United States. Desmond’s truck heaved and dipped on red-dirt ruts as if on ocean swells. We were headed to the edge, a high, dusty promontory that drops off in a jumble of lava and coral, where two deep-ocean currents meet and huge fish gather. South Point is thought to have been the first landfall of the Polynesians who sailed up in ancient times from the South Pacific. Hawaiians have been fishing there for maybe a thousand years. I had met Desmond, a short, muscular man with tousled black hair and an ulua tattoo on his left arm, that morning at  “One of the most important things is, always respect the water,” he said, “because the ocean can kill you at any time.” Desmond parked under a lighthouse, near the stone ruins of a fishing heiau, or temple, built under King Kamehameha the Great, who united the islands in the 18th century. We walked toward a tarp to say hello to a couple of fishermen who were carrying on the tradition. They were camped out, with nylon cots and instant coffee and beef stew. The wind whipped at our backs, heading out to sea, as it always does at South Point. Hawaiians of old fished from canoes, and historical markers on the cliffside at South Point point out smooth holes for mooring ropes punctured in the lava centuries ago. We walked to where several rods were lined up, stepping carefully around knife-edged pockmarks in the lava that had been drenched by earlier waves and were now ringed with salt. The challenge in catching ulua from shore starts with getting a baited hook in front of a fish. You use a 12½- to 13-foot graphite rod, custom-made for ulua, light but very stiff. The reel is loaded with about 250 to 300 yards of 80-pound monofilament line, which holds up better than braided line when rubbed against rocks and coral. The hooks are fat and the lead sinkers have wire prongs, to hold the bottom in strong currents. Casting with bait is impossible at these heights and distances — the combination of sinker, leader and heavy baited hook would lead to a helicoptering tangle of lines. So you cast a line with the sinker alone, like a bullet. Then you take a separate leader with a hook on one end and a corkscrewlike sliding clip on the other. Hook on some fresh bait — often octopus or eel, whole or in chunks — clip the leader to the main line and zip it down to fish-level. Then place the rod in a holder, a cowbell on the rod tip, set the drag and wait. Waiting is slow. It can take all night. It can take days. The fishermen we met were in no rush. “This past couple months we been holding this spot,” said one of them, Edwin Cabanting. “We got a lot of friends who want to fish over here, so we just alternate to hold the spot for the tournament.” Ulua fishing is a working-class sport, and competitors are serious amateurs. Edwin is a retired sanitation worker. Desmond works for a cesspool company; he couldn’t get free till the weekend. Edwin poured coffee for Desmond and me, and I listened as they talked about fishing. The rhythm: “Some days we sleep a lot. Some days we fish a lot.” The competition: Sea turtles, which steal bait, and monk seals, which scare fish away. Sharks — Galápagos, white tips, brown reef sharks, tigers — which are no fun to catch; when you have one on the line, you cut the line. The techniques: Some fishermen solve the casting problem with a more exotic trick peculiar to South Point — they tie a weighted line to a large inflated trash bag that carries it out far on the offshore wind. Trash-bag fishermen catch sailfish, tuna, mahi-mahi and other big-game creatures, but are not generally fishing for ulua. Their tactics are not sanctioned by the Tokunaga tournament. ­ It soon was dark, with no stars. I asked Edwin about the spookiness, with the temple ruins behind us. “We try not to swear around here, be respectful,” he said. Once in a while, he said, they placed stones wrapped in ti leaves by the heiau, a Hawaiian gesture of respect. And, like many in Hawaii who give credence to tales of the supernatural, they kept an eye out for the Night Marchers, ghostly apparitions said to walk ancient seaside trails at night. Or a woman in white riding a horse: the volcano goddess, Pele. “One time I was over there with my friend,” Edwin said, pointing up the coast. “I went to look for him, I saw some of his gear on the rocks, my hair just stood up, so I packed up and I left. He got scared — he told me he saw the lady on the horse.” At some point Desmond cut him off — he thought he had heard the bell on a rod. We hadn’t, but he was sure of it. “I heard that loud and clear —  We went and looked: nothing. The conversation resumed. “We love to fish nighttime,” Edwin said. “We’ll probably stay up all night, until about 3, 4 o’clock.” “As soon as you fall asleep,” Desmond said, “that’s when it’s going to strike — zing!” “Or when you eating dinner.” “Right when you get ready for deep sleep, that’s when.” ­ The scariest part of ulua fishing isn’t seeing ghosts or losing sleep, it’s getting a fish to shore. Fish are pulled up using a slide gaff that is tied to a rope and sent down the main line, the same way you deliver bait. Landing a fish this way sounds straightforward, but the dangers are self-evident: clambering over slick, sharp, wave-battered rocks at great heights — often in the dark. If OSHA covered ulua guys, they would be wearing safety harnesses, neoprene wet suits, crash helmets, spiked boots and armored gloves. What they actually wear are T-shirts, shorts and rubber slippers. Or tabi, Japanese booties, to keep the lava from shredding their feet. Desmond told me that ulua guys rely on caution and common sense, knowing the constant risk of being swept out to sea: “Always try to have a partner in case something goes wrong. He can throw you a cooler, a floating device, a rope, something — or cast another pole out and you can wrap your hand around the line, he can pull you in. He can call 911.” Desmond had to be at work early the next morning, so we drove back to Hilo, through a gentle rain. Outside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, the low sky above the ohia forest glowed red-orange, as if irradiated, from the lava that has been flowing out of Kilauea volcano since the early 1980s. I went alone the next day to one of the most beautiful spots for ulua fishing and one of the most treacherous: MacKenzie State Park, in the Puna district, southeast of Hilo, lushly overgrown with ferns and ironwood trees. The camping and picnicking area ends abruptly at the ocean in a high, vertical, black-brown lava ledge, as if God had broken off a lava brownie with his thumbs. A southern swell was raging against the cliffs when I got there, hoping to do some fishing of my own. Signs warned of the risk of imminent death: The ledge was unstable and could break off at any time. Near one sign stood a small wooden cross, draped in a wilted flower lei. The low whoomp of waves smashing rock said: Maybe you don’t want to do this. I left my rod in the car, and went over to talk with some fishermen sitting in folding chairs under a tarp by their trucks. They had a little ulua — maybe 18 pounds — on ice in a cooler. They had placed their rods in holders at the edge of the cliff, and another one farther out, on a promontory jutting like a ship’s prow into the waves. Getting to it required hiking down the cliff, crossing wet rocks, then Spider-Manning up again to the rocky point. This was where Desmond had caught his 89-pounder. I was taking a photo of the spot, in what I thought was a respectful distance from the edge, when — blam — I got drenched by the splatter of a huge wave. I felt a flash of embarrassed irritation, plus a little surge of fear. “I used to get mad,” Desmond had told me, “because when get choke wind” — “choke” is Hawaiian slang for “plenty” — “the water spray on me, and so I used to yell, attack the ocean, swear at the ocean. My Uncle Rody told me, brah, you cannot do that, ’cause you gotta always respect the ocean. And I was like, ‘Aaah, never.’ And he got mad at me for doing that, which he had the right to. “The next fishing trip that I went, before I set up camp and everything, I walked up to the point and I said my apology. I went, ‘I’m sorry, I apologize, last time I was here I was swearing at you, I just want to apologize.'” Desmond dates his fishing good fortune to that cliffside reconciliation. To him success requires good karma above all, but also good ears, to hear when your moment arrives over the constant crash of waves. “If it’s only the bells, it’s probably one lobster or papio” — a baby ulua — “playing with ’em, pulling on your bait. But when you hear that ratchet, oh my God. That is like music to your ears. You hear that, it’s like: YESS!” The zinging of the drag is the beginning of the death struggle. You’ll know it’s an ulua from the pop and fight in the rod — a big shark on the line, by contrast, is like a truck rolling away from you in neutral. When it’s a ulua you have to be careful taking the rod out of its holder, so it’s not yanked out of your arms. You try to hold your ground. Then you try to pull the fish in your direction, click by click on the reel’s ratchet. Landing the 136.6-pounder took 45 minutes, Desmond said, that felt like hours. “My arms were just cramped up. Locked up. At the end, honestly, I wanted to quit. I wanted to put that pole down and just rub the line on the rocks. Because I was just so tired. I wanted to quit.” But all he could think of — besides resting — was his uncle and friends teasing him for letting a monster get away. “I had to put the pole right here,” Desmond said, showing how he held it to his chest and wrapped it in two deadened arms. “I had to hug it and then pull, just put the butt on the ground and just pull it, and watch the tip slowly just ­ “It was just dead weight. All your veins are popping, everything’s so sore, your lower back especially. In the beginning it’s not so bad. During the fight and the ending part, your lower back. Literally you gotta go on your knees almost, and just try to hold that pole.” The fish, eventually, gave up before Desmond did. He dragged it onto the pavement. He lay down beside it and closed his eyes. ­ Driving back to Hilo from MacKenzie, I marveled at Desmond’s low-key gonzo heroism. Lacking that, as well as the right equipment, calm seas, ample time and a fully suppressed survival instinct, I realized that a monster ulua was not in my immediate future. But I did stop at a beach park just outside Hilo, on the eastern shore, where the shallow water in late afternoon was glassy. A stand-up paddle boarder glided slowly by, as if poling on the bayou, though this was the Pacific Ocean. I stood on rocks and looked down at three sea turtles, grazing on a ledge. For an hour or so I cast and retrieved a little rubber worm, hoping for a papio.
