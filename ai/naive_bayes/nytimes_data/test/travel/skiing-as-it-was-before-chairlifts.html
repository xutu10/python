Skiing as It Was Before Chairlifts
Ski mountaineering or skinning — propelling yourself up the mountain before swooshing back down — is a throwback to the sport’s early days.
===
Beads of sweat trickled down my back, forming an icy pool where my thermal top had ridden up. My heart, drumming a furious, hard-rock beat, accompanied the loud gasping of my breath. Reaching forward with one arm, I stabbed my pole into the snow-covered ground, slid the opposite leg forward and continued to ski up the mountain at La Fouly, a small, four-lift resort in the Valais region of  Known as ski mountaineering, Alpine touring or skinning, this is skiing much as it was before chairlifts: you propel yourself up the mountain before swooshing back down. For years, skinning remained primarily the domain of backcountry skiers, those adventurous athletes who ventured off slope to ungroomed, unmarked, unpatrolled terrain. Today, people skin to reach isolated sections of a mountain, to search out fresh, deep powder or for the calorie-torching workout. And, it’s no longer limited to off-piste ground. “It’s taking over at resorts,” said Tyler Cohen, managing editor of Backcountry Magazine. “It’s a good way to get in shape before the conditions are ready for backcountry skiing. It’s a great way to squeeze in a run and a workout before or after work. And, it’s a different way to experience skiing.” An enthusiastic downhill skier, I spotted my first skinners battling uphill a year before my own huffing-and-puffing attempt. From the comfort of a gondola, I would pull up my neck warmer or yank on my mittens and study a man dripping with sweat or a woman in just short sleeves, working his or her way up the slopes of the Swiss Alps below. Curious, I grilled all the people I met who mentioned they skinned until, in late January, my friend Greg Stewart said, “I’ll take you tomorrow.” My questions — is it as hard as it looks? how did you get into it? – quickly turned to the practical: What do I wear, do I need special equipment? I decided that I would wear my normal ski clothes, rent equipment and bring a backpack with water and my helmet. The equipment looks similar to traditional skis with an added removable, synthetic skin on the bottom. Historically made of seal skin, the carpetlike base has fibers that let you glide forward, but catch on the snow to keep you from slipping downhill. The lighter, more flexible boots clip into bindings that allow the heel to lift on the ascent, but clamp down on the descent for stability. The logistics squared away, Greg’s face turned serious, and he said, “There is one important condition.” I tensed, expecting some life-or-death, avalanche-related rule, but the edict was far less vital: “You must call me Captain Handsome.” As I was new to the sport, we would stick to on-piste skinning so my nervousness was unnecessary, but the capricious nature of off-piste snow poses a real risk. When a typical skier avalanche is triggered, it travels at about 30 miles an hour. Often people are swept down the mountain a long distance, risking collision with rocks and trees. If buried, most victims suffocate, enclosed by snow that increases in density as it settles, becoming cementlike. In Switzerland, more than 100 avalanche accidents a year involving people are reported to the  Off-piste skiing isn’t just an into-the-wilderness, backcountry run. Lift-served skiers who venture off the slopes near or close to a resort are considered out of bounds as well, and the resulting danger is one reason many uphill skiers stick to the slopes. But the increased interest in on-piste skinning is a growing issue for resorts. Skiing uphill requires no lift ticket, the industry’s largest source of revenue. There’s also liability concern over potential collisions between uphill skiers and downhill skiers or grooming tractors working off hours. Resorts handle the increased uphill traffic in different ways. Copper Mountain in Colorado allows uphill skiers on slope during nonoperating hours after they’ve picked up a free uphill-access pass and signed a waiver. Whitefish Mountain Resort in Montana has two designated routes for uphill skiers. Killington in Vermont combines the policies, offering an Uphill Travel Pass for $20 and designated routes. In Switzerland, lifts are owned by companies, but the mountains are public terrain and skiers have the right to roam on them by foot, snowshoe, ski or snowboard. So, after I rented skis, boots and poles, we lugged our gear up a soft slope at La Fouly. We clipped into our skis, and Greg showed me how to use the heel elevators, a stepladder-like device on the bindings that lifted the back of my foot as if I were in stilettos. The elevator gives the heel a higher resting position for steep inclines, reducing the angle of the climb and leg fatigue. Under indigo skies, we began our ascent. Instinctually, I lifted one foot and then the other, clomping forward clumsily as if wearing long, thin snowshoes. Greg, a few feet behind me, yelled up to tell me to keep my feet on the ground and just slide forward. After a few awkward, herky-jerky attempts, the gliding movement became more natural. Within 10 minutes, my breath was heavy, as if I had been jogging. We stopped to rest, sip water and admire the sharp peaks that separate Switzerland, France and Italy. Skiing was introduced in the Alps by Norwegian and English mountaineers in the late 19th century. The sport took off in the early 20th century even though the first lift — a rope tow — wasn’t built in Europe until 1928. During World War II, skiers were mostly military troops, some of whom created ski mountaineering competitions to test their ability. After the war, as chairlifts became more readily available, there was a split between downhill skiing and ski mountaineering. While downhill skiing dominated in the United States, skiing the old-fashioned way — touring — remained prominent in Europe. Recreational hut-to-hut tours throughout the Alps are common. Skinning competitions, based on those the military created during the war, were revived in the 1990s and now draw crowds of more than 50,000. The Patrouille des Glaciers, held in Switzerland every two years, involves thousands of skiers climbing 13,000 vertical feet over 33 miles. The first world championship was held in France in 2002. And, the International Ski Mountaineering Federation hopes to make it an Olympic sport. Staring at the sharp faces of the mountains opposite us, I understood the crowds cheering on these athletes and the desire to deem the sport Olympics-worthy. And, I was grateful to be on a comparatively gentle, groomed trail. We shifted forward and began to climb a steep section of the slope, but I started to slip backward. Greg shouted instructions, directing me to zigzag across the trail so I could ascend at a more gradual incline. I moved quickly across the slope to avoid colliding with any downhill skiers, then kick-turned and strode to the other side. My breath was now shallow and rapid, as if I had been sprinting. We climbed on with Greg encouraging me along the way and helping shift my heel elevators up or down. An hour and 18 minutes later we reached our destination, an igloo-shaped cafe partway up the mountain. We had traveled just 1.36 miles. I stepped out of my skis, dropped to my knees, peeled off the purple skins, rolled them up and tucked them into my bag. I pulled off my hat, realized my hair was matted with sweat, and shoved it back on my head. I looked at Greg, his face flushed, and thought no one would mistake us for Captain Handsome and his sidekick. Greg handed me a beer and we stood outside watching skiers shove off the chairlift until we were ready to carve our way down the mountain. Then I strapped on my helmet and skis, clasping the heel down, and took off. Less than five minutes later, I reached the base. Still gassed from my climb, I leaned on my poles and watched skiers queue for the lift. I was sweaty and satisfied, depleted and strangely invigorated. I was filled with a sense of accomplishment and a profound appreciation for the invention of the chairlift.
