Tourists Urged to Avoid Ebola Zone in West Africa
As the world grapples with the outbreak, guidance for travelers.
===
The Ebola outbreak has gripped broad swaths of West Africa, reaching Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal. According to the World Health Organization,  It would be an understatement to say that travel to these countries is problematic. The C.D.C. has issued a Watch Level 3 warning (“avoid nonessential travel”) for Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and a Level 2 warning (“practice enhanced precautions”) for Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Tourists should not visit these areas. The C.D.C. has recommended that foreign exchange, research and other education-related travel be postponed until further notice. Although the situation can change rapidly, there is now no risk of contracting Ebola in countries in West Africa without reported cases. Ebola is a viral illness, spread by direct contact with the blood, urine, saliva, feces, vomit or semen of an infected person. It is also spread by direct contact with infected fruit bats, monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees or their meat, and by contaminated objects like needles or soiled bed linen and clothing. “It’s almost inevitable that cases will turn up here,” said Stephen S. Morse, an epidemiology professor at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. “But there’s very little danger to us in the U.S. because it has no natural host here, and really no way to become a disease like West Nile virus.” The virus is not transmitted by coughing or sneezing or otherwise through the air, so avoiding direct contact prevents spreading the disease. Objects and surfaces can easily be disinfected with household bleach. The reported fatality rate in West Africa is about 70 percent, but Dr. Ben Neuman, a widely published virologist at the University of Reading in England, said that may change. “There’s a surge of new cases now and we’ll see whether they survive or die,” he said. “We’re underestimating the death rate now.” It can take as long as three weeks after initial infection for symptoms to appear, but being near an infected but asymptomatic person, on an airplane for example, is not a problem. “The virus comes out in the last days before a person dies,” Dr. Neuman said. “They have horrible diarrhea, they’re vomiting. Sitting next to someone who has Ebola but no symptoms is not dangerous.” Anyone in the affected countries who gets a fever and symptoms like headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain or unexplained bleeding or bruising should avoid all contact with others and travel immediately by private transportation to a doctor’s office or hospital. Consular officers from the U.S. embassies can help in finding medical services and informing family and friends, and although the State Department will not pay medical expenses, they can help transfer funds. But travelers to these regions should be aware that any country has the right to restrict exit and entry of apparently infected people, impose quarantines, and take other measures that some may view as infringements on individual rights. The government of the United States has little or no influence in such matters. Vaccines are under development, but the soonest they will be available is in about two months, and it may take years. Some antiviral medicines have been used, but none has proved effective. In the meantime, prevention and palliative care are the only effective approaches. The C.D.C. suggests that travelers returning from West Africa, even those without symptoms, visit a doctor when they arrive in the United States. The doctor will evaluate the traveler and consult with public health authorities to decide what further actions to take. Those who were in an area with an outbreak should monitor their health for 21 days after their return, taking their temperature daily and watching for other symptoms. Anyone with symptoms should stay away from others and call a doctor immediately. The danger should not be exaggerated, Dr. Morse said. “The risk of infection even if you go there, unless you visit a family where there is an Ebola patient or visit a patient in a hospital, is very small. On the other hand,” he said firmly, “if you don’t have to go there, don’t.”
