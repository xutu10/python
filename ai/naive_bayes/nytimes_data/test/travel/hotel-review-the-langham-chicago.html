Hotel Review: The Langham, Chicago
Opened last September along the Chicago River, Langham’s fourth property in the United States pays careful attention to service and design.

Rates Starting at $395 for a “grand room.” Basics Opened last September, this 316-room hotel favors an understated elegance fitting its landmark riverfront location. Occupying the ground through 13th floors of the I.B.M. Building, now AMA Plaza, the sleek, black 1973 skyscraper is the last work of Mies van der Rohe. The empty plaza in front of the building and the ground floor lobby, with its white marble walls and minimalist, midcentury furniture, are reminders of the building’s corporate origins. While the entrance lacks warmth, a legion of friendly concierges — the women dressed in pink Jackie O-style suits — whisk you to the check-in desk on the second floor, with its dangling Czech glass baubles and large-scale paintings by modern and contemporary artists. Location Sitting along the Chicago River, the hotel is steps away from other architectural marvels like Marina City and the neo-Gothic Tribune Tower. The river walk features gardens, docks for boat cruises and a few outdoor restaurants. It’s a lovely passage to Michigan Avenue, where you can find the city’s high-end shopping, museums and Millennium Park along Lake Michigan. The hotel is within walking distance of several El stations. The Room Our grand double room sported camel-colored décor with punches of mauve and black as well as two comfortable full beds, a desk, a sitting area, a flat-screen television and ample closet space. The ingenious feature was the minibar, reimagined as an upright credenza whose drawers revealed a Nespresso machine, Dean & DeLuca nuts and chips and a minifridge stocked with juice and Moët & Chandon Champagne. Upon my return to the room in the early evening, I found the staff had set a tea service on the table and tuned the radio to classical music. The Bathroom It is a sanctuary, with two sinks set into Alaskan white granite, a bathtub and a rain-forest shower as well as an array of hair care products, soaps and lotions from the hotel’s Chuan Spa. The two fluffy, white terry cloth robes and slippers laid out for the evening were also a nice touch. Amenities Inside the hotel’s health club is an aqua blue 67-foot swimming pool, with glittering lights above it and a view of the Chicago River, as well as a gym and a Jacuzzi. The changing rooms include saunas and a steam room. Adjacent to the pool is Chuan Spa with services like a 30-minute herbal salt scrub starting at $105 and a one-hour Swedish massage starting at $165. At the hotel’s second-floor restaurant, Travelle, the American chef Tim Graham offers his takes on Mediterranean food, serving dishes like pomegranate braised lamb shank and boar ragù for dinner during my stay. The dining area and the gold-inflected bar ooze with a clubby, Swinging Sixties vibe, both designed by David Rockwell. Room Service Available 24 hours, it is prepared by Travelle. The eggs Benedict ($21) and yogurt parfait ($12) arrived quickly on a white-table-clothed cart and were delicious, though the cappuccinos ($6) were slightly tepid. Breakfast in the Pavilion daily until 11 a.m.; reservations are required for the afternoon tea. Bottom Line Langham’s fourth property in the United States pays careful attention to service and design and manages to overcome the building’s corporate feel to provide an elegant, tasteful stay.
