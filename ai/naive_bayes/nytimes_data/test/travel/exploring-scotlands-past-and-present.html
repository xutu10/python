Exploring Scotland’s Past and Present
Ronald D. Moore, executive producer of the TV series “Outlander,” talks about finding an ancient house with secret passageways, the best food he’s had in the country and more.

The television producer Ronald D. Moore is best known for projects that mix high concept with high altitude, from his early work as a writer for “Star Trek: The Next Generation” to his 2004 “Battlestar Galactica” reboot. More earthbound is his latest series, “Outlander” on the Starz channel, an adaptation of a novel by Diana Gabaldon. It charts the fortunes of a World War II-era nurse who finds herself transported to 18th-century Scotland, where she encounters both political and romantic turmoil in the Highlands. The scouting of castles and lochs for shooting held its own charms, but it was the Scots themselves who drew Mr. Moore and his family to the country. “The people are just unfailingly nice,” Mr. Moore said. “It’s really remarkable.” Below are edited excerpts from the conversation.  Q. How was traveling with children?  A.   What would you suggest for a glimpse of Scotland’s medieval past?  Doune is a great place to start. It’s easy to get to, about a half-hour, 45 minutes outside of Glasgow. It’s the best preserved example of a medieval castle left in Europe. Most of the castles from that period were added on to, but Doune is pretty much exactly the way it was. It was the castle used for “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” and if you go there today, there are still coconut shells for sale in the gift shop. We use Doune for Castle Leoch in the show. The house we rented nearby was older than the castle. It was originally a tower, literally a fighting tower with little arrow windows in it. The house had secret passageways — no kidding, secret passageways. There’s a place where you pull on a candlestick and the wall opens, like “Young Frankenstein.” It’s wild. Renting a place like that was amazing for the kids, obviously. It had its challenges in terms of modern living, but it still is a fascinating place. Favorite place to eat? North of Glasgow you start getting into the real Highlands, which is beautiful country. There’s this great family-owned restaurant called Mhor Fish in the village of Callander. They’re outstanding restaurateurs — that’s probably the best food we’ve had in Scotland. It’s run by this really eclectic group of people and their friends. They hang out with guests and serve drinks at the bar, and just make great food. Oysters, mussels, really great sandwiches, fresh lamb, things like that. What’s next?  We’re still shooting the first season. We don’t wrap until the end of September, but we are starting to think about Season 2 already. That will bring its own challenges. The second book has a big chunk that takes place in the Paris of the 18th century, and we have to put our heads together and think about how to recreate Paris in Scotland.
