Alibaba Third Point, Viking Global Investors, Paulson & Company and Soros Fund Management were some of the hedge funds that disclosed sizable ownership stakes in Alibaba when they submitted filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. The regulatory filings, known as 13-Fs, are quarterly updates from large money managers about their holdings in stocks traded in the United States. Viking Global Investors, the fund led by O. Andreas Halvorsen, reported having about 11 million shares of Alibaba, while Daniel S. Loeb’s Third Point reported a stake of 7.2 million shares. Soros Fund Management, which manages the wealth of George Soros, had 4.4 million Alibaba shares. John A. Paulson’s fund said it had 1.9 million shares. Also reporting a large stake in the Chinese company was Tiger Management, led by Julian Robertson. It said it had about 1.2 million shares. Moore Capital, the fund led by Louis Bacon, reported having 1.5 million shares. Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors and Barry Rosenstein’s Jana Partners disclosed holding smaller stakes in Alibaba. BlueMountain Capital Management disclosed it owned 303,031 shares, while Appaloosa Management said it had 725,000 shares. Even the family office of Stanley Druckenmiller, the billionaire investor, said it had 10,000 shares. Alibaba raised about $22 billion in one of the largest I.P.O.s ever. Investor interest in Alibaba had built up well before its stock market debut in September. But a number of prominent hedge fund managers — Mr. Loeb of Third Point, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management and Mr. Bacon among them — pressed for one-on-one meetings with the company in the run-up to the I.P.O.

For instance, Jana disclosed that it also owned 842,268 shares of McDonald’s, a move that contributed to a 1 percent gain in McDonald’s shares. But while some hedge funds clustered around a few stocks, disagreement was common. The Fortress Investment Group, for example, disclosed owning five million shares in Ally Financial, the onetime financing arm of General Motors. Paulson sold two million Ally shares, disposing of its position. Mr. Loeb sold his position in Hertz. Hertz said on Friday that it would revise its recent financial statements after discovering errors.
