Constellation Brands, which brews Corona and Modelo beers and also makes Svedka vodka and Robert Mondavi wines, said that it was expanding capacity at its brewery in Mexico in an effort to increase its market share in the United States. Its second-quarter results include a $9 million charge resulting from a voluntary recall of defective bottles. Constellation said net income fell to $196 million, or 98 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Aug. 31, from $1.5 billion, or $7.74 per share, a year earlier. Excluding the charges, Constellation’s earnings were $1.11 per share.
