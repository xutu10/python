Rise in New-Home Sales Bolsters Outlook for U.S. Housing Market
Sales of new single-family homes surged in August to a six-year high, despite a backdrop of relatively high unemployment and sluggish wage growth.

WASHINGTON —  Sales of new single-family homes in the United States surged in August to their highest level in more than six years, a sign the housing recovery remains on course. The recovery, however, will probably remain gradual against a backdrop of relatively high unemployment and sluggish wage growth, two factors that are seen as sidelining younger first-time buyers. “This is welcome news in an otherwise mixed outlook,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. “We are still a long way from the housing market recovering from the bust.” New-home sales jumped 18 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504,000 units, a second straight monthly gain, which took them to the highest level since May 2008, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday. Though new-home sales account for only about 9 percent of the housing market, the increase helped allay fears of renewed weakness after a surprise decline in sales of existing homes last month. “We expect some of this buoyancy to be reversed in the coming month, but continue to believe that the underlying fundamentals of the housing sector remain favorable,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities. The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that sales of existing homes fell in August for the first time in four months as investors who had been supporting the market stepped away. Economists said they hoped the departure of the investors would leave an opening for first-time buyers, but they expressed concern that still-high unemployment and tepid wage growth would continue to constrain sales. The share of first-time buyers in the market for existing homes has been stuck around 29 percent, well below the 40 percent to 45 percent considered ideal by economists and by real estate agents. “It’s still a challenging environment for those buyers,” said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS. “You can make a good case for a slow, gradual improvement.” In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for loans to buy homes fell last week as mortgage rates crept up. New loan applications are well off peaks seen early last year. With average hourly earnings up only 2.1 percent over the past year, many Americans are choosing to rent, while some of those who have recently graduated from college are moving back home or staying with friends, factors that are weighing on home sales. According to government data released last week, 492,000 households were formed last year, well below the one million that economists say would be consistent with a healthy market. “Household formation, a major driver of new construction, is falling asleep at the wheel,” said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight. Despite the rise in sales in August, the stock of new houses on the market hit its highest level in four years, giving buyers more choice. At August’s sales pace it would take 4.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.6 months in July. A six-month supply is normally considered a healthy balance between supply and demand.
