In a sign that lower prices are starting to exact a toll on the oil industry, the offshore-rig owner Transocean announced it would take charges of more than $2.7 billion because of weakening demand for its rigs. Transocean said the charges forced it to delay its third-quarter earnings report, which was scheduled for Friday. Companies that explore for and produce oil are cutting back on investment because of sharp declines in the price of oil, which is reducing demand for rigs and lowering rates for Transocean’s equipment. Brent crude, the most common benchmark for global oil, has fallen 28 percent since late June.
