CHINESE STEALTH FIGHTER EXPECTED TO MAKE DEBUT China is expected to unveil its fifth-generation stealth fighter, the J-31, at this week’s Airshow China in Zhuhai, in Guangdong Province. As China’s domestic technology improves and manufacturing capability moves up the value chain, the country has emerged as a significant player in the global arms trade, which totaled at least $58 billion in 2012, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. CHRISTINA LARSON READINGS ON RETAIL SALES AND CONSUMER SENTIMENT On Friday, the Commerce Department will report the latest data on retail sales, for October. Analysts foresee a 0.2 percentage point rise in retail sales compared with the September. Also Friday, the preliminary Thomson Reuters University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment in November is to be released, with economists looking for a rise to 87.5, from 86.9 in October. The consumer sentiment index has been on the upswing recently, helped by lower gas prices, a surging stock market and a gradually falling unemployment rate. One year ago, in November 2013, in the aftermath of the government shutdown, consumer confidence stood at 75.1 in the University of Michigan survey. Wall Street will be watching both figures for clues to how the crucial holiday shopping season is shaping up, as well for signs of how much of an impact lower gas prices are having on consumer spending habits. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ DATA ON EUROZONE GROWTH COULD POINT TOWARD RECESSION The eurozone’s third-quarter economic growth figures are due out Friday and they could show that the region is indeed tipping toward its third recession in five years. Second-quarter growth was zero; if the third quarter follows suit — or if the figures show the economy actually contracted — alarm bells will ring. Even if the eurozone over all managed to record weak growth in the quarter, unease will grow if the German economy contracted. LIZ ALDERMAN
