New Initiative for Special Olympics Aims for More Spontaneity, Less Marketing
A campaign featuring a red ball concentrates on unity, and also serves as a lead-up to next year’s Special Olympics World Games.

A red ball is the star of a campaign for the  The campaign hopes to turn the red ball into a symbol of inclusion, acceptance and understanding. Ads in print and online, along with events and content in social media, present red balls in different sizes and shapes to reflect a variety of sports; the Special Olympics, based in Washington, is having actual red balls made to accompany the ones appearing in the ads. The campaign also seeks to raise awareness for a Special Olympics program known as  The campaign takes a bold, confident tone in seeking to stand out. One ad carries this headline, which appears above a red basketball: “Shatter intolerance. The backboard will follow.” There is a twist on that in the headline for a second ad, which promises, “Intolerance, prepare for an upset.” A third ad declares: “Changing the world is a contact sport. Game on.” A fourth ad asserts, “Odds were meant to be overcome.” And a fifth ad urges, “Let’s not wait for halftime to make a change.” The same tone is heard in the text of several print ads. “People with intellectual disabilities are excluded and discriminated against every day,” the text begins, then continues: “It’s time we team up and take to the field to challenge this. Together, as one, intolerance and injustice don’t stand a chance.” The text concludes this way: “Game on! Join the team at  The campaign is being introduced in the United States this week in timing that partly reflects the observance of National Bullying Prevention Month in October. Plans call for a rollout to countries that include Mexico, in November; Egypt, in December; Britain, Italy and Poland, in January; and China and South Africa, sometime in 2015. The ads will also serve as a lead-up to the  The campaign is being created by Y&R;, part of the Young & Rubicam Group division of WPP, which the Special Olympics  The campaign is largely pro bono, but there may be a budget for some aspects of it. Those involved in the campaign are also making plans to add television commercials to the media mix, possibly in the first or second quarter of next year. The campaign is another example of efforts by charitable organizations and cause marketers to find new ways to generate attention in a crowded and cluttered marketplace. For instance, the March of Dimes is using an image donated by the baby photographer Anne Geddes as the  In another example, a British charity called Magic Breakfast, which feeds children in elementary school, is teaming with the supermarket chain Tesco for  And of course there is the  “I don’t have ice bucket envy; I have ice bucket admiration,” says Timothy Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics, whose mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the organization. One lesson from the sudden and surprising success of the Ice Bucket Challenge is that “people want to participate,” says Mr. Shriver, who goes by Tim, rather than “give money to something that someone else is doing.” “The more democratic you make it,” he adds, “the easier it is to do it and the more people respond.” Another lesson from the ice-bucket fund-raising is that it worked because “it’s fun,” Mr. Shriver says. “It’s not a story about A.L.S. steeped in pity; it’s infused with happiness and fun.” “The lesson is that people can contribute to, be part of, something bigger by having a good time,” he adds. At Special Olympics, in trying to unite people through sports, which are by nature fun and participatory, “we put together two words that almost never go together, ‘fun’ and ‘important,’” Mr. Shriver says. And what follows, he adds, is “reshaping your internal calculations about difference and inclusion.” The organization searched for an agency about a year and a half ago, Mr. Shriver says, after determining that it would do better with “a sustained campaign globally” rather than “promoting events.” “We felt we had a larger narrative arc,” he adds, that was more than the Special Olympics being known just for putting on “‘a nice event for someone else’s children,’ to put it in a harsh tone.” The goal was to transform that into “an urgent moment for all of our children,” Mr. Shriver says. “We’d lost our edge.” David Sable, the global chief executive of Y&R; who led the agency’s team, “blew us away with his level of personal understanding of it,” he adds, and Y&R; began working on a brief that declared “go from event to movement, nice to urgent, ‘them’ to all of us, and engage people around the world.” The ball works for the Special Olympics because the organization is “more focused on the ‘human’ side” of human rights “than on the ‘rights,’” Mr. Shriver says. The goal of the campaign is “to build the first unified generation,” he adds, referring to “a generation that will end discrimination,” and to “empower young people to claim that mantle.” “It’s a little bit audacious,” Mr. Shriver acknowledges. “But what the hell; go big or go home.” “The marketplace of ideas is complex and competitive and crowded,” he added, and he hopes the red ball and the unified generation represent “a big enough idea, a welcoming enough idea to take in a lot of things: race issues, gender issues, people fighting bullying.” Over the years, the Special Olympics has worked with several leading Madison Avenue agencies, among them the Arnell Group and BBDO Worldwide. Those efforts were on a project basis. “We’re excited to be the first global agency of record for the Special Olympics,” says Britta Dahl, vice president and account managing director at Y&R; New York, and work to “create a renewed sense of importance and urgency, and bring in a new generation of young people on a global basis.” “Sports is the great unifier and offers an opportunity to bring people together,” she adds. “Together we can help change society and break down barriers of intolerance regarding how people with intellectual disabilities are treated.” Jim Elliott, chief creative officer of Y&R; New York, calls the millennial generation and their younger brothers and sisters “the perfect torch bearers for ‘Play Unified,’ for moving us forward.” “They’re such an open-minded, socially conscious group,” he says, and will be attracted to the concept of “playful rebellion against intolerance and indifference and exclusion” by “picking up a ball.” The goal is for this effort to be “less of a campaign, with a defined starting point and end point,” Mr. Elliott says, “and more of a movement.” The word “movement” is one that “gets used a lot in our business,” he adds, and his use of it brought up the Ice Bucket Challenge again. “We admire it a lot,” Mr. Elliott says. “Having participated in it myself, it’s one of those things you could never anticipate or orchestrate because it’s so organic. “It’s hard to predict what will take off, what will capture lightning in a bottle, but we have the right ingredients to ignite this generation,” he adds. “Our challenge is to do it in a way that feels organic and real, and not calculated.” “The goal will be” for millennials and the generation younger than they are “to own it,” Mr. Elliott says of the red ball and Unified Sports, “so it doesn’t feel like marketing.” If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that appears Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on
