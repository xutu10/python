Next year’s quota for Bluefin tuna off the United States, Canada and Mexico was raised by 14 percent to 2,000 metric tons by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, at the end of an eight-day meeting in the Italian port city of Genoa. The quota for the larger population of Mediterranean Bluefin tuna was raised by 20 percent to 15,821 metric tons next year, with additional 20 percent increases each of the following two years. The fisheries body’s scientific committee said “gradual and moderate” increases in the catch would not jeopardize the stock health. But the Pew Charitable Trusts said the tuna population “remains severely depleted.” Amanda Nickson, director of tuna conservation at Pew, said the new quotas appeared to reflect “a lack of political will to put in place responsible management for the medium- to long-term.”
