As Bond-Buying Ends, Yellen Now Will Chart Course for Federal Reserve
The Fed will next need to focus on the central bank’s power to set interest rates, but economic and strategic questions will shape their decisions.
===
WASHINGTON —  For Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve’s chairwoman, the easy part is over. The first phase of the Fed’s retreat from its economic stimulus campaign, plotted by her predecessor, is nearly complete. Now, as Ms. Yellen nears the end of her first year in office, it is her turn to chart the way forward. Ms. Yellen and her colleagues on the Fed’s policy-making committee, who will convene here on Tuesday and Wednesday, are broadly agreed that the Fed’s ability to improve economic conditions is nearing the end of the line, and they are inclined to start raising short-term interest rates around the midpoint of next year. But the group of 17 officials continues to grapple with a pair of questions, one economic and one strategic, that will determine the details of the retreat: How much better can the job market get? And given that uncertainty, does it make more sense to pull back sooner, even if that means leaving unemployment too high, or to keep rates anchored longer, pressing ahead until it is clear the economy no longer needs the Fed’s help, even if the result is an abrupt retreat? The Fed is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will add just $15 billion to its bond holdings in October. Then it plans to end the purchases, concluding a series of “quantitative easing” campaigns that have expanded its portfolio to $4.2 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities from less than $1 trillion before the 2008 crisis. That will let officials focus on the Fed’s central policy tool, the level of short-term interest rates, which have been fixed near zero since December 2008. The Fed has indicated it plans to hold interest rates near zero well into next year, to encourage businesses and consumers to borrow money and investors to take larger risks. But the internal debate has shifted in recent months as job growth has increased to a monthly average of 215,000 jobs so far this year, a level that some of the Fed’s economic research has suggested is about as strong as it is likely to get. Fed officials who support the campaign have stopped pushing to extend its duration, while moderates are warning that the Fed may need to beat an earlier retreat. “Fed rhetoric has turned marginally more hawkish in recent months,” Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in an analysis last week. He said he now expected the Fed to start raising rates in June 2015 rather than the third quarter. Economists at Bank of America made a similar shift. “There has been a gradual change in rhetoric from Janet Yellen and her allies,” their report said, though it added that the projection was “more of a guess than a forecast.” Ms. Yellen has made clear since taking office that she is deeply concerned about the persistence of high unemployment, and that she continues to regard the Fed’s stimulus campaign as an effective response. In her first public speech after taking the helm of the Fed, in March, she  “We’re doing everything we can,” they said that she told them. But the next day, when Ms. Yellen delivered a professorial survey of the many unanswered questions about labor markets, some analysts saw evidence that she, too, had growing doubts about how much more the Fed could do. Ms. Yellen is also a low-key leader who speaks regularly with her colleagues in a constant search for common ground. Like Ben. S. Bernanke, her predecessor — but unlike some previous, more autocratic Fed chairmen — she lets other officials speak first at policy meetings, preferring to summarize the discussion rather than speaking at the outset to set the frame of the debate. But Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, noted that Mr. Bernanke, despite his preference for consensus, proved willing to act forcefully, as in September 2011 when the Fed expanded its stimulus campaign despite three dissenting votes. “I think it’s going to be very collegial, and what we’ve seen so far is consistent with that, but nevertheless there are things she’s going to feel more strongly about,” Mr. Hatzius said. Many investors also are skeptical that the Fed intends to move faster. Asset prices that incorporate expectations about interest rates generally reflect an expectation that rates will rise more slowly than the predictions Fed officials made in June. This may reflect greater pessimism about the economic outlook. It also reflects a view that the projections are misleading. An average of the predictions obscures the reality that the Fed’s leadership, including Ms. Yellen, is more supportive of stimulus. “Some dots are more equal than other dots, and it so happens that the more powerful dots skew dovish,” Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at the Philadelphia brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott, wrote recently to clients. In addition to the economic argument for moving sooner, some Fed officials see a strategic argument. John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, has argued in research papers that central banks should deal with uncertainty by doing less — which in this case means an earlier retreat. “I think a gradual approach and learning as you go in terms of seeing how the economy responds is appropriate, given this uncertainty,” Mr. Williams said in a recent interview. “Maybe backing away from this rather than running away.” Some officials argue that the Fed should begin to open up its options by adjusting the language of its July policy statement, which said that the central bank did not intend to raise interest rates for a “considerable time” after ending bond purchases, a phrase widely understood to mean at least six months. While the Fed is expected to stick with that language at least for this week’s meeting, there is growing discomfort with the phrase because officials do not want to exclude the possibility they will move sooner. “Any reference to calendar dates has the potential to be inaccurate,” Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in a speech this month. Mr. Rosengren remains among the strongest proponents of the Fed’s stimulus campaign, so it was particularly striking that he said the Fed was now close enough to achieving its goals that a time commitment no longer made sense. Better to emphasize that the timing will depend on inherently unpredictable economic conditions, he said. And as the Fed makes that shift, either now or in the coming months, a period of unusual clarity about Fed policy will come to an end. It’s time to pay attention again.
