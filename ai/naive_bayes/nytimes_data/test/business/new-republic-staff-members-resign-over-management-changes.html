New Republic Staff Members Resign Over Management Changes
The action by more than two dozen workers was prompted by anger over an abrupt change of editors, former staff members said.

More than two dozen members of the staff of The New Republic, including several contributing editors, resigned on Friday morning, angered by an abrupt change of editors and what they saw as a series of management missteps. The resignations include the senior editors Alec MacGillis, Julia Ioffe and Isaac Chotiner, and the contributing editors Sean Wilentz and William Deresiewicz, according to several staff members who are leaving.  The departures, which represent a significant chunk of the small magazine’s staff,  Mr. Foer was replaced with Gabriel Snyder, the former editor of The Atlantic Wire. “I am saddened by the loss of such great talent, many of whom have played an important role in making The New Republic so successful in the past," The New Republic’s owner, Chris Hughes, said in a statement on Friday. “It has been a privilege to work with them, and I wish them only the best. This is a time of transition, but I am excited to work with our team — both new and old alike — as we pave a new way forward. The singular importance of The New Republic as an institution can and will be preserved, because it’s bigger than any one of us.” Mr. Hughes, a founder of Facebook, had recently hired a new chief executive, Guy Vidra, against the wishes of Mr. Foer. The appointment caused a clash between the more literary tradition of The New Republic and the business approach of Silicon Valley that was more familiar to Mr. Vidra, who was hired from Yahoo. In a memo Thursday, Mr. Vidra said he wanted to reimagine the publication “as a vertically integrated digital media company.” “This was not about blind loyalty to Frank and this was not about Gabe,” one member of staff said about the resignations, speaking only on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the matter. “This was about management and how they handled things every step of the way.” A staff meeting, called by Mr. Vidra and scheduled for 10 a.m. Friday, was pushed back after the resignations were announced.
