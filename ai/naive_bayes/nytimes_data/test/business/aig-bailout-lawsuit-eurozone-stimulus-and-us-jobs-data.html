LAWSUIT OVER  Six years after the government rescued the American International Group from the brink of collapse, one of the insurance company’s largest shareholders is getting his day in court this week, claiming the bailout cheated investors and violated the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Maurice R. Greenberg, the 89-year-old former chief executive of A.I.G. and still a large shareholder, is seeking more than $40 billion from the government, accusing it of creating an overly onerous bailout. The trial, which opens Monday in the United States Court of Federal Claims in Washington, is expected to last about six weeks.  EUROPE HOLDS HEARINGS ON COMMISSION NOMINEES The  MEETING ON EUROPE’S ONLINE REGULATION Leaders from some of the world’s largest telecom and digital companies, like Vodafone and Netflix, will meet in Brussels on Wednesday. They will discuss a new wave of regulation, including tougher online privacy rules, that is expected to come into force across Europe next year.  STIMULUS PLANS FOR EUROZONE The  SEPTEMBER EMPLOYMENT FIGURES On Friday, the Labor Department will report the latest figures on unemployment and job creation in September. According to estimates from economists, employers added around 213,000 jobs in September, up from 142,000 in August. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 6.1 percent. The consensus also calls for a rise of average hourly earnings in August of 0.2 percent, another important indicator of economic health.
