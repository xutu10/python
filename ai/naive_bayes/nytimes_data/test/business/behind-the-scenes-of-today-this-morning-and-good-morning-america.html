The Early Shift: Behind the Scenes of ‘Today,’ ‘This Morning’ and ‘Good Morning America’

In the dark hours of the morning, some of television’s biggest celebrities are already rolling out into the streets of the city that never sleeps. Cars arrive at network headquarters in Midtown Manhattan in the predawn silence, and the day begins for Matt Lauer of the “Today” show, Robin Roberts of “Good Morning America,” Charlie Rose of CBS’s “This Morning” and their colleagues. There is little fanfare. The shows are enormously important, though; they attract huge audiences and generate tens of millions of dollars in revenue. George Stephanopoulos of “G.M.A.” gets up each day at 2:15 — and meditates. Savannah Guthrie, who says she likes to do her most intense preparation for “Today” in the wee hours before broadcast, is up about 3 a.m. Mr. Lauer and most of the anchors set their alarms for about 4, three hours before they will face the viewers. Mr. Lauer says he prefers to prepare extensively the night before. Each host follows certain rituals. Lara Spencer of “G.M.A.” stops each morning at Dunkin’ Donuts for an egg-white sandwich. Mr. Stephanopoulos eats an apple at the end of every broadcast, and throws the core in the same trash bin. Gayle King walks into the CBS studio on West 57th Street and gives the crew the same greeting: “All in our places, bright shiny faces!” The members of the morning casts move comfortably around one another, in the makeup room and then in the studio, and take their places just a few minutes before the theme music plays and the red light comes on.
