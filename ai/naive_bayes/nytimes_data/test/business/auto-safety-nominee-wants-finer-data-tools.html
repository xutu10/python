Auto Safety Nominee Wants Finer Data Tools 
Mark Rosekind, nominated to run the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, testified before a mostly friendly Senate Commerce Committee.

WASHINGTON —  President Obama’s choice to lead the nation’s top auto safety agency told a Senate committee on Wednesday that the agency, long criticized for failing to spot defects in cars, now faces so many consumer complaints that it has trouble keeping up. “We’re not even talking about connecting the dots, we’re just talking about the overload of having that many,” said Mark R. Rosekind, at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee. The number of annual complaints made to the  But Dr. Rosekind added that the problem was not just the number of data analysts, and he pointed to other industries that may offer innovative ways to interpret the data. For example, he said that aerospace and  Dr. Rosekind’s nomination comes at a time of uncertainty and turmoil at the agency, which has been without a permanent leader for nearly a year. The safety agency faces an internal review of its operations by the Transportation Department, its parent agency, as well as an investigation by that department’s inspector general. At the same time, the auto industry has increasingly become engulfed in a safety crisis, spurred by revelations that General Motors failed for more than a decade to a disclose a dangerous defect in millions of older cars that it has now linked to 36 deaths. More than 50 million vehicles — a record number — have been recalled in the United States this year. Dr. Rosekind, a psychologist who is a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which analyzes accidents and makes recommendations, received a mostly friendly response from both Democrats and Republicans. But several lawmakers took the opportunity to urge Dr. Rosekind, if he is confirmed, to take a harder line with automakers and their suppliers. “These companies are way more afraid of a civil lawsuit than they are of N.H.T.S.A,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who presided over the hearing. “I think it’s really important that you keep that at the top of your list in terms of priorities. If you are not feared and respected, then you cannot do a good job.” She added, “I don’t think N.H.T.S.A. is either feared or respected at this point.” She pointed to the refusal of the Takata Corporation, an airbag manufacturer, to expand a recall that has been limited to certain geographic areas to the rest of the nation, despite the urgings of the safety agency. While there was no apparent opposition to Dr. Rosekind’s nomination, it was not clear whether the Senate would act before the session ends. But the ranking Republican member of the committee, John Thune of South Dakota, reiterated his criticism of the White House for leaving the post vacant for so long. The highway safety agency’s last permanent administrator, David L. Strickland, a former Senate committee staff member, quit nearly a year ago to take a job with a Washington law firm, part of a flow of government officials  When Mr. Strickland left, in January,  Dr. Rosekind’s opening statement mostly discussed auto safety, which has been the subject of multiple congressional hearings. He told the committee that safety was “a very personal priority for me since my earliest days,” because his father, a San Francisco police officer, was killed in the line of duty by a driver who ran a red light. “Through this single and profound event in my own life, I share in the individual and personal stories of so many people who have been affected by preventable tragedy on our roadways,” he said. Dr. Rosekind has been one of the five members of the National Transportation Safety Board since June 2010. Before that, he had his own consulting company, Alertness Solutions, for 12 years, and before that, he was the director of the fatigue countermeasures program at NASA’s Ames Research Center. A psychologist trained at Stanford and Yale, he completed a two-year postdoctoral fellowship program in sleep and chronobiology at Brown University’s Alpert Medical School. One issue frequently confronting the National Transportation Safety Board, and on which Dr. Rosekind has often shown expertise in public hearings, is how automatic systems can present information to a human operator. With the approach of automotive collision-warning systems and even self-driving cars, N.H.T.S.A. will face those issues, too. Already it is trying to position itself  The N.T.S.B. is an independent agency, with no regulatory authority, and Dr. Rosekind had no administrative responsibilities. The agency that Dr. Rosekind has been nominated to head, which has an annual budget of about $800 million, sets various standards for cars and highways.
