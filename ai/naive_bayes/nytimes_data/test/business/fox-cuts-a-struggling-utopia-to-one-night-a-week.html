Fox Cuts a Struggling ‘Utopia’ to One Night a Week
The network said on Wednesday that it would drop one of the two weekly episodes of the reality series, sticking only with an hour on Friday.

Count this as the first half-cancellation of the television season: Fox announced Wednesday that it would drop one of the two weekly episodes of its flopping reality series “Utopia,” sticking only with an hour on Friday. The Tuesday edition of “Utopia” will be axed starting next week. Eventually Fox will try another reality series, “Masterchef Junior,” about child cooks, on Tuesdays at 8. But that will not start until Nov. 4. In the interim, Fox will fill the hour with repeats of its animated shows, before it starts its World Series coverage on Oct. 21. “Utopia,” a social experiment show featuring a group of participants thrown together to try to “build a new society,” has been a ratings disaster from the start. The network plowed a huge amount of money into it — reports have put the expense as high as $50 million — but it has performed far worse in the ratings than the singing competition “The X-Factor,” which Fox canceled after last fall. The move is a shift in Fox’s original plan to cut “Utopia” down to once a week after the first six weeks of the season, leaving Tuesday as the one night. Making it Friday instead — a day when most shows are very low rated — amounts to sending the show into premature exile.
