Regulator Slow to Respond to Deadly Vehicle Defects
An investigation by The New York Times has found that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration frequently has been slow to identify problems, tentative to act and reluctant to employ its full legal powers against companies.

General Motors published an  Its 2014 Chevys had earned more five-star overall safety ratings in a new car assessment program than had any other brand. The next day, G.M. began recalling millions of its cars for a deadly ignition defect, and by August, six of the eight five-star Chevrolet models had been recalled for a variety of safety issues, including defects in air bags, brakes and steering. Five had been recalled multiple times. It was an embarrassing turn — but not just for the embattled automaker. The stellar rankings had been awarded by the federal regulatory agency that is mandated by Congress to ensure the safety of automobiles. The agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, has a record of missteps that goes well beyond its failure to detect an ignition switch defect in several models of G.M. cars now linked to at least  An investigation by The New York Times into the agency’s handling of major safety defects over the past decade found that it frequently has been slow to identify problems, tentative to act and reluctant to employ its full legal powers against companies. The Times analyzed agency correspondence, regulatory documents and public databases and interviewed congressional and executive branch investigators, former agency employees and auto safety experts. It found that in many of the major vehicle safety issues of recent years — including unintended acceleration in Toyotas, fires in Jeep fuel tanks and air bag ruptures in Hondas, as well as the G.M. ignition defect — the agency did not take a leading role until well after the problems had reached a crisis level, safety advocates had sounded alarms and motorists were injured or died. Not only does the agency spend about as much money rating new cars — a favorite marketing tool for automakers — as it does investigating potentially deadly manufacturing defects, but it also has been so deferential to automakers that it made a key question it poses about fatal accidents optional — a policy it is only now changing after inquiries from The Times. Jean Bookout was injured, and her passenger, Barbara Schwarz, was killed in 2007 when the 2005 Toyota Camry Ms. Bookout was driving in Oklahoma suddenly accelerated through an intersection and hit an embankment. When the safety agency inquired about the cause of the accident in 2010, the Japanese automaker replied, “Toyota understands that this request is optional and respectfully declines to respond at this time.” Three years later, Toyota paid $3 million in compensatory damages after having been found guilty in a lawsuit the two women’s families brought against the company. And in March, a federal judge  By the time General Motors began recalling cars this year for ignition defects that could cause stalling, the agency had logged more than 2,000 complaints about the issue in the recalled models, some from consumers who had picked up on patterns in the agency’s database that its own investigators missed or did not look for. After Chrysler balked last year at the regulator’s suggested 2.7 million vehicle recall for exploding fuel tanks in its Jeeps, the federal agency scaled back its request by 1.1 million cars. It also agreed to Chrysler’s demand that the automaker not be required to say the vehicles had a safety defect or that the automaker was at fault. The agency has linked 51 deaths and at least two serious injuries to the defect over 14 years. And four years ago, the agency cut short an investigation into rupturing air bags in Honda vehicles, saying there was “insufficient information” to suggest that the companies had failed to take timely action. Since then, more than 13 million more cars have been recalled by Honda and 10 other automakers for the rupture risk, and Honda has linked two deaths to the defect. The agency declined to make regulators available for interviews, agreeing only to reply to written questions. “N.H.T.S.A. has a proven record of aggressively investigating and pursuing recalls,” the agency wrote. It added: “N.H.T.S.A. evaluates each potential safety defect issue based on the particular circumstances involved and does not have a set threshold for opening defect investigations beyond our core mission of reducing fatalities and injuries from motor vehicle crashes.” The agency, created in 1970, is part of the Transportation Department and has an annual budget of about $800 million, which is split among vehicle safety, highway safety research and grants geared toward promoting traffic safety at the state level. While traffic fatalities have fallen considerably since its creation in part because of safety improvements in vehicles, the agency has a history of falling short of expectations in policing automakers and fulfilling its investigations mission. In the late 1990s, it was sharply criticized by lawmakers and consumer advocates for failing to detect a pattern of highway rollovers in Ford Explorers with Firestone tires that was eventually tied to 271 fatalities. Congress passed a law in 2000 that was meant to give the agency more leverage over the auto industry and better access to its accident data. Yet since then, the agency has continued to show sluggishness in its investigations, feeding a perception that it does not stand up to the politically influential, multibillion-dollar automobile industry until it is forced to do so by outside pressure. In a year that has included the deadly ignition scandal at G.M., the billion-dollar Toyota criminal settlement and an ever-expanding number of air bag recalls, some consumer safety advocates are hopeful that the record number of recalls will spur the agency to step up its vigilance. This year automakers have recalled more than 48 million vehicles in the United States, surpassing the previous record of about 30 million in 2004. Safety experts continue to push for a more transparent approach from the agency, including better documenting its internal reviews of safety concerns. On Tuesday, the Senate subcommittee that questioned G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, in two charged hearings on the ignition switch defect will turn its focus to the safety agency. The session comes as the Transportation Department’s inspector general is conducting an audit of the agency’s handing of the G.M. switch issue, an inquiry that people familiar with the effort say has been widened to look at how effectively the agency carries out its mission beyond the G.M. case. A primary focus of the inquiry, these people said, is the so-called pre-investigation phase of the agency’s work — when the engineers and other specialists in its Office of Defects Investigation decide whether to proceed with a full investigation of a possible safety defect. “N.H.T.S.A. is a very critical agency,” said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that represents state highway safety departments and administers grants from N.H.T.S.A., and whose chairman has been called to testify at the Senate hearing. “I think it’s struggling.” Spotting Problems The Times reviewed more than 12,000 consumer complaints to the federal agency about power, speed and ignition problems in the G.M. models recalled for ignition-related problems. The first stalling complaints arrived in 1997, and starting in May 2000, the agency consistently told drivers that there was insufficient evidence to open an investigation, even when drivers presented similar complaints that they had found on the Internet and on the agency’s own website. The analysis by The Times found that before the recalls the agency had received more than 5,000 complaints about the ignition problems, including more than 2,000 about unexpected stalling, in the models G.M. eventually recalled for an ignition defect that could lead to stalling. As recently as a month before the recalls began, the safety agency was dismissing complaints from drivers about such problems. In January the agency responded to a driver of a 2010 Chevrolet Impala, who had been on the road to Tuscaloosa, Ala., when the car’s power cut out. The driver had found similar complaints of sudden stalling and passed them along, urging the agency to examine the problem. A division chief wrote back that, based on a review of its database, there was “insufficient evidence to warrant opening a safety defect investigation.” By the time the Impala was  Years earlier, Stephanie Rogers of South Lyon, Mich., had written to the agency in October 2007 cataloging a number of complaints that she had seen on the Internet about cars stalling while moving. “This is an extremely dangerous problem, and since I am not the only one dealing with this issue I am wondering why no letters are being sent,” she wrote. Bruce Spinney, who worked at the agency from 1970 to 2008, specializing in the cost impact of new safety features, said he did not understand why the agency had not reacted sooner to the ignition problems. “The consumers seem to be divining these patterns before the regulators,” he said. As of this month, G.M. has recalled nearly 16.5 million vehicles for ignition-related problems, including 2.6 million for the defective switch that the automaker acknowledges it knew about for years. In almost all of the ignition recalls, the problem could result in moving cars suddenly shutting off, disabling air bags and other key systems like power steering and power brakes. David J. Friedman, the acting N.H.T.S.A. administrator, has said in public forums that data presented by G.M. this year would have most likely changed the regulator’s approach to the issue had the information been available earlier. The new data directly linked the ignition switch problem to the nondeployment of air bags, which in many accidents had been the only clue that something was amiss. But a review of the agency’s complaints records shows that at least one G.M. driver, Jessica Cruickshank, offered evidence from an OnStar diagnostic test that showed a potential link between the engine cutting out and air bag failure — only to be rebuffed. During the summer of 2005, it was pitch black on an interstate highway in rural West Virginia when Ms. Cruickshank’s car shut off and she had to wrestle the wheel to bring it to the side of the road. Trucks whizzed by in the dark, and her 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix shook as they did. In the back seat of the car, her youngest daughter began to cry. “You can see how a child would be frightened,” Ms. Cruickshank said in an interview. “I was afraid, too.” That was the last time she drove the car. It had already been cutting out more than once a week, she said. Her family hired a lawyer, who wrote to the safety agency in August 2005 to alert it to the stalling problem. Ms. Cruickshank was not injured, and no impact occurred to set off the air bags. But the lawyer informed the agency that a diagnostic test run by OnStar, a subsidiary of G.M., indicated that there was a “distinct probability that the air bags would either not deploy or misfire in the event of a front-impact collision.” A month later, regulators replied that a review of their database “revealed insufficient evidence to warrant opening a safety defect investigation.” In that instance, even G.M. seemed to recognize something was not right: A few weeks later, the company bought back the car. Answer Optional To give N.H.T.S.A. more muscle, Congress passed a law in 2000 requiring automakers to report to the safety agency any claims they received blaming defects for serious injuries or deaths. But the safety agency has allowed automakers to conceal important information in that reporting process by not requiring full disclosures when confronted with follow-up questions. In the agency’s so-called death inquiries — requests for further information from automakers — it has made optional a key question: What may have caused the accident? The Times reviewed nearly 100 death inquiries obtained under the Freedom of Information Act — including all inquiries made of General Motors, Chrysler and Ford in one quarter of 2012 — and found only four cases in which a manufacturer responded to the question, and none in which a defect in the vehicle was identified. Some of Ford’s responses reviewed by The Times were particularly blunt, including one regarding an August 2011 fatal accident in which a passenger in a 2007 Ford E-350 van was inexplicably ejected through a passenger window though the vehicle had sustained only minor damages. The claim asserted a defect involving a “nonfixed window” or the grade of glass. N.H.T.S.A. FORD: Joan Claybrook was the head of the agency from 1977 to 1981, well before the law was passed that instituted the death inquiries. “It should not be an optional question,” she said of the follow-up request to identify the cause of an accident. “You need to show you are serious about enforcement and be tough as nails with the manufacturers.” General Motors chose not to answer inquiries regarding at least three of the 13 fatal crashes that the automaker has linked to its ignition switch defect. In one of those cases — the death of a 25-year-old Texas man — G.M. responded that it  In interviews with former and current employees of the agency, no one was able to explain why the question had been made optional. The agency declined to answer queries from The Times about the death inquiries for more than a month. Late Friday, when informed of the deadline for this article, the agency submitted a written reply. “All inquiries now require manufacturers to provide this information,” the statement said. Late and Limited Data on the agency’s website indicates that 33 investigations from the 1990s remain open. “The agency is dedicated to ensuring that current safety defect issues affecting the driving public today are addressed, and is dedicating its resources to this priority, rather than to closing old cases that did not find an unreasonable risk to safety,” N.H.T.S.A. wrote in response to a question about the open cases. But on at least one such current issue, N.H.T.S.A. had stood on the sidelines for years. Now that defect, involving air bags made by the Japanese supplier Takata, has mushroomed into one of the biggest recalls in history. A recent Times article  Complaints filed with the agency as far back as 2000 allude to rupturing air bags in models carrying Takata air bags, but the first recall did not come until eight years later, and it was relatively tiny. In November 2008, Honda recalled 4,205 cars over possible air bag explosions. Six months later, after a teenager was killed in her Accord by shrapnel from an exploding air bag, the company recalled more than 510,000 additional cars. The two recalls prompted the agency to open an investigation in 2009 into the two companies’ handling of the defect, during which the safety agency asked why Honda and Takata had initially recalled so few cars, according to filings at the time. Six months later it closed the investigation, a timetable so swift that it appears to have taken even Takata by surprise. The company had been in the process of fulfilling the agency’s request for more documents, a Takata lawyer wrote in an email dated May 19, 2010, when it received notice that the investigation was now closed. The lawyer called to say that he had located the documents and asked if the agency still needed them. “You told me that such a submission would not be required at this time,” Kenneth N. Weinstein, the lawyer representing Takata, wrote in the email to the agency’s Office of Defects Investigation. “I confirm this is accurate,” responded an agency official, Jennifer Timian, the principal investigator on the case. In the document officially closing the investigation, the agency wrote that there was “insufficient information to suggest that Honda failed to make timely defect decisions on information it was provided.” The closing statement concluded, “there are no additional vehicles to be investigated.” Less than a year later, further cases of rupturing air bags prompted Honda to resume its recalls. Other companies soon followed. The current total of cars under recall for the problem is 14 million. N.H.T.S.A. began a second investigation in June. Resources and Powers Part of the safety agency’s problem in dealing with investigations is surely resources, or at least how they are allocated, former employees said. The agency’s budget for safety defects investigation has hovered around 1 percent of its total budget for each of the last 6 years, even as funding for other divisions such as its ratings program has gained a larger share. The $10.6 million total budgeted for this year is less than the $14.4 million total compensation package that G.M.’s chief executive, Ms. Barra, stands to earn in 2014. After the so-called Tread Act was enacted in 2000, requiring the agency to analyze fatal crash data and other additional information, the defects office added more staff, growing to 63 employees at one point in 2001. Today it has 51, a decrease that reflects retirements and attrition, N.H.T.S.A. said. In its written reply to questions from The Times, the agency said it had asked Congress for six additional staff positions for defects investigation and compliance in fiscal year 2015. How effectively the office uses its staff is one issue of concern to Calvin L. Scovel III, the inspector general of the Transportation Department. He said in a written statement to The Times that N.H.T.S.A. had yet to fulfill a recommendation from an  Some former staff members emphasized that the dysfunction within N.H.T.S.A.’s defects unit stemmed not only from limited funding and staffing but also from a lack of cohesion and a culture of secrecy. “It’s always been organized as a silo, without the normal checks and balances that exist in the regulatory process,” said Bill Walsh, a senior associate administrator at the agency until 2004 who helped to put into effect the agency’s current complaints system. The agency has also not made full use of its legal powers in investigating automakers, which include an ability to force the recall of vehicles and to issue subpoenas to obtain information and documents. In congressional testimony this spring, Mr. Friedman, the agency’s acting head,  Asked by The Times how many subpoenas the agency had issued over the past 10 years, the agency did not offer a direct reply. The agency “routinely issues information requests and special orders” under federal law “to demand information and documents from auto manufacturers and automotive equipment suppliers,” it said. It has been 35 years since the regulator has invoked its legal authority to order a company to recall cars. The agency said it had “forced manufacturers of vehicles and equipment to conduct thousands of recalls” since 1979 without needing to invoke its powers. By “pressuring” manufacturers to conduct the recalls voluntarily, the agency said, consumers benefit because the recalls occur more quickly. “We will continue to hold manufacturers accountable for the timely identification and reporting of defect and noncompliance issues regarding their products,” the agency said. In one recent case, the agency threatened to flex its statutory muscles but in the end backed down. In June 2013 the agency asked Chrysler to conduct a recall of about 2.7 million Jeep Grand Cherokees and Jeep Liberties because of the gas tank problem. If the automaker did not comply, the agency said, it would publish a public notice describing the defects, its investigation into the matter and the scheduling of a public meeting. After the public meeting, N.H.T.S.A. could have legally forced a recall. But the agency  After first refusing to recall the vehicles, Chrysler’s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, spoke with David L. Strickland, who led the agency at the time, and agreed to recall 1.6 million vehicles, according to a person briefed on the conversation. They agreed to install a trailer hitch that would offer more protection in the event of rear-end accidents. It also would be far less costly to Chrysler than more extensive remedies. As for the remaining 1.1 million vehicles, Chrysler said it would send a notice to dealers, instead of a conducting a recall, which is a far less serious approach to a safety issue. The agency — which looked into the issue only after an outside advocacy group, the Center for Auto Safety, made a formal request — agreed to Mr. Marchionne’s demand that it stop describing the vehicles as defective. Top Marks The Chevrolets under recall this year that received the agency’s five-star rating for safety were far from the only models earning top marks in N.H.T.S.A.’s ratings program. The program dates to 1978 and is supposed to provide consumers with information about the crash protection and rollover safety of new vehicles. In its current form, the agency awards up to five stars to vehicles based on various safety measures. For automakers, a high rating can serve as a powerful government seal of approval. An analysis by The Times of the individual ratings since 2001, which were obtained from the car-shopping and research site Edmunds.com, shows that almost every model attained high marks. For models from 2001 to 2010, 87 percent of all the safety ratings awarded through the program were four or five stars. John O’Dell, a senior editor and vehicle safety expert at Edmunds.com, said that automakers had over the years become savvy to N.H.T.S.A.’s requirements and learned to design their cars to do well in the ratings. For example, the agency tests for a vehicle’s ability to withstand a rollover accident, something that automakers have focused on improving. But in 2011, the agency said it introduced new standards to make it tougher to score high and added an overall safety rating. “The program raised the safety bar by implementing more stringent crash tests, making it harder for vehicles to achieve the top ratings of five stars,” the agency noted in a request for increased funding for the ratings program. Yet the ratings have edged even higher since then, The Times found. For models from 2011 to the present, 92 percent of the overall safety ratings were four or five-star ratings, according to the analysis. The percentage of four and five-star overall ratings increased each year, from 83 percent for 2011 models to 96 percent for 2015 models. “It’s a waste of a valuable government resource,” said Jack Gillis, a N.H.T.S.A. official in the 1970s and 1980s who was involved in early efforts to develop a ratings program at the agency and now publishes an independent rating. “The government would have the opportunity to dramatically stimulate competition if they were to present this information on a more relative basis.” Asked about the preponderance of top grades, the agency said they were proof its program was effective in bringing about safety changes. It pointed to the industry’s embrace of the ratings. “Automakers routinely use our star information in their advertising,” the agency wrote in an email. “Safety sells.”
