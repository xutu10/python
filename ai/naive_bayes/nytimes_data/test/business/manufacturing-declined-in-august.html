WASHINGTON —  Manufacturing output fell for the first time in seven months in August, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a steadily expanding factory sector. That view was bolstered by other data on Monday that showed factory activity in New York State jumped to its highest level in nearly five years in September. “The weakness in factory output in August is likely to be transitory,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. Factory production  Excluding automobiles, manufacturing output gained 0.1 percent in August. So far in the third quarter, factory production is running at a 4.6 percent annual pace for growth, a sign that manufacturing will continue to support economic growth. Motor vehicle output declined 7.6 percent last month after a 9.3 percent jump in July. Economists attributed the surge in July to difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations after some automakers kept assembly lines running instead of closing plants for the traditional summer retooling. With auto sales at their highest point in an eight and a half years, motor vehicle production is expected to rebound. In a separate report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its  A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region’s factory activity. A gauge of new orders rose last month and inventories continued to shrink, keeping the balance between orders and inventories favorable. “If we can be persuaded to look though the volatility of the official data, it’s evident that the U.S. economy has continued to grow strongly in the third quarter,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at the financial data firm Markit. Third-quarter growth estimates range as high as a 3.5 percent annual pace. The economy expanded at a 4.2 percent in the second quarter. With the economic data, including retail sales and housing, continuing to be upbeat, some analysts say that could encourage the Fed’s policy makers to look toward raising interest rates earlier than expected next year when they meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. “Investors will have to start getting used to the reality that the Fed is going to raise interest rates, most likely during the first half of next year,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. The Fed’s report showed that mining output increased 0.5 percent in August, while utilities production rebounded 1.0 percent. The amount of manufacturing capacity in use fell to 77.2 percent last month from 77.6 percent in July, while overall industrial capacity use hit a six-month low of 78.8 percent.
