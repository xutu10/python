SolarCity Joins Rivals in Lending to Clients
Customers in eight states will be able to buy solar systems with monthly payments based on how much electricity the systems produce.

Over the last few years, SolarCity has helped solar panels spread across residential rooftops by lending customers the energy equipment in exchange for monthly electricity payments that were lower than their normal bills, often with no money down. Now the company, which has grown into the nation’s largest rooftop solar installer, is planning to lend customers something different: money to buy the systems outright. Starting on Wednesday, the fast-growing company will offer customers in eight states loans to buy home solar systems, with monthly payments based on how much electricity the systems produce. “The motivation of the company and the customer are aligned,” said Lyndon Rive, SolarCity’s chief executive. “We are highly motivated to make sure the system is always performing at its maximum capacity.” The company is joining several of its competitors, who have already begun offering loans, said Shayle Kann, a vice president at GTM Research, which tracks clean-tech industries. Those include Sungevity, Clean Power Finance and Mosaic, the online peer-to-peer lending platform that recently began allowing homeowners to finance their systems. Leasing has been a big factor behind the increase in rooftop solar installations in recent years — growing to 66 percent of the market in 2013 from 40 percent in 2011, Mr. Kann said. But that proportion would probably peak next year, he said, and then slowly drop as loans gain steam. Still, he said it was unlikely to cause a great shift in the market because the same customer base eligible for leases would be eligible for loans. “Probably there’s some group of customers who will find a loan more appealing and comprehensible,” he said, “but I think at the end of the day it’s just another tool in the toolbox for SolarCity and a tool that many of the other companies in SolarCity’s business are finding valuable.” As that toolbox fills, however, customers will have more factors to compare among providers, as with other major purchases, including the length of the loan and whether the rates escalate, he said. Mosaic’s loans, for instance, start at 4.99 percent, a company spokeswoman said, but are offered over 20 years, while SolarCity’s can carry a lower interest rate — 4.5 percent — but have payments over 30 years. The SolarCity loan, called MyPower, is unusual in that its repayment is based not only on the overall value of the system but also on how much electricity it produces, so it is calculated in kilowatt-hours and varies each month, Mr. Rive said. Although the total repayment amount will stay constant, if the system produces more than anticipated over the life of the loan, the customer will be able to pay it off faster. SolarCity plans to start out with the loans in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey but, with 52 operations centers in 15 states, expects to expand. In many places, the loan, offered to customers with high  By the middle of next year, Mr. Rive said, he expects that half of the company’s sales volume will come through lending for ownership rather than through leases and power purchase agreements, known as P.P.A.s. “People love the P.P.A., but they want to own systems,” he said. “If you don’t have a tax liability, then the P.P.A. is a better product.” Otherwise, he said, “Why would you not take this one?”
