Strong Sales and Rising Consumer Sentiment Bode Well for Holiday Shopping

WASHINGTON — Retailers in the United States reported strong sales in October, a sign that American consumers were spending with more gusto and could help keep the economy growing at a brisk pace. Other data on Friday showed consumer sentiment rising to a seven-year high this month, also positive for the spending outlook as the country nears its traditional period of frenzied holiday shopping. Retail sales, which account for about one-third of consumer spending, rose 0.3 percent in October, the Commerce Department said. The gain was larger than analysts expected, and would have been higher but for a 1.5 percent drop in receipts at gasoline retailers. The “numbers bode well for the crucial holiday shopping season,” said Paul Diggle, an economist at Capital Economics in London. Sales rose broadly in October among retailers, from purveyors of clothing to sporting goods shops. Sales climbed 0.5 percent in an important reading that strips out volatile elements like gasoline, autos, building materials and food services. Separately, the Commerce Department reported on Friday that businesses in the United States added to their stockpiles at a faster rate in September. Business inventories rose 0.3 percent in September, after a 0.1 percent rise in August. The August increase was the weakest showing in more than a year. The inventories report showed that stockpiles held by wholesalers were up 0.6 percent in September, and manufacturers’ inventories rose 0.1 percent. Merchandise held by retailers fell by 0.2 percent. When companies add goods to their stockpiles, it typically reflects optimism about future demand. Reductions in inventory restocking can be a sign of concern about future sales. A rise in inventories at a time of falling sales can be a sign of involuntary inventory building. The gains in retail spending in October, though, support the view that American consumers are ready to play a bigger role in supporting the recent acceleration in national economic growth. Analysts expect the economy will expand about 3 percent next year, faster than the average growth rates clocked since the 2007-9 recession. Other data showed that the falling unemployment rate and lower gasoline prices lifted a preliminary November reading of the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index to 89.4, the highest since July 2007. Separately, Labor Department data that showed import prices fell 1.3 percent in September, as cheaper oil and a strong dollar made it less expensive for Americans to buy goods from abroad. While the American economy has accelerated in recent months, the global economy has appeared to slow, including in China, and the price of oil has weakened significantly. This is a boon for shoppers in the United States. “Consumers are spending what they are saving at the gas pump,” said Camilla Sutton, a currency strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.
