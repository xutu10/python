Night Two of television premiere week continued the success stories for NBC and CBS, while bringing some disappointment for both ABC and Fox. CBS dominated on Tuesday night in terms of reaching the most viewers, while NBC dominated among the ones many advertisers pay a premium to reach — those between the ages of 18 and 49. CBS’s latest spinoff effort, “NCIS: New Orleans,” rode the coattails of the long-running original “NCIS” to the biggest audience thus far for a new series, with 17.1 million viewers. NBC, meanwhile, claimed every half-hour among younger viewers, with “The Voice” again posting four straight half-hours of increasing ratings in the 18-to-49 group. The show averaged a 4 rating over all, which was even better than Monday’s 3.9. The total audience for the show was 13 million, up from 12.9 million on Monday. That strength carried over to NBC’s 10 p.m. drama, “Chicago Fire,” which matched its best 18-to-49 rating ever, a 2.7. Its total audience was 9.4 million. On CBS, the “NCIS” original took in the night’s biggest audience, with 18 million, and second-best rating in the 18-to-49 category with a 2.9. CBS’s 10 p.m. drama, “Person of Interest,” fell off, however, to just a 1.8 rating in that category, though again it averaged the most viewers in the hour, 10.7 million. For ABC, the troublesome number came at 9 p.m., from its second-year drama “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” The show was down 60 percent from last year’s much-hyped premiere, though it matched the lower level at which it finished the season, a 1.9, among the 18-to-49 viewers. The drama averaged only about 5.5 million viewers, about a third of the totals watching CBS and NBC in the hour. The 10 p.m. hour was somewhat better as the new ABC drama “Forever” posted the same numbers as it had in its Monday night premiere, indicating it was not rejected by those who saw it. The Fox network was noncompetitive the whole night. No show on the network had more than 2.3 million viewers. Its expensive, ambitious new reality show “Utopia,” which struggled to find viewers even before new shows arrived to compete against it, could not even manage a 1 rating in the 18-to-49 group and averaged under two million viewers over all. It stands out as the leading contender for the first show canceled this season — or would if Fox did not have so much invested in it in both money and hours on its schedule. The rest of the Fox lineup did little better. At 9 p.m. the onetime hit comedy “New Girl,” getting no help from “Utopia,” continued its deep slide, reaching just a 1.3 rating in the 18-to-49 category and only 2.3 million viewers. Still, that was robust compared with the numbers for its comedy partner at 9:30, “The Mindy Project.” The show, which has been a critical favorite thanks to its popular star, Mindy Kaling, eked out a 1 rating in the 18-to-49 category with just 2.1 million total viewers. As all the networks are doing, Fox is urging patience because its shows' audiences will grow when delayed viewing is added later. But even under its own best-case projections, “Utopia” does not get above a 1.2 rating and “Mindy” a 1.6.
