The company said the changes would help unify its response to the mounting recalls and speed up decision-making. The Takata board voted to replace Stefan Stocker, who became president last year. He is a Swiss national who joined Takata from the privately held supplier Robert Bosch. The management reshuffle, though, is unlikely to affect Takata’s response to the crisis. Mr. Takada, who preceded Mr. Stocker as president, never gave up the title of chief executive and has issued the company’s public statements on the recalls so far. Neither executive has made a public appearance since a shareholders’ meeting in June, prompting criticism over the company’s response. Mr. Stocker, hired to oversee Takata’s fast-growing global operations, has largely taken a back seat as the recall crisis mounted. He will remain with the company as a board member, Takata said. Mr. Takada will take a 50 percent pay cut for four months to take responsibility for the airbag recalls, the company said in a separate statement. Mr. Stocker and three other senior executives will also take pay cut for four months, the company said.
