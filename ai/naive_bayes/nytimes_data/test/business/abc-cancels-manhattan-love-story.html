ABC Cancels ‘Manhattan Love Story’
The sitcom is the fall TV season’s first casualty.
===
It took a bit longer than usual, but the television season has its first ejection: ABC has canceled the low-rated new sitcom “Manhattan Love Story.” The network made the move late Friday, when bad news is typically issued. The comedy scored poor ratings for its premiere, and those figures dropped lower in the four subsequent episodes. The most recent episode attracted fewer than three million viewers. Networks have been waiting longer to pull the cancellation lever because they want to see if a horde of viewers recorded the show for later viewing. “Manhattan Love Story” was not reaching a significant number of additional viewers. The sitcom, about a young couple finding romance in New York, included inner monologues that revealed what they were truly thinking. It was part of a wave of romantic comedies that have proliferated on the networks in recent seasons. Few of them have succeeded.
