G.M. Plans New Version of Its Volt for 2015
Hoping to revive lagging sales of the Volt, the company said the new version will store more energy in its battery pack and go further on a charge.

DETROIT —   Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief, said on Tuesday that the new version of the Volt, which will have better fuel economy and driving range, is evidence of the automaker’s long-term commitment to  “It will store more energy in its battery pack, yet go further on a charge,” Ms. Barra said in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club. “It will accelerate faster, and the car’s generator will come from an all-new G.M. engine family and use even less fuel.” G.M. will also concentrate more of its production of Volt components in Michigan, where it assembles the vehicle Besides continuing to make the car’s battery pack in the state, the company will move production of an electric-drive system from Mexico to a transmission plant in suburban Detroit, and produce its new gasoline engine in Flint. The Volt is assembled at G.M.’s last assembly plant in Detroit, Hamtramck. Ms. Barra added that G.M. would invest an additional $300 million in Michigan to support its vehicle electrification projects. “We must provide the breakthrough technology the customers want,” she said. Volt sales have dropped 13 percent in the United States in the first nine months of this year, lagging G.M.’s overall 4 percent sales improvement. By contrast, sales of the all-electric Nissan Leaf have soared 35 percent. G.M. did not provide details on fuel-economy and other improvements planned for the Volt, which has struggled to find buyers partly because cheap gasoline has made conventional cars more attractive to consumers. The current version of the Volt gets between 35 and 40 miles of pure-electric driving range on a single battery charge. When its gas engine provides the power, it has an estimated fuel economy of 35 miles per gallon in city driving. The Volt news is the latest effort by G.M. to draw attention to its products, and away from the safety crisis it has faced this year. Since acknowledging this year that it had failed to fix defective cars for more than a decade, G.M. has issued recalls covering about 30 million vehicles. But Ms. Barra said the frequency of recalls had dropped, mostly because G.M. had reorganized its engineering operations, added more investigators and encouraged workers to report safety problems to top management. “We have very good sensing mechanisms in place,” she said. “I think you’ve seen a change already.”
