Alastair Mitchell, on Running With Your Dreams
A chief executive describes what he calls the “big red bus test”: If a bus were about to run you over, he asks, what would be the one thing you’d regret not doing?

This interview with  Q. What were some early influences for you? A. I learned a lot as a kid from my grandfather, who was an entrepreneur in construction. The Internet is considered the miracle thing now, but back in the ’50s and ’60s, concrete was one of the miracle things. He built concrete bridges, and all his sons went into the business. And he took the company public. I remember being 5 or 6 years old and he gave me shares in the company. I just thought that was very cool and very inspiring. What did you study in college? I studied engineering — designing ships and boats. Engineering is a great multilateral kind of training ground, because you learn math, science, coding, technology and business. It’s a full spectrum, and you learn to connect a whole bunch of things. You also meet interesting people designing boats and ships. Your classmates are either the sons of great shipping magnates who have come to learn the family business, or they’re America’s Cup sailors. I’ve got a bunch of very interesting friends. And after college? I did two dot-com start-ups coming out of college — one was at the height of the bubble, just before everything crashed — and I learned the importance of timing and luck. Then I worked for an established company, where I learned what works well. What were some early management lessons for you? I made the classic young-manager mistake of hiring somebody just like you, because you feel comfortable. They called one person I hired “Ali Light” and “Mini-Me.” I also learned all the lessons about being too vague or not strong enough or clear enough when you’re giving feedback. I had to learn how to empower people — knowing when to let them take risks and when not to criticize them too hard if things go wrong. You have to back them up and then say, “That didn’t work, so how are we going to improve it next time?” You can lose that sense of empowerment quickly as companies grow. I find myself constantly reinforcing the message with my teams. I’ll say: “Look, what do you guys think? Forget what you were told. What do you think about this particular question or problem?” You have to build command structures, which are very important for focus when you’re scaling. But you have to give people a sense of mission and a clear scope of what we do and don’t do and then allow people to be as entrepreneurial as they like within those guidelines. Did you always want to start your own company? Yes. One of the guiding principles in my life — and everyone I know gets very bored hearing me talk about it — is what I call the big red bus. It comes from London, where they have big red buses, and it’s basically about the fear of death. It sounds very morbid, but the message is very positive. The idea is to think about what would happen if I were to walk out across from your building and cross the street, and a big red bus is coming the other way and I don’t see it. But I turn around and then it literally hits me and knocks me dead. In that brief moment before it hits me, what would be the thing that I would regret not doing? What is that burning thing inside of you that often eats at people at night? Whenever I’m faced with difficult decisions, I always apply the big red bus test. Instinctively, people know the right answer, but it can be buried under so many layers of doubt and questions. Starting my own business came from one of those moments. I just decided one day that we’re going to do this. It was at the height of everything going well for me in my job at the time. I even walked away from quite a big payout. How do you hire? If you’re sitting in front of me, it’s likely you’ve got the experience, so the interview is really to find out whether you’ve got the cultural makeup to fit into the organization. I look for people who think big, who are motivated and who have the entrepreneurial instinct. In my questioning, I’m looking for almost the rough edges — the things on their résumé that look different or reveal an inner drive. After the honeymoon phase, there’s always going to be a trough, and you need people who can work through those tough periods. I’ve had a couple of instances where I’ve asked questions that turned out to be too raw and I’ve touched on something that revealed someone’s inner passion. I’ve had people who have been in tears, or they were banging on the table about something they really care about. That’s when you know you’ve got someone. Those moments can also reveal how they’re going to act under pressure, and either you like what you see or you don’t. The questions I use to find the rough edges are things like: “What is the toughest thing you’ve ever done?” “What are you most proud of in your life?” “What’s an example of something that’s gone really badly for you?” I’ll also pick one thing on their résumé and really drill into why that was successful. One big problem I’ve seen in interviewing is that the résumé can look great, but it turns out that they were just the right person at the right time with a great product. What career advice would you give to college students? I’d say go big or go home. And just trust yourself. Whatever your gut instinct is, you’ll probably be right seven or eight times out of 10. So just go with your gut. What you’ll regret more is the fact that you haven’t gone with your gut. We’re here for only a very short time, so why not try to build something great?
