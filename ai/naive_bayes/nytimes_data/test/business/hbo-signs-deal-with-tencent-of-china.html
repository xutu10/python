HBO Signs Deal With Tencent of China
Tencent, which is big in social networking and gaming, gains exclusive rights to stream HBO shows online in China, where they will be subject to government approval.

BEIJING — The Chinese Internet company Tencent Holdings said Tuesday that it had made a deal with  Tencent, a leader in China for social networking and gaming, will be the exclusive online provider in the country of series like “Game of Thrones” — which features gore, nudity and incest — “True Detective” and “Boardwalk Empire,” the company said. “This partnership enables us to distribute some of the most groundbreaking programming in the world through our robust technology platform, to the benefit of Chinese Internet users,” Martin Lau, the president of Tencent, said in a statement. But even as China’s Internet TV companies have pumped more than $1 billion into foreign content in less than two years to attract more viewers, government regulators have stepped up their oversight of the previously freewheeling industry. This includes ordering TV shows to be taken down, excising “obscene” or “pornographic” material and imposing limits on how much foreign content can be shown on any video site. The crackdown is partly seen as a move to protect the still-developing domestic TV and film industry from outside competition. Tencent declined to say how much it spent on HBO’s content. The TV series and films are set to be shown in the very near future, said Tencent, but they are still subject to approval from Chinese regulators and may need to be censored. Earlier this year, the state broadcaster CCTV showed a censored version of “Game of Thrones.” In May, China’s authorities ordered streaming services to take down the popular American shows “The Big Bang Theory,” “The Good Wife,” “NCIS” and “The Practice.” Tencent’s competitors include Sohu.com; Youku Tudou, which is backed by the e-commerce titan Alibaba and the smartphone maker Xiaomi; and iQiyi, which is affiliated with the search giant Baidu and also part-owned by Xiaomi.
