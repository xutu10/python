CBS Mr. Corden, a British comedian who will be a new face to virtually the entire American audience, is succeeding Craig Ferguson, who is ending his 10-year run on the late-night show Dec. 19. To the extent Mr. Corden is known in America, it most likely is for winning the Tony Award for his performance in the play “One Man, Two Guvnors.” CBS will fill the roughly two-month period before Mr. Corden’s arrival with guest hosts. The network also announced that Mr. Corden would have a fellow Briton, Ben Winston, as his executive producer. Mr. Winston currently serves as executive producer of the British version of “The X Factor.”
