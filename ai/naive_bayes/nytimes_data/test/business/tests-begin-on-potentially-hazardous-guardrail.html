Tests Begin on Potentially Hazardous Guardrail

WASHINGTON —  Federal and state transportation officials gathered on Wednesday at the first day of crash testing for a possibly hazardous guardrail system. More than 30 states have banned the guardrail, the ET-Plus made by  The initial testing, set to unfold over several weeks in San Antonio, will replicate new-to-market tests done nearly a decade ago, when the product was introduced. Critics, including lawmakers and lawyers for accident victims, say the tests will not determine whether the ET-Plus is safe. They have pushed for stricter crash tests that address the system’s known vulnerabilities. Tony Furst, the Federal Highway Administration’s associate administrator for safety, said on Wednesday that the testing was only “one step of many,” not necessarily devised to test for the safety defect. Mr. Furst said the agency’s goal was first to “re-baseline the device” by ensuring the original tests were conducted properly. The agency may subsequently order more specific testing. Federal officials have also begun analyzing episodes involving the ET-Plus from around the country, including accident records. Wednesday’s first test involved crashing a pickup into an ET-Plus at a 15-degree angle, and was delayed for more than three hours for unspecified reasons. Many accident victims have struck the guardrail from shallower angles. Mr. Furst said that no definitive results would be released until a set of eight crashes, expected to be completed in January, had been analyzed. However, he told reporters on Wednesday that from his vantage point the crash “looked like it passed,” though he could not be sure. Jeff Eller, a spokesman for Trinity, said it was unfair for critics to insist that the ET-Plus be tested under standards released in 2011 because the system had been “designed, manufactured and tested pursuant to” an older standard. Also present on Wednesday were state officials, including from Virginia and California, as well as an observer from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, which helps set standards for highway equipment. The testing will continue with a second crash on Thursday.
