Popular ‘Eat This, Not That!’ Brand to Start Quarterly Magazine
The brand that began a decade ago as a column in Men’s Health magazine and expanded into a popular book series, will add a quarterly magazine, available on newsstands Tuesday.

It may seem that print versions of magazines and newspapers are vanishing from newsstands with few prospects in the pipeline to replace them. But one publisher is betting that some holiday shoppers still will want to give the gift of print. The  Meredith is starting the magazine because it reached an agreement this fall with David Zinczenko, the former editor in chief of Men’s Health, who began writing the column in 2004. Mr. Zinczenko left Rodale, which owns Men’s Health, in 2012 and started Galvanized, which advises other companies on magazines and books, like American Media’s reintroduction of Men’s Fitness Magazine. At the same time, Mr. Zinczenko was trying to buy the Eat This, Not That! brand, which had grown into a 16-book franchise, from Rodale. He said in a telephone interview that he bought the franchise in September, and that Meredith was one of the first companies he met with about developing a magazine. Having a magazine is compelling for readers and advertisers because it includes so much content about what is found in grocery stores. “It’s literally about what products to buy,” Mr. Zinczenko said. “We think there will be a lot of consumer demand for this.” Tom Harty, president of Meredith’s National Media Group, said he felt confident starting a new print magazine because the company was building on a powerful franchise and it fit well with Meredith’s magazine portfolio, which includes Fitness, Eating Well and Better Homes and Gardens. He also noted that there seemed to be an appetite for more expensive and higher-quality magazines, often called bookazines, for which readers will pay a premium. With Eat This, Not That!, Mr. Zinczenko brought Meredith an established brand. Other such brands have recently driven the successful introductions of HGTV magazine and the Food Network magazine. “Obviously, this is not a new brand,” Mr. Harty said. “It’s established.” “I don’t believe there’s any risk associated with doing something like this,” he said. “It’s only upside.”
