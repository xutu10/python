Taylor Swift’s ‘1989’ Carries High Hopes but No Country Music
The music industry eagerly awaits the first-week sales of Taylor Swift’s new album, “1989,” as CD sales continue to slump, and Ms. Swift moves farther away from country music.

One of the few certainties in the music business these days is that if  Her last two records, “Red” and “Speak Now,” each sold more than one million copies in its first week out, an increasingly rare feat as music sales weaken, and listening habits shift to online streaming services like Spotify and YouTube. Two years ago, “Red” started with 1.2 million sales, the  But the fate of Ms. Swift’s newest release, “1989,” which comes out Monday, has been the subject of nervous speculation in the industry for months, given not only the poor sales climate over all but also Ms. Swift’s decision to break from country radio, a vital source of support since the beginning of her career. This year, no new title has cracked the one-million sales mark — a crucial symbolic milestone — and album sales over all are down 14 percent from the same period last year. According to Billboard magazine, “1989” is projected to sell at least 800,000 copies in its debut week. In August, Ms. Swift, who was born in 1989, announced the release of “1989” through a fan gathering at the  It was the culmination of a long transition in her music toward pop and came as little surprise to her fans or the industry at large. But the break with country was definitive. The first single, “Shake It Off,” was a hit on Top 40 radio and went straight to No. 1, yet it was largely ignored by country programmers. While Ms. Swift’s record company, Big Machine, had sent country stations special remixes of some of her earlier pop-leaning songs, no such effort was made with “Shake It Off.” “A lot of folks wished that she would have done some songs that would be more compatible with country radio, but she hasn’t,” said Joel Raab, a longtime consultant to country radio stations. In the small world that is the Nashville music business, little outright negativity about Ms. Swift has been voiced publicly. A more prevailing sentiment is wistful pride. “Taylor is one of us, one of our children,” said Mark Razz, the music director at WXTU-FM, a country station in Philadelphia. “You’re there for them along the way, and then they need to go to what they are going to do. She’s gotten to where she is through country music, and if she goes on to be the next pop sensation around the world, we are behind her 100 percent.” Less support from country stations — now the  The biggest hurdle for the success of “1989” may simply be the slumping world of music retail, with downloads now joining CDs as a declining format. Spotify and other streaming services, while growing in popularity, are not tracked in the same way as sales, and so far, the revenue those outlets generate has not made up for the drop in the number of albums sold. Even if “1989” sells only 800,000 copies in its first week, that would more than double the next-biggest showing of the year, when Coldplay sold 383,000 copies of “Ghost Stories” in May. Big albums are expected later this year by One Direction, Lil Wayne and Kendrick Lamar, but Ms. Swift’s release is expected to be the most popular by far. “It’s just very difficult to convince people to buy music,” said Keith Caulfield, an associate director of charts at Billboard. But if anyone can exceed expectations, Mr. Caulfield said, it is Ms. Swift. “Forecasts are forecasts,” he added. “The weather changes.”
