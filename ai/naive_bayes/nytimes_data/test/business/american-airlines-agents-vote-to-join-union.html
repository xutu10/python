American Airlines Agents Vote to Join Union
About 86 percent of customer service employees at the merged American Airlines-US Airways voted in favor of union representation.

Customer service agents for the merged American Airlines and US Airways have voted overwhelmingly in favor of union representation, the National Mediation Board announced Tuesday. The agents, who number about 14,500, will be represented by the Communications Workers of America or, in some cases, the Teamsters. While the US Airways agents were previously unionized, the far larger group of American agents were not. The workers include those operating check-in counters and boarding gates — the first airline employees whom passengers deal with at the airport — as well as reservation agents. About 86 percent of those voting elected to join, with 9,640 agents in favor and 1,547 against. The vote was conducted over four weeks, electronically or by telephone. The result was particularly important for the nearly 9,000 service agents from the former American Airlines, where unionization efforts had been going on for 19 years. The effort was renewed after the merger, with organizers citing federal rules that permit such a vote after a fundamental change in company structure. The two airlines closed their merger last year but still operate as separate carriers. They are currently working to unify operations and integrate the work groups. The parent company, American Airlines Group, aims to get its single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration by the middle of next year and complete the merger of its reservation systems by the end of 2015. The Communications Workers of America last sought to organize American’s agents two years ago after forcing the carrier to hold an election after a lengthy court battle. The union lost that bid by about 150 votes out of nearly 6,000 cast. US Airways agents have been members of the union since 2000. Workers from America West, which merged with US Airways in 2005, have been organized with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters since 2004. Those workers will continue to be represented by the Teamsters, and the others by the Communications Workers. Three-quarters of the agents for the combined airlines work in Texas, North Carolina, Florida or Arizona, the Communications Workers of America said. Union leaders said the organizational efforts were focused on American’s biggest hubs in the South, including Dallas/Fort Worth, where the airline is based, and Florida. In February, the United Automobile Workers suffered a big loss in its push to expand in the South when Volkswagen workers  “This is a big deal because this is the South,” said Larry Cohen, president of the Communications Workers of America. The vote comes as unions continue to achieve significant footholds among airline workers who were previously not represented. The industry is emerging from a decade of bankruptcies and consolidations, when managers emphasized cuts to costs, salaries and benefits. With rising profitability across the business, the new impetus behind union representation could translate into demands for better wages for workers, and higher costs for the airlines. In August, Virgin America flight attendants voted in favor of union representation by the Transport Workers Union of America. The vote was the first time a work group at the airline had voted to unionize. The union got 58 percent of the votes. Pilots at JetBlue Airways, after twice rejecting unions since 2009,
