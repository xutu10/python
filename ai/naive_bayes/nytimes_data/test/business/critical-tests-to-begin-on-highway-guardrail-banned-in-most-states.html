Critical Tests to Begin on Highway Guardrail Banned in Most States

WASHINGTON —  In crash tests that will be closely watched by transportation regulators around the country, the future of a possibly hazardous highway guardrail will begin to take shape Wednesday in San Antonio. More than 30 states have banned the guardrail system, the ET-Plus made by Trinity Industries, and the company has halted sales pending the outcome of the tests. Federal officials estimate 200,000 of the guardrails have been installed nationwide. The Federal Highway Administration asked for the new crash tests after a federal jury found Trinity liable for defrauding the government by not disclosing design changes to the system. Some regulators contend the Trinity guardrails are too dangerous to remain on the road over the several months the testing and analysis could take. Officials in Nashville identified at least 20 ET-Plus units and replaced one of them this week, with plans to replace them all. Jenna Smith, a spokeswoman for the Nashville Public Works Department, said officials “feel this is the safest measure to take in light of concerns” with the Trinity device. Replacing each ET-Plus will cost Nashville about $6,000, and Ms. Smith said the department would put the units that are removed in storage pending a determination of their safety. Yet the new crash tests, selected and planned by Trinity, will essentially replicate the standard, new-to-market tests done nearly a decade ago when the modified ET-Plus system was released. Federal officials have not required the company to follow testing guidelines that were updated in 2011, or to modify the tests to better replicate the accidents that result in injuries. That has prompted criticism from lawmakers and lawyers for the victims, who say that simply allowing Trinity to rerun an old set of tests will not determine whether the product is safe. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote a blistering letter to the Federal Highway Administration last month, calling the testing proposal “far too deferential to Trinity,” and demanding that the company be required to use updated safety requirements. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, also called for using the updated standards, which, for example, require crash tests to be done at a shallow angle more representative of most accidents. The Federal Highway Administration said that because it deemed the ET-Plus eligible for federal funding in 2005, it qualified to be tested under older guidelines. In a statement, the agency said it had “not ruled out additional testing” and was “aggressively pursuing all sources of existing data on the in-service performance of the ET-Plus.” The agency said it was “pursuing additional analyses whether or not the device passes the crash tests,” but would have to “analyze this data before making a determination regarding the need for any additional testing.” Guardrail systems work by collapsing when hit from the front, absorbing the impact and pushing the rail itself out of a vehicle’s path. The rail head or end terminal, often marked with yellow and black stripes, is supposed to slide to accomplish this. But Trinity’s redesign of its ET-Plus narrowed the channel behind the head, which can cause it to jam, state officials have said. When that happens, instead of being pushed aside, the metal rail can enter the vehicle like a spear, killing or injuring those inside. The testing scheduled to begin Wednesday will be conducted by the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. Officials from the Federal Highway Administration and several state departments of transportation will be present. Federal officials have deferred to Trinity on whether independent monitoring would be permitted. Initially, the company said no public access would be allowed. On Monday, Trinity changed course and said it would let two members of the news media observe, but that no cameras, audio recording devices or even cellphones would be allowed.
