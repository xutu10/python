John Carter, 86, Is Dead; Led Women’s Magazines 
Mr. Carter is believed to be the only person to edit all of the so-called Big Three women’s magazines: McCall’s, Ladies’ Home Journal and Good Housekeeping.

John Mack Carter, a Kentucky-born journalist who had the singular distinction of editing all of the so-called Big Three women’s magazines and, in doing so, helped transform the genre during the feminist era, died on Friday at his home in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 86. The cause was Parkinson’s disease, his wife, Sharlyn Carter, said. Mr. Carter edited McCall’s from 1961 to 1965, Ladies’ Home Journal from 1965 to 1974 and Good Housekeeping from 1975 to 1994. He is believed to be the only person to edit all three. Mr. Carter was already a veteran editor of women’s magazines when, in March 1970, more than 100 feminists led by  The protesters wanted Mr. Carter to resign and be replaced by a woman. They demanded that the magazine run a “liberated” issue. And they called for the magazine to offer services friendly to women, like day care. Mr. Carter said he planned to keep his job but was willing to negotiate on the rest of their concerns. In the August issue, the magazine included an eight-page insert written by 30 of the protesters tackling topics like childbirth, divorce and feminist consciousness-raising. In a note to readers about the contributors, however, Mr. Carter cautioned that the editors “do not agree with many of the assumptions their arguments rest on.” Mr. Carter was no stranger to adding pithier, topical content to women’s magazines. In 1961, at the age of 33, he became editor in chief of McCall’s and immediately began updating it, replacing what he characterized as stories about virtuous women with reported articles about housing costs, medical insurance and other subjects affecting women. “Women’s magazines were badly behind the times,” he told The New York Times in an interview in 1963. “They were using baby talk to communicate with their readers. They were failing to keep up with the rising educational levels in this country.” Still, on reflection in his later years, after he had become outspoken on issues like sexual harassment and job discrimination, he acknowledged that the turning point in his thinking did not come until the sit-in at Ladies’ Home Journal. “There was more discrimination than I thought,” Hearst quoted him as saying in a biographical sketch. “I didn’t push our women readers far enough in their awareness.” John Mack Carter was born on Feb. 28, 1928, in Murray, Ky. His journalism career began in high school, when he worked part time for a tiny local paper. But after receiving bachelor’s and master’s degrees in journalism from the University of Missouri, the latter in 1949, he joined Better Homes & Gardens because, he said, the pay was so much better than what newspapers offered. Except for a short stint as a commissioned naval officer during the Korean War, he remained with women’s magazines for the rest of his career, never officially retiring, his family said. Under his leadership as editor in chief, Good Housekeeping, a Hearst publication, won two National Magazine Awards in the Personal Service category, in 1989 and 1993. He is also credited with starting the now-common practice among women’s magazines of putting celebrities on the cover. “The idea was revolutionary at the time, and massive, immediate circulation growth followed,” Frank A. Bennack Jr., a former chief executive of Hearst, said in the company’s biography of Mr. Carter. Mr. Carter was so well regarded as a moneymaker that he was eventually put in charge of Hearst Magazine Enterprises, an entrepreneurial branch of the company. Over the years, he had a hand in creating many Hearst titles, including SmartMoney (a joint venture with Dow Jones), Marie Claire and Country Living. Mr. Carter was inducted into the  He was also one of the first male members of the Association for Women in Communications. In addition to his wife of 66 years, the former Sharlyn Reaves, Mr. Carter is survived by a daughter, Jonna Carter; a son, John Mack Carter II; his twin sister, Carolyn Carter Reagan; and four grandchildren.
