SEOUL, South Korea —  Samsung Electronics reported on Thursday that its July-September quarterly profit fell to the lowest level in more than three years, as a decline in earnings from its smartphone business put the South Korean giant on track for its worst year since 2011. The company, the global leader in smartphones, has lost market share in annual terms for the last two quarters, lagging Apple in the premium market and overtaken by rivals like Lenovo and Xiaomi at the bottom end. Samsung said its third-quarter operating profit fell by 60.1 percent from a year earlier, to 4.1 trillion won ($3.9 billion), matching its guidance issued this month and signifying the weakest result since the second quarter of 2011. Looking to the fourth quarter, Samsung said it “cautiously expects an earnings increase, driven by strong seasonal demand for TVs and continued growth momentum for the memory business.” But it said the mobile division’s outlook remained uncertain. Analysts expect Samsung to record its weakest annual operating profit in three years, despite the introduction of devices like the Galaxy Note 4. A Thomson Reuters survey of 41 analysts estimated Samsung’s 2014 profit at 26.4 trillion won, down from last year’s record 36.8 trillion won. Profit for Samsung’s mobile division fell to 1.75 trillion won in the third quarter from 6.70 trillion won a year earlier, its worst performance since the second quarter of 2011. Samsung spent most of the quarter without introducing a new flagship device and continued to struggle in the mid- to low-tier markets. While the introduction of Galaxy Note 4 in September and the expected release of new products in the low end of the market during the October-December quarter are expected to lift smartphone sales slightly, analysts say the days of record mobile profits for Samsung are over.
