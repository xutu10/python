More Jobless File Claims, but Hopes Stay Strong
The number of applications for unemployment benefits rose 17,000 last week, but an economist said the numbers were still a reason to be optimistic about growth.

WASHINGTON —  More Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, but the number of applications continued to be low enough to suggest that solid growth will continue. The Labor Department said on Wednesday that the number of applications for unemployment benefits rose 17,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 298,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose 250, to 290,750. That average has fallen 17.5 percent in the last 12 months. “The claims data still point to relatively upbeat conditions in the labor market,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, noting that the weekly figures routinely rise and fall. Applications are a proxy for layoffs. For almost four months, the number of applications for jobless benefits has been less than 300,000, a level that suggests that employers expect strong economic growth to continue. The growing signs of a strengthening economy appeared to help nudge a few would-be home buyers. The  The Realtors group estimates that 2014 sales will end up below 2013 levels. It forecasts that 4.94 million existing homes will be sold in 2014, down 3 percent from 5.09 million in 2013. Analysts say sales of about 5.5 million existing homes a year are common in a healthy real estate market. Hopes are higher for the new year. In 2015, the group expects sales of existing homes to rise to 5.3 million. Buying could also be helped by average 30-year mortgage rates that are staying close to a 19-month low. Rates nationwide averaged 3.87 percent this week, according to the mortgage company Freddie Mac.
