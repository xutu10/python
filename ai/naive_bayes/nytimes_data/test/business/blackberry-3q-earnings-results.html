BlackBerry Narrows Loss in Quarter, but Revenue Declines
The company reported a drop in third-quarter revenue to $793 million, despite the introduction of a heavily publicized phone.

OTTAWA —  The company reported revenue of $793 million during the three months ending in November. That was down from $1.1 billion in the period a year earlier. And despite the introduction of a heavily publicized phone, revenue declined from the $916 million the company posted during its previous quarter. BlackBerry said it lost $148 million, or 28 cents a share, during the quarter, compared with a loss of $207 million, or 39 cents a share, in the second quarter. In the period a year earlier, BlackBerry recorded a loss of $4.4 billion, or $8.37 a share, which led to concerns about its viability as well as a management reshuffling that resulted in the appointment of John S. Chen as president and chief executive. The company said that much of the third quarter’s loss came from a $150 million re-evaluation of some of its debt. The company also had restructuring charges of $5 million in the period. The company said that consumers and businesses bought 1.9 million of its phones in the three-month period. By comparison, Apple sold about 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets in the first three days after their introduction in September.
