In Fast-Food Workers’ Fight for $15 an Hour, a Strong Voice in Terrance Wise
Leading the latest one-day strike, Mr. Wise, who for years has had low-paying fast-food jobs, is at the forefront of a growing movement.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Most mornings last year, Terrance Wise left home before his three daughters woke up, to head to his $9.30-an-hour job at Burger King. And after working his second job of the day, as a $7.47-an-hour cook for Pizza Hut, he returned home 16 hours later, around 11 p.m., after his daughters had gone to sleep. “The kids started saying, ‘Daddy, we never get to see you,' ” said Mr. Wise, 35. The situation worsened when Burger King cut back his hours and his fiancée was sidelined from work with a back injury. Despite his working two jobs, he and his family were evicted from their apartment, leaving them homeless for three months. His financial struggles while working in low-paying fast-food jobs since the age of 16 help to explain — not surprisingly to many friends and colleagues — why he has emerged as the leading voice of a nationwide movement of fast-food workers clamoring for a higher wage. Two years after 200 fast-food workers walked out in a one-day strike in New York City, the walkouts have spread across the country and become the largest labor protests in the nation in years. On Thursday, when the  “I have never seen a movement like this,” said Mr. Wise, in his crisp tenor voice. “We’ve seen how the civil rights movement won civil rights and we’ve seen how women won the right to vote. Those things weren’t given to us. People faced hoses and beatings. “Some people even died. We have to bring the same pressure for today’s times and make the companies listen to us. We have to do whatever it takes to win.” Often speaking with the cadence of a preacher, Mr. Wise has inspired friends and co-workers. Some of them say his appearances on NPR or “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC remind them of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He traces his speaking style to a time when, as a precocious young golfer in Columbia, S.C., he was invited into the  He spent his childhood in public housing, with his mother earning so little as a Hardee’s restaurant cashier that she sometimes could not pay the electricity bill. “We never owned a house, we never owned a car, we had to take our clothes to the laundry in a shopping cart,” Mr. Wise said. “It was really a bad neighborhood — they said the way out was to play sports or sell drugs.” While he played golf and basketball and was an honors track student who won prizes for public speaking, his two brothers went to prison for selling drugs. Even then, Mr. Wise held two jobs — at KFC and Wendy’s — during high school. He wound up dropping out because he couldn’t juggle school with a work schedule that often ended at 2 a.m. The pay for fast-food jobs was bad then and still is, he said. “What we’re asking for is realistic. We took in $1,200 the other day at lunch hour at my Burger King. The six workers there cost them $60 or so for that hour. So I see they can pay us $15,” Mr. Wise said. As leader of the Fight for 15 campaign, Mr. Wise is sometimes a calming presence, sometimes an inspiring activist, rarely hesitating to rail against fast-food companies. When the movement needed an emissary to address the N.A.A.C.P.'s national convention to persuade the group to endorse a higher wage, it sent Mr. Wise, who is not paid for his work for the movement. When 1,200 members of the movement gathered in July for a convention, Mr. Wise led a crucial segment that rallied votes behind a risky plan to commit civil disobedience. And last week, Mr. Wise oversaw a nationwide conference call in which workers, gathered at meetings in 50 cities, loudly approved plans for Thursday’s strike — the eighth in a wave of one-day strikes and protests. “My kids are living in poverty, it’s hard getting just the basic necessities, and they truly are the reason I fight,” Mr. Wise told the workers in the conference call. “It makes me angry, and you should be angry, that these billion-dollar corporations are robbing from my kids and your kids. So we’re going to have to stand up and fight back.” In September, they fought back and got publicity, with Mr. Wise leading a sit-in outside a McDonald’s in downtown Kansas City, where 52 workers were arrested. Nearly 500 fast-food workers and supporters were arrested nationwide that day. The ones here in Kansas City wore red T-shirts that read, “We Are Worth More,” and sang “This Little Light of Mine” and other civil rights songs. At first, Mr. Wise resisted the push to head the national effort. He eventually gave in, with a sense that this was a role he has been preparing for his whole life. “I feel like that’s what I was supposed to do,” he said. Kendall Fells, national organizing director of Fight for 15, said, “Terrance is a natural-born leader, and he is doing a good job bringing in other leaders.” Mr. Wise says he is by no means the movement’s only leader. Naquasia LeGrand, a KFC worker in New York City, showed her mettle when she did a  Fast-food companies play down the protests, saying the one-day strikes are not strikes and hardly affect their operations. Industry officials often call the movement a union front — indeed, the  McDonald’s says it pays its workers competitive wages and warns that a wage increase will hurt small and medium-size restaurant businesses. Burger King says it has provided entry level jobs for millions of workers. Brad Jones, Missouri director of the  With his fiancée, Myosha, back at her job as a home care aide, Mr. Wise and his family are back in an apartment. (During their homeless months, they stayed with her brother.) Still, the circumstances are problematic: Because of an inadequate heating system, their daughters sleep on the living room couch rather than in their bedroom, which lacks a radiator. To warm the apartment one recent 10-degree night, the family left the oven on, its door open. Their gas was recently shut off when they could not pay the $348 bill. They receive $240 a month in food stamps for their daughters, 13, 11 and 9. They couldn’t afford the annual back-to-school items that might have spared the girls an embarrassing episode — classmates mocked them for wearing the same shoes as last year. Upset about seeing so little of his children, Mr. Wise quit his Pizza Hut job, which had involved a 90-minute bus trip from his Burger King job. He said he had grown frustrated that in his three years at Pizza Hut, his raises totaled just 22 cents, taking him to $7.47, from $7.25, the federal minimum wage. “My store manager showed me a sheet explaining the pay policy,” he said. “It said the maximum raise was 25 cent over three years. She said, ‘If I gave you 25 cents, that means you’re perfect.’ ” Suzy de la Cruz, a Mexican immigrant who works with Mr. Wise at Burger King, said he persuaded her to join Fight for 15. “I respect Terrance; they overwork him just like they overwork me,” she said. Another co-worker, Vanessa Jackson, said: “Terrance goes out on the limb for us. When the manager tries to come down on us, Terrance will say, ‘That’s not cool.’ He has our back on a lot of things.” Mr. Wise insists that a $15 hourly wage is not an impossible dream. “The way to achieve it is to get all types of low-wage workers involved,” he said. “We have to build a movement for all low-wage workers.”
