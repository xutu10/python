Net Neutrality Debate: Access and Costs Are Top Issues
After President Obama urged the F.C.C. to set tougher net neutrality rules, questions loom about decreased competition and the cost of monitoring.

What is the problem with the Internet in the United States? On Monday,  The regulations In principle, this makes sense. It is hard to overstate the importance of broadband to America’s economy and society. Free to do as they pleased, the clutch of companies that control access to the Internet would have enormous power to determine what information reaches Americans online. But would the cure be worse than the disease, entangling the Internet in an endless fight over regulation and perhaps slowing investment in one of the nation’s most vital services? To some extent, it depends on how you view the threat. For Gene Kimmelman, president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge, what’s at stake is no less than American democracy. He can remember 1992, when he was at the Consumer Federation of America pushing a bill that would re-regulate the cable industry and allow new satellite competitors into the market. “I had well-funded satellite providers on my side,” he told me. “There was no cable company that would take their ads.” Left free to decide which content flowed through their pipes, broadband providers could similarly deploy their power in the service of their political preferences. The more prosaic — though actually trickier — issue net neutrality is meant to address is about price. Should broadband providers be allowed to charge providers of content differentially for different speeds or tiers of services? Consumer groups and free speech advocates like Public Knowledge argue this is a surefire way to split the Internet into “haves” — deep-pocketed companies that would pay to have their movies delivered at blistering speed — and “have-nots” that would be relegated to a congested, snail-paced lane. The smart kid with the clever new idea would no longer be able to compete with the zippy websites of established players in the fast lane. The Internet would lose its garage-based engine of creativity. These concerns shouldn’t be lightly dismissed. In a world where the Koch brothers will spend tens of millions to install conservative Republicans in office, Mr. Kimmelman’s political fears are not far-fetched. Still, the threats articulated by the staunchest defenders of a neutral Internet do not quite amount to an imminent danger, nor do they necessarily call for an all-out embrace of traditional regulation. Political spending might be at record highs. But the nation’s broadband goliaths have not, in fact, been using their might to throttle speech online. And they are likely to think twice before, say, alienating Democratic consumers by using their pipes to favor Republican causes. What’s more, the threat to speech is the most easily addressed, via a straightforward ban against blocking or throttling legal content. The pricing threat is even more nebulous. Companies engage in differential pricing all the time, and broadband providers would surely do so if allowed. But that often serves consumers well. Robert Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology Innovation Foundation, noted that it would make sense for services like Skype, which needs its bits to arrive at their destination in a tight, precise sequence, to pay Internet service providers to prioritize their calls over email that doesn’t require such careful timing. Or think of, say, T-Mobile offering to exclude music services from its data cap in order to attract more consumers. Syntonic, whose technology allows companies to provide sponsored content to customers free over wireless carriers, is in fact broadening access by low-income consumers. These forms of discrimination hardly affect other traffic. And with average speeds already around 10 megabits per second, notes Mr. Atkinson, “the market for prioritization is going to be a lot smaller than people think.” To date, the most notable instance of anything resembling paid prioritization is  I once supported reclassifying broadband as a public utility under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, as the president is now proposing. The threat to free speech and innovation on the content side of the broadband economy seemed plausible enough to warrant a heavy hand. So far, however, the most awful situations have not come to pass. While this does not ensure they never will, it suggests that restraint can be achieved through lighter means that do not put at risk other crucial objectives — like broadening access to the Internet and tackling the nation’s very real digital divide. A report published this year President Obama suggested the F.C.C. should apply Title II more lightly than the law provides for, refraining from regulating prices. But other provisions could be equally chilling. Mr. Litan and Mr. Singer outlined how the requirement that broadband companies “unbundle” and lease capacity on their pipes to competitors hamstrung investment for years until the unbundling requirement was dropped. And, in the end, Title II would not necessarily ban differentiated pricing. It would just make it available to all comers on the same terms, banning only “unjust or unreasonable discrimination.” Mr. Litan noted that determining what this means could lead to endless, contentious and politically charged proceedings. The United States has an imperfect Internet. There is little competition in wired broadband, limited mostly to a cable company and a telecom carrier offering less powerful DSL access. Consolidation is shrinking the number of players further. And mobile broadband, while more advanced than in most other countries, is not yet a real competitor for fast fixed broadband. The cable companies that provide most fast broadband have a clear motivation to discriminate against content from rival sources to protect their business model. And their combination with programmers like NBC increases the risk of discriminatory treatment. But these shortcomings won’t be fixed by regulating the flow of content on the Internet like electricity through the wires or voices traveling down a phone line. Stopping unreasonable discrimination can be done at a lower cost, on a case-by-case basis that does not imperil perhaps the most important objective of all: extending the Internet to all Americans. President Obama is right when he argues that the broadband companies connecting Americans to the Internet “have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business.” In the absence of more competition, this will have to be monitored by regulators. But the monitoring should be performed at the least possible cost.
