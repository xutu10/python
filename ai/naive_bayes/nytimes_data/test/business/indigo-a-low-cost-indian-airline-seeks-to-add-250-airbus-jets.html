IndiGo, a Low-Cost Indian Airline, Seeks to Add 250 Airbus Jets
The preliminary deal, worth nearly $26 billion at list prices and possibly Airbus’s largest order yet, reflects the carrier’s long-term plans for expansion.

NEW DELHI — The Indian low-cost airline IndiGo said on Wednesday that it had signed a preliminary agreement to buy 250 A320neo planes from  IndiGo, India’s biggest airline, is expanding aggressively as it seeks to increase its share in one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets and cement its position as the country’s only profitable carrier. The airline said that it would start taking delivery of the planes in 2018 and that it had secured rights to buy a further 100 aircraft from the A320-family. Aditya Ghosh, the president of IndiGo, said in an interview after the announcement that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus. The deal for the planes would be worth $25.7 billion at list prices, although airlines typically get a discount. “We believe India is a highly underpenetrated market,” Mr. Ghosh said. Some of the new planes will be replacements, he added, “but a lot will be for growth.” The provisional deal would extend Airbus’s lead over Boeing in the Indian market. With the IndiGo deal, Airbus appears poised to exceed 1,000 net orders this year, its sales chief said on Wednesday. In the first nine months of 2014, Airbus, with 791 net orders, lagged behind Boeing, with 1,000 net orders. Gross orders for Airbus, before adjustments for model conversions or cancellations, stood at 1,077 aircraft, compared with 1,106 for Boeing. “I think we are going to be comfortably over 1,000 net and over 1,350 or 1,400 gross,” John Leahy, the sales chief for Airbus, said in a telephone interview. Airbus has said it expects deliveries to be about the same as last year, which was a company record of 626 aircraft handed over to customers. The IndiGo deal contradicts recent warnings from some analysts about demand. It also underpins Airbus’s confidence in the market, but it does not by itself change the plane maker’s production plans, Mr. Leahy said. Before the deal announced on Wednesday, IndiGo had a fleet of 83 Airbus A320s and had ordered or taken delivery of an additional 280 Airbus aircraft, including 160 of the upgraded A320neo model that will begin arriving next year. It was one of the first customers for that model. While domestic rivals like SpiceJet are cutting their fleets to help offset losses, IndiGo is expanding in a market where passenger numbers are expected to grow by more than 75 percent in the next six years. The passenger count is forecast to exceed 200 million as more Indians fly for the first time. Started in 2006, IndiGo has grown into the country’s largest airline by market share, with close to a third of the market at the end of the March, according to data from India’s aviation regulator. The airline’s model of selling and leasing back its planes is credited by some analysts with helping to control costs and increase profits. “The way that they position their ownership costs at such a low end is by taking such volume,” Timothy Ross, an Asia transportation industry analyst at Credit Suisse in Singapore. “They have a fairly tight handle on capacity management even though the headline numbers look quite daunting.” Mr. Ghosh, the IndiGo president, said the order reflected his airline’s long-term plans for expansion in India, as well as the fact that the airline retires planes after an average of six years. The airline does not plan on leasing out any of its fleet to third parties and will stick to flying narrow-body aircraft in the domestic market and selected international routes, he said. “With this, we can plan our growth,” Mr. Ghosh said. “It’s been a pattern with IndiGo.” The airline has not selected an engine for the aircraft provisionally ordered on Wednesday, and, given the size of the deal, the engines alone could be worth several billion dollars. Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, and CFM, a joint venture between General Electric and Snecma of France, supply the two types of engines available for the A320neo. IndiGo picked Pratt & Whitney engines for its earlier A320neo order.
