With ‘High Maintenance,’ Vimeo Invests in Original Content
Vimeo, a video-sharing web service built to appeal to fans of higher-quality content than sites like YouTube, is directly funding an original series for the first time and hoping viewers will be willing to pay for it.

“ But will viewers pay to watch it? Vimeo, the video-sharing web service owned by IAC, will release three new episodes of “High Maintenance” on Tuesday. The new episodes — each less than 20 minutes long — are $2 apiece, or $8 for a set that includes three more that will be released in January. This is the first time that Vimeo has funded the series directly, and represents the company’s first push into original content, following a recent trend among larger digital companies such as Yahoo, Netflix and Amazon. While Vimeo’s chief executive, Kerry Trainor, is betting that viewers will pay up, he says his ambitions go beyond generating a new source of revenue. He sees “High Maintenance” as the perfect show to be a foundation for a prestige television brand, and compares his site’s developing identity to that of premium cable in the 1970s, an analogy in which YouTube plays advertising-powered network television to Vimeo’s HBO. “We really feel like Vimeo is in the world to find a higher-quality creator, delivering a different experience than what you’d typically find on YouTube,” Mr. Trainor said. “Not to say that YouTube is bad, but Vimeo on the whole has much more of a premium cable and even a film sensibility. That’s what tends to do well on the platform.” Vimeo’s website is built to appeal to fans who favor the work of auteurs. The language of its  The push into original programming is one of several developments intended to reshape Vimeo’s revenue model. The service, which had 33 percent growth in both unique users and subscribers this quarter, recently  Jessica Casano-Antonellis, Vimeo’s director of communications, compared the on-demand portion of the site to iTunes “in that Vimeo is an open platform” where “anyone can upload and sell content directly.” For the creators of “High Maintenance,” the biggest fear may be that the show’s audience will not be willing to pay for what they used to get free. “The psychology behind it is what’s become interesting to us,” said Katja Blichfield, who writes and directs the show with her husband, Ben Sinclair. “We haven’t experienced pushback yet, but there have been murmurings of people complaining about having to pay now.” For Ms. Blichfield and Mr. Sinclair, the partnership with Vimeo is an experiment that could help pioneer a way for short-form independent filmmakers to make money from their work. “You don’t have to have some goliath managing your content and distributing it for you,” Mr. Sinclair said. “You can get rid of all those middlemen and just get a direct conversation between the artist and the audience.” Apart from helping write, direct and edit the show, Mr. Sinclair plays the marijuana dealer. For the most part, his presence is the only element that links individual episodes; otherwise, each focuses on a separate set of characters and tells a stand-alone story. Episodes can vary sharply in tone. The short, comedic “Olivia” tells the story of two thieving gossips who come across as some of the very worst people in New York; a more meditative episode called “Brad Pitts” is a window into the life of a woman with stomach cancer. On the show, drugs are rarely glamorized or used as a form of cheap titillation; Cheech and Chong this is not. Ms. Blichfield and Mr. Sinclair have each used marijuana for “10 years plus,” and their comfort with the drug is reflected in their characters. Mr. Sinclair’s character, known simply as “the guy,” is not, for most viewers, a scuzzy criminal, but rather a humane, if somewhat dopey, evolution of the bartender — a 21st-century version of Sam Malone from “Cheers.” Though its creators insist that nothing about their approach has changed with the Vimeo partnership (other than their ability to finally pay collaborators what they deserve), faithful viewers will note an increased sophistication in the new episodes. At its core though, the show remains the same. At a screening last week, a fan asked Mr. Sinclair what he and Ms. Blichfield had been doing with “all that Vimeo money.” “It’s what we’ve been doing, plus,” Mr. Sinclair replied. “It’s not a new thing. And it’s been very comforting to be at Vimeo for that.”
