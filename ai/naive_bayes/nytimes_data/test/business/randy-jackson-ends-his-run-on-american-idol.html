Little about the original “American Idol” — including big ratings — remains now that Randy Jackson has decided to leave the singing competition after 13 years as a regular participant on the show. The Fox network and Mr. Jackson announced the news on Tuesday, saying that after 12 years as a judge and one as a mentor to the contestants, Mr. Jackson is leaving the series. As “American Idol” enters its 14th season in January, it is much diminished from its longtime status as a television powerhouse ratings attraction. Only Ryan Seacrest from the show’s original group will return this season. Mr. Jackson, who was a well-regarded bass guitarist before his fame on “American Idol,” worked through numerous cast changes on the show, through the phenomenon days with Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul, and more recent groupings with names like Jennifer Lopez,  Mr. Jackson released a statement saying: “After 13 seasons I felt now was the perfect time to leave ‘American Idol.’ I’m proud to have been a part of a series that discovered some incredible artists and will go down in history as one of the most successful television shows ever.”
