Deborah Bial of the Posse Foundation: Success Isn’t Always About You
An organization’s leaders should remember that its accomplishments may not be of their own doing, a foundation president says.

This interview with Q. Were you in leadership roles as a kid? A. I was a shy kid. There was nothing remarkable about me growing up. I grew up in Teaneck, N.J., in a white house with red shutters and a white picket fence. I walked to school. My dad played in the New York Philharmonic for 38 years — bassoon and contrabassoon — and my mom did P.R. at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. In your leadership style today, do you see strands of your parents’ influence? The most important thing is that my parents were very inclusive. Our voice was always important, and they always asked my sister and me what we thought. They respected us. If we were unhappy about something, they would listen and respond, and even change their approach or views. Did you have ideas about your career path going into college? When I was growing up, I thought I would be an illustrator of children’s books and a writer. When I graduated, I became a paralegal for six months. Then I quit my job to work for the  I was in charge of this idea of Posse, which came from one of the kids — a really smart, great kid from the Bronx who had gotten a scholarship to an Ivy League school and had dropped out, and was back at CityKids. He said, “I never would have dropped out of college if I had my posse with me.” I loved this idea that you send teams of kids together to college so they can back each other up. Social justice motivates me now, but at the time the idea of starting something and making it great really appealed to me. I always wanted whatever I did to be the best. So that was your first management role. Yes, but I still don’t feel like I’m a boss. Why do you say that? I’ve always felt that way. The advantage of being in charge is that you get to hire people you really like. It’s my philosophy that as president or C.E.O. of a company, you are in this privileged position where you get the accolades for the successes of the organization, and you get to make decisions and people have to listen to you. It’s important not to assume that you have that just because of who you are. You got lucky — maybe you had great parents. It’s the same with Posse. I didn’t pick Posse; it just happened. My philosophy is that leaders should always remember that it’s not because of them that things are successful. Other early leadership lessons? I used to care a lot that people liked me. That’s no longer as much the case. Of course, nobody wants not to be liked, but I don’t care as much. I remember feeling liberated when it no longer influenced my decision-making. Early on, we were very inclusive. So if we needed to make a decision, we wanted everybody to feel like they were part of the decision-making process. We still care about that, but as you grow as an organization, you have to put limits on that or else you can’t get anything done. How do you hire? What are you looking for, and what questions do you ask? You have to be really smart. You have to be a hard worker. And you have to be positive. In terms of questions, I’ll ask sometimes: “If you get this job, what are you most excited about, in terms of your personal growth? And where will you be challenged the most?” Then I’ll want to get into a discussion about something. What’s in the newspaper that day? I want to know what they think, how they think, how they express what it is they’re thinking, how they ask questions and how they listen. There are a lot of students who come through your program. What makes the biggest difference in terms of who ultimately succeeds and who doesn’t? In a crisis, they reach out versus reach in. We look for the person who reaches out, because they will give themselves more options to succeed. And how do you assess which students to give scholarships to? One thing we do really well at Posse is recognize who has potential, and we ask great questions. The way we interview kids is so nontraditional. I can rattle off a series of questions right now that would get us talking for hours. “What percentage of you is your dark side?” Or “If you could press a button and make the entire world religious, or press a button and get rid of religion altogether, what would you do?” We ask questions about how politics and religion intersect today in America — not just generally, but how does it play out on your campus? Then we build all these workshops and activities around those questions, so that kids talk about things they wouldn’t normally talk about. We use a “dynamic assessment process.” We bring together 100 high school seniors who have been nominated by their schools. We put them in small groups, and then someone will pull a question out of an envelope like: “If you could determine the genetic makeup of your child, would you do that? Now run the discussion.” Or “Aside from education, what’s a social/political issue you care deeply about? Go.” They have four minutes to run a discussion with nine other people. In that setting, certain kids stand out, and not because they answered the question the right way. It’s because they were dynamic, they had great communication skills, they took charge, they were gregarious and other students responded to them with some kind of interest and loyalty. Those are the kids who get called back for Round 2 of an interview for Posse, before we even look at their SAT scores.
