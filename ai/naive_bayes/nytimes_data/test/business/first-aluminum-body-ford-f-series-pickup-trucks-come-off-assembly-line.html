First Aluminum-Body Ford F-Series Pickup Trucks Come Off Assembly Line
The automaker hopes that the truck will be a hit with consumers and be a step toward reaching new government fuel standards.

DEARBORN, Mich. —  It was hardly planned this way, but  Despite the timing, Ford is betting that its new aluminum-body F-series pickup truck will be a hit with consumers and an important step toward achieving new government fuel standards. “Even with gas at $3 a gallon, fuel economy is still very important to people,” William Clay Ford Jr., the automaker’s executive chairman, said at the ceremonial introduction of the pickup at Ford’s Dearborn Truck assembly plant. Mr. Ford said that gas consumption was the largest area of consumer dissatisfaction in the purchase of pickup trucks. And with Ford shooting for a 20 percent increase in fuel economy in the new truck over the current version of the F-series, the company hopes to get a jump on its hometown rivals General Motors and Chrysler in the pickup wars. But it is a big gamble, to make such a significant change to what has long been the best-selling vehicle in the United States. Ford has spent an estimated $1 billion overhauling its pickup plants in Dearborn and Kansas City to build the new vehicle, which is 700 pounds lighter than the previous model because of the use of aluminum body panels. It is the most extensive conversion to aluminum parts that Ford has ever taken on. But the company is confident that truck buyers will embrace the lighter truck and its plethora of new technology and features. “Is this a risk? Yes,” Mr. Ford said. “But it’s a risk worth taking.” All automakers are scrambling to improve fuel economy throughout their lineups in an effort to meet new government rules that require their fleets to achieve an average of 54.5 miles a gallon by 2025. The average fuel economy in vehicles sold in October was 25.3 miles per gallon, according to the Transportation Research Institute at the University of Michigan. In addition to being the top-selling vehicle in the United States, Ford’s F-series is also a huge source of profits for company, the nation’s second-largest automaker behind General Motors. The current version of the truck gets a combined city-and-highway fuel economy of about 19 miles per gallon, when equipped with a standard V-6 engine. But by using aluminum extensively, the new model will achieve better results. The final mileage figures will be set by the Environmental Protection Agency before the new truck goes on sale next month. Mr. Ford and Mark Fields, the company’s chief executive, said the truck would be just as reliable and powerful as previous versions of the F-series, which used steel for the body panels and pickup bed. Yet, the vehicle’s capabilities still need to be proved under real-world conditions, particularly on construction sites. There are also questions as to whether dents and other damage in aluminum panels can be repaired as easily as steel. Still, the conversion to aluminum is seen within the industry as a critical development in the race by automakers to achieve significantly better fuel economy. “If it goes according to plan, Ford will have a substantial advantage in the area of lightweight materials,” said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book. G.M. is expected to make greater use of aluminum in its next generation of pickup trucks. Mr. Ford declined to say what future Ford models might be next in line for a large conversion to lighter materials. The F-series event on Tuesday was a victory lap of sorts for Ford, which has managed to maintain its United States market share, for the most part, despite a blitz of new models in addition to the pickup. Ford is adding 850 jobs for the new truck at the Dearborn plant, which stopped production so employees could cheer as the plant’s manager, Brad Huff, and a senior United Automobile Workers official, James Settles Jr., drove the first aluminum F-150 off the assembly line. Mr. Settles recalled darker times a decade ago, when Ford considered closing the historic plant in the heart of the Rouge assembly complex originally developed by Henry Ford. But sales of the F-series pickup not only sustained the plant, but also provided the profits that kept the company afloat financially. “Over time, you will see that this is the one vehicle that saved the
