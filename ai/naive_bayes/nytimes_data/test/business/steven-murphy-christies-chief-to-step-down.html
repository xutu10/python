Steven P. Murphy, Christie’s chief executive, is stepping down at the end of the year, the auction house announced on Tuesday. He will be succeeded by Patricia Barbizet, who has been chief executive of the Artemis Group, the investment company founded by François Pinault, the luxury-goods magnate and owner of Christie’s. She will retain her role as chairwoman of Christie’s. Ms. Barbizet has long been a top aide to Mr. Pinault. A former publishing and music industry executive, Mr. Murphy joined the auction house in 2010. “When I came here I was asked to lead the auction house to a new place and we have successfully done that,” Mr. Murphy said in a telephone interview. “The company is in the strongest position ever.” The news comes just 10 days after William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby’s chief executive, announced he was stepping down “by mutual consent” after 14 years at the helm.
