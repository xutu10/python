Supreme Court Rules Against Worker Pay for Security Waits at Amazon Warehouses
The court unanimously decided that the screenings, common among retailers and meant to curb theft, were not “integral and indispensable” to their jobs.

WASHINGTON — The  Justice  The decision was a big loss for workers challenging the security checks, which are common among retailers. According to  The case that the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday turned on the meaning of a 1947 law, the  The case decided Tuesday was brought by Jesse Busk, who worked in a Las Vegas warehouse, and Laurie Castro, who worked at one in Fenley, Nev. They sued Integrity Staffing Solutions, the temp agency, seeking to represent a class of workers and to be paid for the time it took to remove their wallets, keys and belts and to pass through metal detectors. The plaintiffs said the screenings would not have taken long had the agency added more security screeners or staggered the ends of work shifts. In practice, they said, the waits approached half an hour. Amazon has disputed that assertion. In a statement in October, when the case was argued, an Amazon spokeswoman said “employees walk through postshift security screening with little or no wait.” The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, had  Justice Thomas disagreed, saying the appeals court had “erred by focusing on whether an employer required a particular activity.” The right test, he said, was whether the activity “is tied to the productive work that the employee is employed to perform.” Justice Thomas said Tuesday’s ruling was required by the 1947 law, which was a reaction to Supreme Court decisions that had required pay for a broad range of work-related activities and gave rise to “a flood of litigation” seeking nearly $6 billion. Congress responded by tightening the standards, saying the alternative would have been the “financial ruin of many employers.” Since then, Justice Thomas said, the court has required pay for activities that were “an intrinsic element of the job” and could not be skipped. Under that test, battery-plant workers had to be paid for the time spent showering and changing clothes because the materials they worked with were toxic. And meatpackers had to be paid for the time it took to sharpen their knives because dull knives would slow production. Security screenings are different, Justice Thomas wrote. “Integrity Staffing could have eliminated the screenings altogether,” he wrote, “without impairing the employees’ ability to complete their work.″ Justice Thomas noted that the Obama administration had sided with the temp agency, adding that the administration’s position was consistent with a 1951 letter from the Labor Department that did not require pay for screenings at a rocket-powder plant. Workers there were screened for matches and lighters on the way in and to prevent theft on the way out. Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined the court’s opinion but added a concurrence to stress its limited scope. Activities related to worker safety and efficiency remained covered, she said. But in the warehouse case, she wrote, “employees could skip the screenings altogether without the safety of effectiveness of their principal activities being substantially impaired.” She added that, as its name suggests, the Portal-to-Portal Act was “primarily concerned with defining the beginning and end of the workday.” “The searches were part of the process by which the employees egressed their place of work, akin to checking in and out and waiting in line to do so,” she wrote, adding that those were activities that Congress clearly meant to make noncompensable. Justice Elena Kagan joined Justice Sotomayor’s concurrence in the case, Integrity Staffing Solutions v. Busk, No. 13-433.
