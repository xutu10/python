Last Maker of Strong Magnets Deemed Hazard to Children Fights Safety Ban
Shihan Qu of Zen Magnets is the only manufacturer still resisting the agency’s demand that Buckyballs and similar magnets be recalled after children were injured.

Buckyballs are dead — banned by federal authorities as a threat to children who might ingest them. But Shihan Qu is waging a lonely battle to save his version of the powerful little magnetic toys. Mr. Qu is the only manufacturer still fighting the  Mr. Qu’s fight to keep selling his product, Zen Magnets, is an unusual clash between a lone entrepreneur and the safety commission, which has made these types of magnets the centerpiece of its most aggressive action in years. It is a fight Mr. Qu knows he may not win. “I’ve been thinking a lot about that recently, whether or not this is worth it,” Mr. Qu, 27, said in a recent interview. “Of course it’s very stressful, but at this point stress is nothing new to me.” Mr. Qu’s is a quixotic battle to save his company in the face of what he sees as an overly aggressive safety campaign. He says what many in his position might say: This fight is about more than just the money. Legitimate safety concerns, he argues, must be balanced by the rights of small businesses and entrepreneurs. But to the safety commission, that balance is clearly tipped toward protecting consumers, given the injuries some children have sustained. The magnets are powerful enough to cling to one another on opposite sides of the intestines. That can cut off the blood flow to the stomach, a situation that can be lethal. “It’s likely a parent wouldn’t even know that some magnets were missing, and the symptoms a child would have certainly wouldn’t be clear that they had swallowed something,” said Rachel Weintraub, the legislative director and senior counsel at the Consumer Federation of America. “It is a hidden hazard with very serious consequences.” One child has died so far. Her mother, Amber Chaffin, attended a hearing last month during which the safety approved new limits on high-powered magnets. Ms. Chaffin sat quietly, nodding occasionally, one arm wrapped around her son. “For me, the action we are taking today is accompanied by the tremendous amounts of loss and hurt that many have experienced and still will experience,” said Elliot F. Kaye, who was confirmed as the commission’s chairman in July, at Wednesday’s meeting. “Many hurt emotionally, whether that be from enduring their child suffering from these horrible injuries or whether that be a business owner grappling to accept an entrepreneurial dream faces possible extinction.” From 2009 to 2013, 2,900 children and teenagers needed immediate medical attention because they had ingested at least one high-powered magnet, the commission says, citing data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, the agency’s network of self-reporting emergency rooms. The agency argued that Buckyballs and other brands, which typically came hundreds to a set, could easily be lost in rugs or floorboards where children play. It has highlighted the case of Ms. Chaffin’s 19-month-old daughter, Annaka, and another young boy, who had to have most of his intestines removed. Mr. Kaye has repeatedly described magnet injuries as “gunshot wounds to the gut but without sign of entry or exit.” The campaign against high-powered magnets is the commission’s most aggressive since Congress expanded its authority in 2008. Long criticized as ineffective, the agency received broader authority and resources under the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. The agency says the magnets fall under its stronger mandate to protect the public. “It may be a stretch beyond what they’ve done in the past, and surely a stretch beyond their relative inactivity,” said Robert L. Rabin, a law professor at Stanford University who specializes in health and safety regulation. “But I don’t think it in any way is outside the scope of their authority.” Zen Magnets is the last hurdle for the agency, which has ruled that high-powered magnets must either be too large for a child to swallow or about one-fiftieth as powerful than Buckyballs. Buckyballs, sets of magnetically stacking spheres, became the face of the commission’s safety campaign when the company that made them, Maxfield & Oberton, refused for years to issue a recall. The company capitulated this summer. At the time, Craig Zucker, one of its co-founders, said he had spent more on legal fees than on the settlement, which would require him to pay up to $375,000. He got off lucky: The safety agency originally tried to hold him personally liable for up to $57 million. Mr. Zucker waged a much longer fight than many of his smaller competitors. “I chose to bite the bullet and close up shop because I couldn’t do the recall and couldn’t stand and fight against it,” said Nicholas Powell, the founder of Cybercube, which sold high-powered magnets similar to those sold by Buckyballs and Zen Magnets. Mr. Powell said he was slowly paying off about $50,000 in debt after he shut his company in 2012, when the safety commission pushed 13 businesses, including Maxfield & Oberton and Zen Magnets, to stop selling their products. Now, Mr. Qu is the lone holdout. He started the company with an ex-girlfriend in 2009, when they scraped together $400 to begin buying and shipping magnets, he said. They began by buying and reselling them on the Internet, and slowly built up demand until they had enough revenue to team up with a manufacturer in China. Mr. Qu, who answers the phones himself, estimates he has sold 30,000 to 40,000 units. In December, he will try to persuade an administrative law judge that his products are safe when used properly. If he wins, the commission will have to appeal — and prevail — to force him to recall products it has already deemed illegal. Critics of the agency say its adoption of a new rule for such magnets was inappropriate, giving the pending case. The timing bothered one commissioner, Ann Marie Buerkle, who recused herself from last week’s vote. “Under these highly unusual circumstances, I believe it would have been preferable to postpone the rule making until the closely related adjudication is no longer pending before the agency,” Ms. Buerkle said in a statement.
