EUROPEAN UNION TO PUBLISH GROWTH AND JOBS FORECASTS  The  EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK  The European Central Bank will hold its monthly monetary policy meeting Thursday in Frankfurt. Analysts do not expect any policy moves, but investors will be listening closely for any indications that the central bank is moving closer to buying government bonds as part of a more aggressive effort to stimulate the eurozone economy.  YELLEN AND LAGARDE TO DEBATE ECONOMIC POLICY Janet L. Yellen, chief of the Federal Reserve, will debate economic policy with Christine Lagarde, above, managing director of the International Monetary Fund; Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India; and other prominent guests on Friday at a conference in Paris.  DATA ON JOB CREATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT IS DUE  On Friday, the Labor Department will release the latest data on job creation and unemployment in October. The report for September was surprisingly robust, with the unemployment rate dropping below 6 percent for the first time since 2008. This time, the consensus among Wall Street economists calls for the unemployment rate to be unchanged at 5.9 percent, with payrolls growing by 234,000.
