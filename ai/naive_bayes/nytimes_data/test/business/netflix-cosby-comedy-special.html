LOS ANGELES — Netflix says it is postponing Bill Cosby’s upcoming standup comedy special. A spokesperson for the company said it was postponing the launch of “Bill Cosby 77.” This follows accusations that Mr. Cosby had sexually assaulted several women. Mr. Cosby has remained silent, and his attorney, John P. Schmitt, issued a statement Sunday saying his client would not dignify “decade-old, discredited” claims of sexual abuse with a response. Mr. Cosby, 77, was never criminally charged in any case.
