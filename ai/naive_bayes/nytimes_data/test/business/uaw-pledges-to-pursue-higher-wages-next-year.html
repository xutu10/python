U.A.W. Pledges to Pursue Higher Wages Next Year
Dennis Williams, president of the United Automobile Workers union, said his members deserve a larger share in the recent success of Detroit’s carmakers.

DETROIT —  With auto sales booming and domestic carmakers earning healthy profits, the  Dennis Williams, the U.A.W.’s new president, said on Monday that workers at General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler deserve a larger share in the success of the companies, particularly after the union has held the line on wages in previous contracts and agreed to lower pay for entry-level jobs. “Our members have sacrificed a great deal over time,” said Mr. Williams, who was elected to the union’s top job in June. “The companies need to realize it’s time for our membership to be rewarded.” Mr. Williams made his comments at a media round table that previewed some of the issues percolating for next year’s critical contract talks. About 130,000 U.A.W. members work for the Detroit carmakers in the United States. Union locals are currently making proposals to Mr. Williams for the coming contract, which will then be discussed at a bargaining convention in March. And while actual negotiations on a new labor agreement will not kick off until next summer, Mr. Williams is already beating the drum for pay increases for longtime workers and more parity for new employees. In 2007, the union agreed to the creation of entry-level jobs that paid considerably less than the average of $27 an hour for longtime employees known as “legacy” workers. In the current contract negotiated four years ago, the union accepted larger profit-sharing payments in lieu of a wage increase for the legacy workers. It also won an increase in entry-level pay from $15 an hour to $19 an hour for new workers, starting next year. But Mr. Williams said both the new and older workers deserve wage increases in the next contract with the Detroit auto companies. “The legacy employees have not had a general wage increase in many years, and we’re going to address that,” he said. As far as newer workers are concerned, he stopped short of saying the two-tier wage system should be eliminated. Yet he said their current wage scale was not enough to allow them to buy the new cars they were making in assembly plants across the United States. “Are hourly wages currently in the second tier acceptable to me?” Mr. Williams asked. “No.” The U.A.W.’s tough stance comes after tens of thousands of union jobs were cut during the recession, when both G.M. and Chrysler went bankrupt and were bailed out by the federal government. “For both sides, this upcoming contract has high stakes,” said Harley Shaiken, a professor specializing in labor issues at the University of California, Berkeley. He said that the bankruptcies at G.M. and Chrysler forced the union to accept plant closings and job reductions, as well as wage concessions in the current contract. But times have changed in the American auto industry. Annual sales of new vehicles will exceed 16 million this year for the first time since 2007, and all three domestic manufacturers are reporting strong profits. “The union is intent on gaining a larger share in the success that they have played an integral part in,” Mr. Shaiken said. “But they are also acutely aware of the competitive issues that the Detroit companies still face.” The Detroit companies have so far generally avoided talking about the scheduled negotiations, preferring to focus on the addition of new jobs and billions of dollars in investments in their United States facilities since the recession. “We’re looking forward to continuing our strong U.A.W. partnership as well as negotiating a fair and competitive labor agreement,” said a Ford spokeswoman, Kristina Adamski, in a statement similar to comments that G.M. and Chrysler have made. Industry analysts say that the gap in labor costs has shrunk between the domestic automakers and foreign companies that employ lower-paid nonunion workers at their American factories. Much of the reduction in costs can be attributed to the growing number of entry-level workers at the Detroit manufacturers. The number of new workers range from below 20 percent at G.M. to more than 40 percent at Chrysler. Yet foreign carmakers still have lower overall labor costs in the United States, and they make greater use of temporary workers. Mr. Williams accused foreign automakers of exploiting part-time workers to gain an advantage over the Detroit companies. “The two-tier employees at the Big Three have a right to collective bargaining, which gives them an opportunity to increase their standard of living,” he said. “When you look at the temporaries and part-timers, they don’t have that opportunity.” He pledged to continue efforts to organize work forces at plants operated in the southern United States by the Japanese automaker Nissan and the German manufacturers Volkswagen and Daimler. He also said the union would continue to fight international trade agreements that encourage American companies to move jobs to lower-wage nations. Mr. Williams was particularly critical of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he said had caused 700,000 American manufacturing jobs to move to Mexico in the last two decades. “Nafta in my mind has been a failure,” he said. “The whole argument for it was how we are going to lift the living standard for Mexican workers, and that has not happened.”
