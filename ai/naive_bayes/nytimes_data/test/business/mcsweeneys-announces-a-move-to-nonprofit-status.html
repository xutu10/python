McSweeney’s Announces a Move to Nonprofit Status
The change will allow the imprint, which was founded 16 years ago by the writer Dave Eggers, to be more ambitious in areas that hold little commercial promise.

McSweeney’s, the imprint founded 16 years ago by the writer  With its independent book imprint, quarterly literary journal and monthly magazine, McSweeney’s mission was always to put out quirky, whimsical, commercially risky material without bending to the crass pressures of the marketplace. Huge profits — or, really, any profits — were never really part of the business plan. Now, McSweeney’s is officially becoming what it has unofficially been for years: a nonprofit in the mold of small, independent nonprofit publishers like Graywolf Press, Heyday Books and Copper Canyon, Mr. Eggers said on Thursday. “For 15 years now, it’s been a break-even operation,” Mr. Eggers said in an interview. “I’ve always been attracted to books and projects that we love and are passionate about, and it doesn’t always intersect with books that will sell a million copies.” Mr. Eggers, 44, said that turning McSweeney’s into a nonprofit won’t result in scaling back its publishing operation or its output of around 25 books a year. Instead, he said, it will allow the company to be more ambitious in areas that traditional publishers have largely neglected because they hold little commercial promise, like poetry and foreign translations. The Believer, McSweeney’s monthly magazine, will become a bimonthly magazine beginning in January, but it will be longer and have more pieces of investigative journalism, Mr. Eggers said. New projects in the works include an expanded series of poetry books; a fiction anthology from Caribbean authors, edited by the Jamaican novelist Marlon James; a collection of writing by women from South Sudan; and collection about American waterways, with work from journalists, novelists and poets. Mr. Eggers said he has been contemplating this shift for more than a decade, after realizing that the company’s corporate status “artificially limited” the scale and scope of its literary projects. He has some experience in the nonprofit sector, and has started a handful of organizations, like Voice of Witness, a nonprofit dedicated to collecting oral histories from survivors of war, human rights crises and natural disasters; 826 National, a tutoring organization focused largely on writing and literacy; and ScholarMatch, a nonprofit that connects students with donors to help make college affordable. Mr. Eggers declined to outline the operating budget for McSweeney’s, or to identify some of the foundations that have expressed interest in supporting the publisher. But he said that McSweeney’s will draw on everything from crowdfunding to grants from foundations and individuals. “Our goal is to exist and keep on publishing in whatever way is most viable, and for us that’s as a nonprofit,” he said.
