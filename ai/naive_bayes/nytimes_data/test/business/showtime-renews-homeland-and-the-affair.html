The two series draw millions of viewer for the cable channel, through multiple broadcasts.

Showtime shrugged off the occasional critical barb about the last season of “Homeland” and announced on Monday that it had renewed the Emmy-winning espionage drama for a fifth season. The creators of “Homeland” went into the current season worried about how their efforts to reinvent the series would be accepted. But so far the new season has been well received, especially the episode that aired a week ago, which was reviewed as one of the best in the show’s run. At the same time Showtime announced that it would be bringing back its newest drama, “The Affair,” for a second season. The show, an hourlong series that stars Dominic West, has earned mostly strong reviews. Ratings have become an ever more fungible statistic in television, but especially at pay-cable networks, which depend on multiple runs on multiple platforms, but Showtime reports that “Homeland,” which first broadcasts at 9 p.m. on Sundays, is being watched by six million viewers this season, while “The Affair,” which follows at 10 p.m., is averaging an audience of 3.9 million. “The Affair” is especially affected by delayed viewing; Showtime says the show is on pace to be the network’s most time-shifted show.
