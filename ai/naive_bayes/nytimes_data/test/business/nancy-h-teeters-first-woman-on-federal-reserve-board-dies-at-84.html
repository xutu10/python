Nancy H. Teeters, First Woman on Federal Reserve Board, Dies at 84
A liberal economist, Mrs. Teeters often criticized actions by her fellow governors.

Nancy H. Teeters, a liberal economist who was the first woman appointed to the  Her daughter, Ann Teeters Johnson, said the cause was complications of a series of strokes. Mrs. Teeters was a former economics adviser to President John F. Kennedy and the chief economist for the House Budget Committee when President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the Fed’s seven-member Board of Governors in 1978. Her tenure, which ended in 1984, coincided with a period of economic volatility during which the Fed sought to combat a stubborn bout of inflation, generated by high oil prices and deficit spending, by tightening the money supply. While she agreed with the need to control inflation, which approached 14 percent in 1980, Mrs. Teeters criticized the Federal Reserve chairman, Paul A. Volcker, and the board’s majority for squeezing the money supply too tightly. By sending the prime rate to a record high of 21.5 percent in 1981, she warned, the Fed risked pushing the economy into a recession and leaving millions of people out of work. Her analysis proved correct. But her dissent, first in internal meetings, then in public statements, did not succeed in changing the Fed’s inflation policy. Mrs. Teeters raised other issues as well. She was outspoken in her opposition to the spate of mergers and acquisitions, beginning in the early 1980s, which created the current system of “too big to fail” superbanks. When the Fed gave banks the right to raise credit card fees and interest rates without notice — only weeks after rejecting a measure that would have banned prepayment penalties for consumers — she accused the board of declaring, in effect, that “consumer issues are not big issues.” Some saw her public statements, while restrained, as violating the clubby traditions of a panel that had made institutional harmony — or at least the appearance of it — its cornerstone since 1913, when the Federal Reserve Board of Governors was established by Congress to maintain the stability of the nation’s financial system. In private, Mrs. Teeters was less retrained. “I told them, ‘You are pulling the financial fabric of this country so tight that it’s going to rip,’ ” she said in interview for the journalist William Greider’s book “Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country,” published in 1987. She added, “Once you tear a piece of fabric, it’s very difficult, almost impossible, to put it back together again.” She chose the metaphor purposely, she told Mr. Greider, in an effort to sound a real-world — and female — note rarely heard in those halls. “None of these guys has ever sewn anything in his life,” she said. Mrs. Teeters was born Nancy Hays on July 29, 1930, in Marian, Ind., the youngest of three children of Edgar and Mabel Hays. Her father was an unsuccessful oil speculator who had returned to his hometown in Indiana in the late 1920s to work as a paper box salesman. Her mother, a homemaker, tried to discourage Nancy, her only daughter and a top student, from attending college. With her father’s support, she went to college anyway, graduating from Oberlin in 1952. After marrying a fellow student, Robert D. Teeters, they both went to the University of Michigan to pursue graduate studies — he in biology, she in economics. She earned a master’s degree in economics in 1954 and continued her studies at Michigan until 1957, when the Teeterses moved to Washington, where they both had secured jobs. Mr. Teeters worked at the Interior Department. Mrs. Teeter was hired by the research and statistics division of the Federal Reserve. She rose to staff economist, took a leave of absence from 1962 to 1963 to serve on President Kennedy’s Council of Economic Advisers, then returned to the Fed. In 1966, she went to work in the White House Bureau of the Budget, the forerunner of the Office of Management and Budget, under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Mrs. Teeter was a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution from 1970 to 1973. From 1974 until she joined the Federal Reserve board, she was the assistant staff director and chief economist for the House Budget Committee. After leaving the board, she was director of economics for IBM, forecasting business trends. Besides her daughter, Ann, Mrs. Teeters is survived by her sons, James and John; six grandchildren; and a brother, James Hays. Her husband died in 2008. When Mrs. Teeters attended a luncheon for current and past governors of the Federal Reserve in 2013 to commemorate the board’s 100th anniversary, she sat at a table with seven other women who had served since she left, including Janet L. Yellen, who was awaiting Senate confirmation to become the first Fed chairwoman. The room buzzed with excitement and all eyes seemed to be on the women’s table, Mrs. Teeters’s daughter said, citing her mother’s account. Mrs. Teeters, she added, liked telling friends and family afterward, “It was the first time I’ve been seated at a women’s-only table and been the envy of the room.”
