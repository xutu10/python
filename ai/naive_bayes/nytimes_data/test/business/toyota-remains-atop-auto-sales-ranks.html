Toyota kept its lead over its rivals Volkswagen and General Motors as the world’s top-selling automaker in the first nine months of the year, reporting record sales on Monday of 7.615 million vehicles — up nearly 3 percent from the previous year. Volkswagen said this month it sold 7.40 million vehicles for January-September, barely edging out General Motors, which reported sales of 7.372 million. Toyota finished first last year with 9.98 million sales, and is projecting annual sales of 10.2 million this year. That would be an auto industry record. G.M. does not give annual sales projections, but Volkswagen has said it might deliver 10 million vehicles this year. General Motors was the No. 1 selling automaker for more than seven decades before losing the title to Toyota in 2008. It retook the lead in 2011, when Toyota’s production was hurt by an earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan. Toyota made a comeback in 2012 and has kept the lead.
