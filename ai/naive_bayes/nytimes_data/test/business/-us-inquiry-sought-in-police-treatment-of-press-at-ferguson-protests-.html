 U.S. Inquiry Sought in Police Treatment of Press at Ferguson Protests 
A report by the PEN American Center cited police interference with journalists, including holding reporters in areas that denied them access to the protests, and accusations of threats and assaults.

Compiling 52 accusations of violations of the freedom of the press during the protests in Ferguson, Mo., after the killing of Michael Brown, the PEN American Center will announce on Monday that it is calling on the Justice Department to investigate the local police forces’ treatment of the news media. Such an investigation, a report by the organization said, would “shed essential light on the factors that drove law enforcement officers in Ferguson to infringe on media freedoms,” and should lead to new guidelines from the Justice Department for police departments in the United States “on respect for media freedoms during public demonstrations.” A copy of  The PEN report described a range of police interference with journalists who covered the protests that followed the fatal shooting on Aug. 9 of Mr. Brown by Officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson Police Department. Mr. Brown, 18, was not armed. The examples in the report included the decision to hold reporters in areas that denied them access to the events they had come to cover, and accusations of flashing lights to hinder photographers and of threats and assaults, culminating in the arrest of 21 journalists. Most of the episodes occurred from Aug. 12 through Aug. 20, according to the report, which was based on news accounts, photographs and videos of the protests, Twitter feeds by journalists and interviews. On Friday, a report from Amnesty International highlighted a variety of “human rights concerns” during the Ferguson protests, including the arrest of journalists. An overarching complaint in the PEN and Amnesty International reports was the police forces’ show of extreme force in response to the protests, including the use of assault rifles, tear gas, pepper spray, attack dogs and rubber bullets. “One of the chief lessons demonstrated by the allegations contained in this report is that militarized policing is not an appropriate or useful response to a public demonstration,” the PEN report said. The St. Louis County Police Department told the PEN researchers that its officers had “recently undergone training that included an extensive review of the First, Fourth and 14th Amendments.” The department said, “Each officer will have a laminated card on them at all times with rights of the press.” Sgt. Brian Schellman, the department’s spokesman, said in an interview that the protests surprised the department, but that the training would reinforce that reporters “are there for a purpose as well, and we don’t want to encroach on that ability.” The PEN report noted that the definition of the press was expanding, since anyone with a Twitter feed or an Instagram account during the protests could credibly be described as a journalist informing the public. While agreeing that the blurring line between credentialed journalists and the public poses challenges for the police as they respond to protests, Suzanne Nossel, executive director of the PEN American Center, said that many of those distinctions were beside the point. “The rights most important to the press are the rights everyone holds — to ask questions, to communicate, to be in a public place if they are acting peacefully,” she said in an interview.
