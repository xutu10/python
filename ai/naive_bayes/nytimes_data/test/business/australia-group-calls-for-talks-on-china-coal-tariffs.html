Australia Group Calls for Talks on China Coal Tariffs
Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia said the government would work with China, a major buyer of the country’s coal, to resolve the situation.

MELBOURNE, Australia — Australia must hold urgent talks with China to exempt coal producers from new tariffs in a free-trade agreement expected to be completed this year, an Australian industry body said Friday after a move by Beijing to reintroduce coal tariffs after nearly a decade. China, the world’s top coal importer, said on Thursday that it would impose import tariffs, in its latest effort to prop up ailing domestic mining companies, which have been hit by rising costs and plunging prices. The industry group, the Minerals Council of Australia, said the move to reinstate the tariffs raised the stakes in free-trade talks with China and pressed the Australian government to ask Beijing to reverse the decision. “This is the kind of hiccup in our biggest and most important trading relationship that we just don’t want or need,” Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia said at a news conference. “We’ll work with the Chinese to get to the bottom of what seems to have happened overnight.” The tariffs would hit Australian producers hardest because Australia’s main coal export rival, Indonesia, would be exempt from the tariffs through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ free-trade agreement with China. Coal is Australia’s second-largest export, after iron ore. Shares in Whitehaven Coal slipped 8.8 percent on Friday in trading in Australia, where the big, diversified mining companies  In the year ended in June, China took nearly a quarter of Australia’s exports of metallurgical coal, used to make steel, buying $4.8 billion worth. It also took about a fifth of Australia’s exports of thermal coal, used to fuel power plants, buying $3 billion worth. The Chinese Ministry of Finance said on Thursday that import tariffs for metallurgical coal would be reinstated at 3 percent, with a 6 percent tariff on thermal coal. Trade Minister Andrew Robb played down the impact on mining companies, saying that China was likely to consume an additional one billion tons of coal over the next five years and that Australia would be a competitive source to fill that demand given the high quality of its coal. Traders said that the sudden announcement may prompt Chinese buyers to delay or renegotiate pricing for fourth-quarter shipments, and that the buyers may even purposely default on near-term shipments. BHP, Glencore and Rio Tinto had no immediate comment on the Chinese tariffs. Another mining company, Anglo American, declined to comment. “The full impact of this on Australia will also depend on whether exporters can switch to other markets such as Korea, Japan and India,” said Rohan Kendall, an analyst in Beijing for the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. “So this is likely going to be a modest impact on Australia and not a huge one on miners.” The extent of the impact will also depend on Chinese coal prices and whether top domestic mining companies like the Shenhua Group take the opportunity to raise prices during the winter restocking period, traders and analysts said. The tariffs come on top of measures that China announced in September to curb pollution, banning coal with high ash and sulfur content for some users starting next year.
