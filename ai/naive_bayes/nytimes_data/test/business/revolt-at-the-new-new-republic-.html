Revolt at the New New Republic
Chris Hughes, a Facebook founder, purchased The New Republic magazine in 2012 praising its journalistic history, but recent decisions there have led to a walkout by several staff members.
===
In retrospect, last week’s meltdown at The New Republic should have been easy to predict. The quintessential social media mogul — Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard roommate — buys the ultimate symbol of the old media, a progressive opinion journal that dates back to the Woodrow Wilson administration. What could possibly go wrong? But when the 28-year-old Chris Hughes snapped up The New Republic in 2012, he cast himself as more preservationist than disrupter, praising the magazine’s rich tradition of rigorous reporting and speaking of the public’s appetite for quality, in-depth journalism. The staff who joined, or rejoined, felt as if they were part of a romantic endeavor, as much a restoration as a relaunch. Writers were offered generous salaries and assured that they would be given time and space. The website was redesigned, not to drive more traffic and thus lure advertisers but to look cleaner. The print magazine, Mr. Hughes said, would remain the primary product. Now, like the nouveau riche buyer who says he’s only planning to slap a fresh coat of paint on that New England colonial but soon embarks on a tear-down, Mr. Hughes has apparently reconsidered. In October, he hired as chief executive a former Yahoo official, Guy Vidra, who told the staff that he intended to break stuff — though he used a profanity — and to rebuild the magazine as a “vertically integrated digital media company.” And last week, Mr. Hughes  The moves  The walkout and letter were a protest against Mr. Hughes’ stewardship of the magazine, but in a more general sense they represented a defense of an endangered journalistic ideal that the high-minded, unapologetically wonky New Republic embodied in its purest form. It was the right place and the right time for a last stand. And so what started out as a fairy tale turned into a cautionary one about this fraught moment in the history of the media, when news meetings at even the most respected publications are increasingly taken up with conversations about audience development and search engine optimization. Silicon Valley has presented itself as at least one possible solution to the old media’s struggles to remain relevant and viable. But tech moguls are proving to be complicated saviors. Only weeks before the blowup at The New Republic, the former Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi  But that was just another digital media start-up, if a prominent one. This was The New Republic. Mr. Omidyar and Vinit Bharara, the Diapers.com co-founder who recently started the web venture Cafe.com, both created something new. Why didn’t Mr. Hughes? The answer seems to be that that Mr. Hughes, who reads Honoré de Balzac in the original French, doesn’t see himself as a typical Silicon Valley millionaire. At Harvard, he concentrated in history and literature. At Facebook, which he helped found, he focused on communications and customer service, not coding. Mr. Hughes, who declined to discuss details of the recent controversy, left Facebook in 2007 with an estimated fortune of $700 million to join the Obama campaign, where he created the president’s first Facebook profile and helped run online organizing. He had always been interested in journalism, though; in high school, at Andover, he was news director of The Phillipian. He became particularly enamored of The New Republic, spending hours reading back issues at the New York Public Library before buying the magazine. He described the magazine he envisioned to prospective writers as The New York Review of Books crossed with The Economist, disparaging click-obsessed websites like The Daily Beast and saying that in the war for readers, quality would prevail. “Buzz is not what I am looking for,” he said soon after his purchase. If his initial approach to the publication sounded appealing to prospective employees, it seemed surprising to others, including Jacob Weisberg, editor in chief of the Slate Group and a former New Republic employee, who said he had expected Mr. Hughes to make more of a digital push. An even bigger surprise was that Mr. Hughes seemed to think the magazine could be profitable. The New Republic had been losing money for years — its “investors” were effectively philanthropists — and the business climate has never been worse for magazines. As The New Republic’s losses mounted, reaching $5 million a year according to one person with knowledge of its books, Mr. Hughes grew impatient. Mr. Weisberg, who has a home near Mr. Hughes in Garrison, N.Y., suggested that he might think about how much he was willing to lose and hold his staff to the number. “He completely tuned that out,” Mr. Weisberg said. Mr. Hughes began setting aggressive targets for web traffic, and calling for more “snackable content.” He told employees not to use the popular abbreviation “TNR” to refer to the magazine, explaining that “The New Republic” was a more recognizable brand. He started talking about turning The New Republic into a technology company, and proposed new mobile phone applications and notifications for breaking news events. As Mr. Hughes saw it, Mr. Foer was unwilling or unable to articulate a vision for the company’s web strategy. For his part, Mr. Foer felt that Mr. Hughes wasn’t giving him a clear sense of what he wanted. Things were complicated by the fact that the owner and editor had grown close. Mr. Foer was a guest at the small ceremony where Mr. Hughes married the investor and aspiring politician Sean Eldridge. Mr. Hughes gave an affectionate toast at Mr. Foer’s 40th birthday party at his wife’s family’s country house in Pennsylvania. Even as Mr. Hughes was struggling with the future of The New Republic, his husband was facing challenges of his own, running a losing congressional campaign in upstate New York. Mr. Hughes vigorously denies that Mr. Eldridge’s failed bid for Congress had any bearing on his decisions at The New Republic, but people who worked with him at the magazine said he was visibly deflated and dispirited by the experience. Things reached a peak just as the magazine’s 100th anniversary was approaching. To his staff, Mr. Hughes, who had already hired Mr. Vidra and was looking to replace Mr. Foer, seemed conflicted about its 100th birthday gala, a black-tie affair featuring remarks from Bill Clinton. He obsessed over the guest list, and personally handled the seating. At the same time, he told several people at the magazine that he was not interested in sentimentally dwelling on its past. The question now is whether this is all just a particularly tempestuous transition for a magazine with a long history of nasty intellectual infighting, or something more. Mr. Vidra has announced that The New Republic’s next issue will be published in February. Given its depleted masthead and its current reputation among writers, it could be a challenge to fill the pages. On the other hand, Gabriel Snyder, the new editor, is well regarded. And freelance writers are in abundant supply. There’s no rule that tech-mogul takeovers of traditional media companies have to end badly. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has been on a hiring spree at The Washington Post, and the newspaper appears to be thriving, at least journalistically. In all the turmoil, Mr. Hughes  Mr. Vidra, the new chief executive, said that he could have chosen his words better in his early encounters with the staff. But he reiterated the urgent need for change. “This institution needs to thrive on its own,” he said. “It can’t sit back and wait for another benefactor in 30 or 40 years.” Mr. Vidra added that the magazine planned to expand through 2015, both in the newsroom and on the technology side. Michael Kinsley, who did two stints as editor of The New Republic and then rejoined the magazine in 2013 before leaving in January for Vanity Fair, cautioned against rushing to judgment about the new regime. “We don’t know, or at least I don’t know, what their plans are,” he said. “Have they said anything about what they’re going to do except in these vague and cliché-ridden terms?” Mr. Kinsley is no longer on the magazine’s masthead. But if he were, he said, he wouldn’t join the protest. “We live in a capitalistic society, and that’s something that The New Republic has historically stood for,” he went on. “It’s his magazine, and if he wants to wreck it, he can.”
