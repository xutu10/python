'How to Speak Money' Explains the Jargon
“How to Speak Money,” by John Lanchester, explains the jargon of finance — and why it’s important to know the terminology.
===
HERE’S a pop quiz: Can you define the following terms and explain why they are important to your investment portfolio? ■ Dead-cat bounce. ■ Inverted yield curve. ■  If you aren’t a full-fledged investing hound, you may have answered one or more with something like, “I sort of know, I think.” Before the 2008 financial crisis, that response would have been fine, John Lanchester writes in  But in light of all the upheaval since the Great Recession, Mr. Lanchester contends that you need to understand what financial experts mean when they use terms like the ones above. And, more important, you should see if you agree with their analysis of what these situations could mean for your investments. To help you, Mr. Lanchester, a British novelist and journalist, has written what amounts to a clever moneyspeak-to-English dictionary. And, for the most part, he succeeds quite well. The book divides neatly into two parts. He begins by explaining why it’s important to understand financial terminology. From there, he creates a witty glossary. ( Along the way, he sprinkles in fun facts — like the reason Alfred W. Jones, the man credited with creating the first hedge fund, chose to pay himself 20 percent of the fund’s profits. (It was what “Phoenician sea captains paid themselves after a successful voyage.”) That 20 percent figure is now the industry standard, although many managers take 2 percent of the money under management as well. There are whimsical touches throughout. For example, in the glossary he includes “C.R.E.A.M.” This, he notes, is the title of “a song by the Wu-Tang Clan that should be on the required-listening playlist for all who are or want to be in business for themselves.” The title, he adds, is an acronym for “Cash Rules Everything About Me.” All this is entertaining even if you don’t spend most of your day thinking about your finances. Oh, about those terms in the quiz above: A dead-cat bounce is Wall Street shorthand for “an apparent but illusory recovery in a falling market,” Mr. Lanchester writes. “It’s the same kind of bounce a dead cat would give if you chucked it out a window: not a very big one,” he says. “If you’re wondering who on earth would be so sick as to come up with a metaphor like that, greetings and welcome to the world of money.” An inverted yield curve occurs when “things are weird and the economy is hitting hard times,” he explains. When the times are tough, investors sometimes buy significant amounts of long-term debt to lock in higher interest rates, or yield. Thirty-year  But the demand for that long-term debt drives up its price. Since price and yield are inversely correlated, rising prices cause yields to fall. “That can mean the longer-term debts end up with a lower yield than short-term debts” like a one-year Treasury, he writes. The reason that’s “weird,” to use Mr. Lanchester’s word, is that long-term rates should be higher to compensate for the increased time the money is at risk. The aberration, he says, “is a sure sign the market thinks there is severe trouble ahead.” Finally, he says quantitative easing occurs when the government buys back its own debt. (Really, a quasi-independent central bank, like the Federal Reserve, is buying debt issued by the Treasury, which is without question a branch of the government. But Mr. Lanchester likes to keep things simple.) He explains this circular borrowing this way: “There’s no particular benefit to that: It’s like borrowing money from your neighbor and then paying the neighbor back the exact same amount. Nothing has changed. The trick in this case is that the money the government uses to buy back the debt is newly created. It’s money that simply didn’t exist before. It’s like typing 100,000 at a keyboard and magically having $100,000 added to your bank account. Then you use that newly created money to pay off your debts.” Introducing more money is supposed to stimulate the economy. Now you know. For all the appeal of his droll definitions and trenchant commentary, there are a couple of things that the author could have done better. The glossary feels a bit padded. I’m in favor of overcommunicating, but I am not sure he needed to define such things as dividends, life expectancy and socialism. And the book would have benefited from a wider use of simple charts and graphs to better explain some of the terms, like the aforementioned yield curve. But these are small complaints. Mr. Lanchester provides a useful service in an amusing way. And it seems only right to give him the last word: “The bafflement that people feel at the language of money contains a note of outrage — it shouldn’t be this complicated — and a note of self-doubt — I should be able to understand this on my own. Both are misplaced. The language isn’t impossibly complicated, but it isn’t transparent and nobody understands it automatically and innately. Once you learn it though, the world does start to look different.”
