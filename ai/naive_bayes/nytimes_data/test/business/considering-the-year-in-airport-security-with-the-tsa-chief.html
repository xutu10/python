Considering the Year in Airport Security, With the T.S.A. Chief
The number of people who enrolled in programs to expedite passage through security checkpoints rose, John Pistole says, as did the number of guns found during screenings.

IF you grew accustomed to being waved into an expedited security line at the airport this year even though you didn’t belong to the  More than 45 percent of air travelers now move quickly through security by using PreCheck or other so-called risk-based programs. And the T.S.A. says it has enrolled so many travelers in PreCheck, which costs $85 for five years, that it is reducing the numbers of nonmembers being allowed to use those lanes. “As more and more people have signed up for T.S.A. PreCheck, we’re reducing that number and percentage fairly substantially, particularly over the last several months,” said John S. Pistole, the T.S.A. administrator, referring to the large numbers of nonmembers who were directed down the PreCheck lanes this year, sometimes to their own bewilderment. In a wide-ranging interview as he prepared to leave his job on Dec. 31 to become a college president, Mr. Pistole said that more than 725,000 people had paid to join PreCheck, a year after the program was opened for general enrollment. Next year, he said, it is likely that enrollment numbers will grow robustly, because the agency plans to form partnerships with private companies to evaluate applications. Besides PreCheck, fast-pass security is provided through Global Entry, Sentri and Nexis, which provide expedited entry for returning international travelers at airports and borders, as well as similar programs for airline crews, travelers over 75 or under 12, uniformed military members and others. PreCheck lanes are now available at 123 airports.  Some members of Congress have long insisted that the T.S.A. develop more partnerships with private companies. The agency has been working with potential contractors on rules for managing security and protecting personal data, Mr. Pistole said. “I’m hopeful that we will have some more people being enrolled through the third-party private sector, which could expand perhaps next year significantly the numbers. Instead of hundreds of thousands it may literally be in the millions — which we would then need to accommodate by increasing even more the number of T.S.A. PreCheck lanes,” he said. Currently, about 500 of the total 2,200 T.S.A. security lanes at commercial airports are designated either full time or part time for PreCheck. Still, since the agency claims great success already with the way it has introduced PreCheck, why then turn to private contractors to take part in processing, especially given concerns about potential abuse or commercial exploitation of personal data collected and stored in the required background checks?In other words, why fix what isn’t broken? “What I see with the third parties — and it clearly is not broken; it’s working well — is, can third-party enrollment be a game-changer for the checkpoint of the future?” he responded. “Can we can do it in a partnership with the private sector in ways that go beyond our ability, because we have a reduced budget?” he said. We’ll be hearing a lot more about these proposed third-party initiatives next year, but let me summarize a few more of Mr. Pistole’s comments about the T.S.A., a once widely reviled agency whose public image, in my opinion, has been significantly improved in the four and a half years that Mr. Pistole has been the chief. He said that rules restricting carrying liquids through security would eventually be relaxed as more efficient technology is developed to quickly identify the chemical nature of substances in containers. “The initial ban back in ’06 with that terrorist plot in the U.K. was seen as being temporary, until the technology and procedures could be improved” to efficiently identify substances without creating long backups at security, he said. “But that’s a long-term goal, not in the near future.” On the other hand, as the holiday season approaches, the T.S.A. has become more relaxed about snow globes. Images in past years of a security screener confiscating Frosty the Snowman as a child wailed might have made for amusing chiding of the T.S.A., but liquid explosives are the threat that most worries  At the same time, as Mr. Pistole plans to move on to a job as president of his alma mater,  Unauthorized gun carriers can be arrested, depending on laws in some localities and states. All are fined by the T.S.A., he said. In an era in which more Americans routinely carry firearms, airport gun toters almost always claim that they had simply forgotten about the guns in their bags. Or in some cases, on their belts, as with a 94-year-old man who, a T.S.A. report on Friday said, “attempted to enter the T.S.A. checkpoint at La Guardia with a loaded .38-caliber revolver clipped to his belt in the small of his back on Wednesday.” Mr. Pistole, a former F.B.I. agent, had this advice: “Before you pack, think about what you’re packing.”
