Weinstein Company Loses Dispute Over Profits to ‘Hobbit’
Bob and Harvey Weinstein had sought at least $75 million in compensation from sequels to “The Hobbit.”

LOS ANGELES – An attempt by Bob and Harvey Weinstein to profit from the second and third “Hobbit” movies has failed. A New York arbitrator, Bernard J. Fried, on Friday rejected a claim by the Weinstein brothers that sought at least $75 million in compensation from “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,” released last year, and the coming “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.” The decision,  Warner Bros., which controls the movie franchise, gave the brothers part of the proceeds from the 2012 film “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.” That payment was made in accordance with an agreement under which the Weinsteins sold film rights to J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth fantasies before founding their current studio, the Weinstein Company. But the brothers filed a lawsuit last year in New York state court saying that they were also owed similar profits from the sequels. Warner declined to comment on Friday beyond a statement released in response to the initial lawsuit. The Weinsteins, that statement said, committed “one of the great blunders in movie history” by entering into a contract that only gave them a stake in one film. “They agreed to be paid only on the first motion picture based on ‘The Hobbit.’ And that’s all they’re owed.” A Weinstein spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.
