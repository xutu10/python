Kickstarter Campaign Focuses on Public Radio
An appeal from the public media company PRX to fund its podcast network Radiotopia comes as new attention is being focused on podcasts.

A Kickstarter campaign offering backers the opportunity to participate in “remaking public radio” through podcasts raised $620,412 by the time it ended Friday, making it the most-funded radio or podcast project on the crowdfunding site. Just over 21,800 backers contributed to the appeal from the public media company PRX to fund its podcast network Radiotopia, which includes programs from Roman Mars (“99% Invisible”), the Kitchen Sisters (“Fugitive Waves”) and Joe Richman (“Radio Diaries”), among others. The successful appeal comes as new attention is being focused on podcasts, after the popularity this fall of “Serial,” which takes listeners inside the journalist Sarah Koenig’s investigation into a 1999 murder. The weekly podcast, which is at the top of Apple’s iTunes podcast list, comes from the creators of the public radio mainstay “This American Life” and is produced by WBEZ Chicago. The radio journalist Alex Blumberg, a “This American Life” veteran and co-founder of “Planet Money,” is also raising funds for a new commercial podcasting network and documenting the process in his own podcast called “StartUp.” A decade after podcasting began, the medium’s audience, distribution, revenue and content are finally coming together, said Jake Shapiro, the chief executive of PRX. “All of us are feeling like we’re at the beginning of a flourishing new ecosystem around podcasts,” he said. “It has these really important roots in public radio but the shape of it is a new system,” he added. Radiotopia has focused on voices and formats that do not always find a place on traditional public radio. The Kickstarter money will support new episodes of its existing podcasts, as well as subsidized health care and raises for the staff of “99% Invisible,” Radiotopia’s lead program, which looks at architecture and design. Four new podcasts will also join the network, three of them hosted by women. The lack of female voices in podcasting has been “a gap,” Mr. Shapiro said. “It was very important to help address that in Radiotopia,” he added. A portion of the money will also go to a pilot development fund to find new podcast producers and hosts. “We want to be another bridge to rising talent,” Mr. Shapiro said. “It’s a leap of faith to commit to doing your own show.”
