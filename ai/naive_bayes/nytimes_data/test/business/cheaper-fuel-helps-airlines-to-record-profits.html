Cheaper Fuel Helps Airlines to Record Profits
The recent slide in crude oil prices contributed to soaring third-quarter revenue for the biggest airlines.

DALLAS —  Saving a nickel or a dime per gallon might not seem like much to the average motorist, but for airlines that use hundreds of millions of gallons of fuel every month, it adds up quickly. Profits are soaring at the biggest airlines, and some of the credit goes to those savings at the pump. Heading into the busy holiday travel period, the airlines expect to see even cheaper fuel prices, thanks to a recent slide in crude oil prices. Continued strong travel demand is also allowing airlines to push fares higher, and there are no signs that Ebola is scaring away travelers. The results were there to see Thursday, as several leading airlines reported financial results for the third quarter, which included the end of the heavy summer vacation travel season. The world’s biggest airline operator, American Airlines, earned a $942 million profit in the third quarter, which runs from June through September. The company said it was its biggest profit ever for a quarter, and it was an 87 percent increase over the amount that American and US Airways earned separately last year before their December 2013 merger. Doug Parker, the airline’s chief executive, predicted more records for fourth-quarter and full-year earnings. United Continental posted net income of $924 million, up from $379 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, its adjusted profit was a record $1.1 billion. Southwest profit rose 27 percent to $329 million. All three companies beat Wall Street expectations for earnings. United cut its fuel bill by $135 million compared with last year’s third quarter, a reduction of 4.1 percent on its largest single expense. Southwest saved $64 million, or 4.4 percent, on fuel compared with last year — and the savings are likely to increase. The airline predicted that it would pay $2.70 to $2.75 per gallon in the fourth quarter. Airlines could share that windfall with passengers in the form of cheaper tickets, but that does not look likely, at least not yet. The big airlines just pushed through a modest fare increase on domestic routes even though oil prices have fallen by about one-fifth since the last such fare increase back in April. Recent mergers have reduced competition and helped the airlines limit the number of flights, making it easier to increase fares. The four largest airlines in the United States sold at least 83 percent of their seats in the third quarter. A decade ago, more than a quarter of seats went empty. Southwest is one of the few airlines that reports details on fares. Its average one-way price inched higher, to $160.74, an increase of $1.35 over the same time last year but up nearly $50 in the last five years, a period in which mergers reduced the number of competitors and fuel prices rose. American, which does not give fare figures, said that the amount passengers paid to fly each mile, a figure called yield in the airline business, set a record. Airline investors were worried by the appearance of the first cases in the United States of the deadly Ebola virus, especially the news this month that a nurse had flown on two Frontier Airlines flights shortly before testing positive. That fear started to subside last week when the chief executive of Delta Air Lines expressed confidence that authorities would prevent an outbreak at home. On Thursday, United officials said that they saw no indication that Ebola was affecting bookings. While not addressing Ebola, the chief of Southwest, Gary Kelly, said his airline’s trend toward higher revenue had continued into October, and bookings for November and December looked good. JetBlue Airways, which is about to change C.E.O.s, reported net income of $79 million. Its earnings and revenue both fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Alaska Air’s earnings topped Wall Street forecasts.
