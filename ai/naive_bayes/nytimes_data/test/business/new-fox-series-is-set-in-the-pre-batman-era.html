New Fox Series Is Set in the Pre-Batman Era
The new Fox drama “Gotham,” set in Batman’s city when Bruce Wayne was a boy, relies heavily on visual effects to create a setting out of time and place.

The star of “ Nor is it really Jim Gordon, the longtime police ally of that superhero. Gordon, a young, yet-to-be-disillusioned detective played by Ben McKenzie, is the central character, but he’s not the star. The star is in the title: Gotham, the city, the visually arresting urban world of darkness and menace first created by comic book artists in the 1940s, and reimagined often since, is the raison d’être of this Fox drama, which will have its premiere Monday night. While much of network television continues to aspire to solving crimes or medical cases, “Gotham” means only to go up against expectations set by a raft of huge-budget (and recently well-reviewed) Hollywood movies, expectations preserved in the pulsating hearts of a rabid core of Batman fanboys (and fangirls) worldwide. Hopes are also high for Fox, which sprang leaks last season and needs the kind of jolt a breakout hit can provide. One indication of the challenge was apparent last week outside the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, where a line of lucky contest-winning Batman fans, most decked out in gear bearing the familiar bat signal, snaked around the block as they breathlessly anticipated a first crack at seeing the “Gotham” pilot. Shot completely in New York, “Gotham” is really set in a city out of place and time. The ambience is New York in the 1970s, but characters use computers and carry cellphones. Their clothes could be from the 1950s. And the buildings, in sweeping shots designed by the Emmy-nominated television director Danny Cannon, look more like edifices from the 1930s, or even longer ago. Mr. Cannon, known for series like “CSI” and “Nikita,” insisted on helicopter shots that would swoop in off the Hudson River at low altitude, “using a longer lens so I could get more inside the city,” as he put it. But he also added an extra touch to enhance the illusion of matching the style of comic book frames. Relying on the visual effects department, he said, “I replaced a lot of the buildings with more Dickensian London-style buildings.” He went through photo books of old London, lifted images and had them woven into his shots of the contemporary New York skyline. “So it’s New York in style,” Mr. Cannon said, “but at the same time, there’s something old and broken about it.” The result is a show, like “Game of Thrones” on HBO, that is defined by — and dependent on — a landscape that recalls reality but heightens it at every turn. “It’s a kind of fantasy world, an imagined world where anything is possible,” said Bruno Heller, one of the show’s creators and executive producers. “It can’t be quotidian and prosaic. It has to be limitless and epic.” The idea Mr. Heller hatched — chiefly with Geoff Johns, the chief creative officer of DC Comics, and Peter Roth, president of the Warner Bros. television studio — was to take the show away from “the capes and masks and people flying.” He explained: “Way better writers have dealt with these characters. You can’t simply draw the characters they all know and look to simply present that. You have to bring something fresh to it.” That’s why they decided to put Jim Gordon in the middle of the story, brought into the eventual mythic struggle by the investigation into the murders of Bruce Wayne’s parents. “It’s all very pre-costume,” Mr. Johns said. “This is a timeline in Gotham’s history that has not really been explored that much. Jim Gordon is an honest cop. Well, how did he rise to become commissioner in such a corrupt city?” Familiar characters abound, but not in their fully realized personae. Catwoman (Camren Bicondova) is just a witness on the fringes of the pilot. The Riddler (Cory Michael Smith) does more or less a cameo. But Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue) is heavily involved as Gordon’s corrupt (mostly) partner, while the Penguin (Robin Lord Taylor) gets a star turn as a nascent villain. (Jada Pinkett Smith plays a new, colorful, scene-chewing baddie named Fish Mooney.) Bruce Wayne, meanwhile, is played by 13-year-old David Mazouz (seen previously in the Fox series “Touch”). At the start, his parents’ case is central, but the future Batman exists mainly to inspire Gordon’s noble campaign to clean up the city. In the short term, “Gotham” will be a hybrid of sorts, said Dana Walden, who with her longtime partner at the Fox television production studio, Gary Newman, took over the top programming job at the Fox network in July. Some episodes will play like procedurals. “But even in those episodes, the villains and the story points will feel unique,” she said. Mr. Newman noted that the initial season would consist of only 15 episodes, running largely straight through without breaks this fall, a schedule more familiar to cable television but one that will underscore the serial elements of the show. As the story progresses, it will increasingly emphasize “the epic saga,” Mr. Heller said. “How did this world evolve into the world of Batman?” That may mean some glimpses of those capes and masks, at least on the dark side, he said, adding, “Gotham is a world where even at this stage, villains are somewhat theatrical.” It may be wise for viewers to  But Mr. Heller, Mr. Cannon and Mr. Johns all emphasized that “Gotham” aimed to be a more visually arresting kind of television, promising that the striking look of the pilot would be maintained. “For a lot of young people, their first experience with great visual beauty is not from art galleries or movies but from comic books,” Mr. Heller said. “The Batman world, more so than Metropolis of Superman or the Marvel Comics, is a through line from the Grimms’ fairy tales. “It is literally a Gothic world. So it has a kind of mythic resonance beyond itself.”
