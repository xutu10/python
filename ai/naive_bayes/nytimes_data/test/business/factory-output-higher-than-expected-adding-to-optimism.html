Factory Output Higher Than Expected, Adding to Optimism
Upbeat factory data joined bullish employment and retail sales reports in suggesting strength in the economy, even as growth in the fourth quarter is expected to moderate sharply.

WASHINGTON —  Manufacturing output recorded its largest increase in nine months in November as production expanded across the board, pointing to underlying strength in the economy. Factory production rose 1.1 percent after advancing 0.4 percent in October, the Federal Reserve said on Monday. Overall industrial production, which includes mining and utilities output as well as manufacturing, rose by 1.3 percent in November, the largest increase since May 2010, as demand for utilities rose. “There is little evidence here that weaker global growth or a stronger dollar has hurt U.S. manufacturing,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. The upbeat factory data joined bullish employment and retail sales reports in suggesting strength in the economy, even as growth in the fourth quarter is expected to moderate sharply after two back-to-back quarters of robust expansion. Wall Street had expected manufacturing output to rise only 0.5 percent in November. The United States remains a bright spot in a troubled global economy. Growth has slowed in China and the eurozone, and Japan has slipped back into recession. But optimism over American manufacturing was tempered somewhat by a New York Federal Reserve report showing its Empire State general business conditions index contracted in December for the first time since January 2013. Economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the weak report, noting the survey was volatile because of limited factory activity in New York State. “With all the discussion about the impact of lower oil prices, it may feel like this miss is a warning that the factory sector is retrenching,” said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities. “We are not convinced that is what the numbers are telling us.” Another report showed that homebuilder sentiment ebbed in December, though builders remained more optimistic than in the first half of the year. The reports came a day before Federal Reserve officials gather for a two-day meeting to assess the economy’s health and deliberate on monetary policy. Economists expect the Fed to open the door a bit wider to interest rate increases next year after the recent run of bullish data. Manufacturing output in November was led by a 5.1 percent jump in automobile production after three straight months of decline. There were also solid gains in machinery, apparel and leather, and petroleum and coal products. Mining output slipped 0.1 percent. Utilities production jumped 5.1 percent as a cold snap increased demand for utilities, prompting the forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers to raise its fourth-quarter growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.6 percent annual rate. The amount of manufacturing capacity in use last month rose to its highest since December 2007. Overall industrial capacity use hit its highest level in more than six and a half years. “This could be seen as an indication of accelerating resource slack absorption in the U.S. economy,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities. Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use as a signal of how much so-called slack remains in the economy and how much room there is for growth to run before it becomes inflationary.
