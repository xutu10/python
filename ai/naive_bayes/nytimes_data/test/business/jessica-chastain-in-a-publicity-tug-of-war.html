Jessica Chastain in a Publicity Tug of War
A publicity scuffle over Jessica Chastain, who appears in both “Interstellar” and “A Most Violent Year,” exemplifies how actors and filmmakers occasionally face conflicts over overlapping films.

LOS ANGELES —  Take a good look when  It will be one of the rare times she can promote the film, an indie crime drama, through the hottest weeks of this year’s awards season — at least if the makers of “Interstellar” have their way. In a behind-the-scenes scuffle that pits a very big movie, Christopher Nolan’s  That is because Mr. Nolan and others, for the most part, are enforcing an agreement that says she cannot campaign for any film but Mr. Nolan’s from early October through early December, with the exception of her appearance at the premiere on Thursday, according to people briefed on the dispute. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject for both sides. Speaking on Wednesday from Washington, where she is on a press tour for “Interstellar,” Ms. Chastain declined to talk specifically about the blackout. “I never comment about my contracts or my salary,” she said. But she noted that Mr. Nolan had personally helped her get out of an appearance on “The Late Show With David Letterman” so she could attend the premiere for “A Most Violent Year.” Actors and filmmakers occasionally must face conflicts created by overlapping films, and this year Ms. Chastain has also been juggling “The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby,” “Salomé” and “Miss Julie.” “We all put our heads together and do what we can,” she said. The current conflict, according to those who described it, escalated as it became apparent that Ms. Chastain, who plays a scientist struggling to save humanity in “Interstellar,” might also be an awards contender for her performance in “A Most Violent Year.” In Mr. Chandor’s film, a tale of corruption set in 1981 New York, she plays the ferocious, mob-connected wife of a struggling  Under a deal struck long ago with the makers of “Interstellar,” Ms. Chastain, who has often juggled films in the past — in 2011 she had six, including “The Help” and “The Tree of Life” — is supposed to focus on only the Nolan film for another month. For stars, hitting the publicity trail is a decades-old practice, and for studios it is a standard, and essential, piece of marketing strategy. Initially, Mr. Chandor and his backers — Participant Media and the independent distributor A24 — believed that Ms. Chastain, while blocked from media appearances, would be allowed to attend the screenings and get-togethers that are de rigueur for those seeking  On that assumption, they arranged to release “A Most Violent Year” in a small number of theaters on Dec. 31, to qualify it for awards in 2015, with a wider opening to follow. But Mr. Nolan and his backers have insisted that Ms. Chastain’s contract forbids even those semiprivate encounters and have not given in to pleas from Mr. Chandor, A24 and others for a waiver. Next week, however, she will be permitted to attend a private tastemakers’ screening at the Creative Artists Agency here. Ms. Chastain did respond to some questions about “A Most Violent Year” and other projects while speaking to Golden Globes voters about “Interstellar,” according to people briefed on that session. They said that she also addressed questions about the smaller film during media interviews, particularly while abroad. Paramount Pictures, which is distributing “Interstellar” in the United States, and Warner Bros., which is releasing it abroad, declined to comment, as did representatives for Mr. Chandor and A24. Kelly Bush, who represents Mr. Nolan, also did not comment. Lionsgate has also been squeezed by “Interstellar.” Its “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1” will have no Imax screenings when it opens on Nov. 21, as the needed screens are committed to Mr. Nolan’s film. “A Most Violent Year” cost about $20 million to make. And, like Mr. Chandor’s earlier films, “Margin Call” and “All Is Lost,” its promotion will depend more heavily on publicity than on advertising. By contrast, “Interstellar” cost about $165 million and will be backed by a large ad budget. Mr. Isaac is clearly the lead actor in “A Most Violent Year.” But Ms. Chastain, who has two Oscar nominations, is the better-known performer. She is expected to help promote “A Most Violent Year” in mid-January, after a European film shoot. By then, however, deadlines for nominations for key film awards — including the Oscars, for which nominating ballots must be cast by Jan. 8 — will have passed.
