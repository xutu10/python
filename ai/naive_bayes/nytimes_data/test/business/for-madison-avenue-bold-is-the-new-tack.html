For Madison Avenue, ‘Bold’ Is the New Tack 
No matter the category, whether autos, clothing, jewelry, makeup, packaged food or plumbing fixtures, “bold” is going where the word has not gone before.

FORTUNE, the saying goes, favors the bold, and so it seems does Madison Avenue. The word “bold” has grown increasingly popular among marketers for a panoply of products, turning up frequently in advertising on television, in print, online and in social media. No matter the category, whether autos, clothing, jewelry, makeup, packaged food or plumbing fixtures, “bold” is boldly — er, um, make that confidently and assertively — going where the word has not gone before. A campaign for the 2015 Toyota Camry includes print ads that carry the headline “The bold new Camry” and the theme “One bold choice leads to another.” In  And ads for True Religion jeans urge men and women to “Be so bold,” a line that doubles as a hashtag. An  Also, magazine ads for New York Brand Texas Toast croutons propose, “Live a big, bold, flavor-filled life.” The Kraft Foods Group sells a line of meats named Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh Bold cold cuts. And a campaign for the Kohler brand of faucets and other fixtures asks homeowners to consider “The bold look of Kohler.” Some uses of the B-word seem baffling. For instance, signs in the windows of Santander banks offer potential customers “bold rates” on business lines of credit. And just what is it that makes Movado Bold watches bold? The textured dials? The accents in bright colors like orange and lime green? Also puzzling is that the proliferation of “bold” comes a year or so after Procter & Gamble discontinued selling in the United States a brand of detergent called Bold. (The detergent, which was introduced in 1965 and absorbed a sibling brand, Solo, in 1993, is still available in other parts of the world.) For Camry, “the ‘bold’ positioning is about making a statement with the style of the vehicle,” said John Lisko, executive communications director at the Toyota creative agency Saatchi & Saatchi, part of the Publicis Groupe, so that the sedan “will appeal to a broader audience than it typically did.” Camry, which has long had an image as a staid, safe choice,  There is “not just a ‘bold’ message” in the ads, Mr. Lisko said, but also in “part of the media plan.” For example, a full-page “Bold new Camry” ad appears in the premiere issue of a print magazine that has been  “We’ve been seeing ‘bold’ used a lot lately, too,” said Mark Fortner, a co-founder of an automotive enthusiast website,  Mr. Fortner added: “However, saying your product is ‘bold’ could be similar to saying it’s ‘cool’ or ‘edgy,’ when in fact consumers might disagree. Describing something like a color, for example, as ‘bold’ can work well.” Richard Kirshenbaum, chief executive of the Nue Studio Group, which owns a boutique agency, NSG/Swat, agreed. “I don’t think it’s bad, but there’s a cheese factor when you’re so overt: ‘I want to target you, the bold person,’ ” he said, “and an element of trying to flatter someone. Being bold is wonderful, as is making bold moves in one’s career, but I would rather demonstrate it than say it.” Darren Tristano, executive vice president of Technomic, a food industry research and consultancy firm in Chicago, offered another reason for the boom in “bold,” linking it to a major trend in his bailiwick: “increasing the flavor profiles” of restaurant menu items and food sold in supermarkets “to be bolder.” “The younger generation is looking for spicier, bolder flavors, and boomers, as they age and their palates get weaker in terms of tasting flavors, are looking for that, too,” Mr. Tristano said. “Bold flavors are a way to differentiate and give customers choices.” Last month, Pizza Hut and the Deutsch L.A. agency introduced  The ardor for “bold” is another example of a tendency among creative executives on Madison Avenue to go mad for a certain word or phrase, which then seems to become omnipresent. “Hello” has also been popular of late, as in “ And several brands, among them Burger King, Gap Kids and Olay, have been using themes and headlines that begin with “ The reason “the same words or phrases keep recurring in marketing communications,” said Andreas Combuechen, chief executive of Atmosphere Proximity in New York, “all comes down to the fact we’re all creating in a connected world. “No topic is local or even regional anymore, as social media has made every conversation global,” he added. “Today, a trending hashtag equals a homogenized culture where influential ideas seamlessly flow not just across borders but across brands.”
