Guardrail Tests Went Unreported, Court Hears
Trinity Industries says they did not reveal failed crash tests for a guardrail, because that particular style was never used. Plaintiffs, however, claim it is very similar to those in use.

Trinity Industries The case is being brought under the False Claims Act by Joshua Harman, a competitor who discovered that Trinity had changed the design of its ET-Plus rail head in 2005 without notifying the Federal Highway Administration, as federal rules require. The redesigned guardrail has prompted safety concerns not just because of the federal lawsuit, but because states including Missouri and Massachusetts, conducting their own inquiries, banned the design last month. Virginia also raised concerns, and in a sternly worded letter to Trinity last Friday said that it did not believe the company had conducted adequate testing of the ET-Plus. Virginia wants more testing done. Trinity has said that the failure to disclose the changes was accidental, and that it does not believe the guardrail poses a safety hazard. The federal agency has so far accepted Trinity’s explanation, and it said that the crash tests it reviewed in 2012 led it to determine the guardrails were eligible for federal reimbursement. But on Tuesday and Wednesday in Texas federal court, plaintiffs revealed that Trinity and its research partner, the Texas Transportation Institute, had conducted additional tests of a modified ET-Plus in 2005 and 2006, which were also never disclosed to federal officials. Brian Smith, a Trinity executive, testified Tuesday afternoon that the five failed tests were not reported, even after what are said to be problems with the ET-Plus came to light two years ago. Trinity has defended its actions by saying that the five tests were only an experiment to see whether ET-Plus guardrails with a more “flared” design would work. The company said the flared guardrail was “never manufactured, sold or installed” on roadways. In a statement, Trinity said the redesigned guardrail was “purely a research and development project and was never submitted to the Federal Highway Administration for acceptance.” The plaintiffs, however, assert that since the five failed tests used the same ET-Plus rail head as those in use across the country, Trinity deliberately chose to hide the results from regulators. On Wednesday, Roger Bligh, a research engineer at the Texas Transportation Institute, which conducted the crash tests for Trinity, was also asked about the tests. He said that even after he met with the government’s lead engineer on the ET-Plus inquiry, Nicholas Artimovich, he never mentioned there had been another set of tests involving the same guardrail head. Mr. Bligh called the five failed tests only part of an “R.&D.; product.” On Wednesday, the agency, when asked if the testimony had affected its view of the guardrails, said it was “taking action to get to the bottom of this issue in the interest of public safety.” Guardrails work by collapsing when struck head-on, absorbing the impact of a vehicle to help prevent injuries. Additionally, a flat piece of steel at the front of the guardrail, known as a rail head, is supposed to slide along the rail itself, pushing the metal safely out of the way. In 2005, Trinity narrowed the channel behind the rail head, which critics say can cause it to jam and push the rail itself into the vehicle — potentially injuring the occupants. This week’s trial is actually the second go-round for Mr. Harman and Trinity. An earlier trial ended abruptly in a mistrial over a dispute over whether Trinity had tried to intimidate a safety expert. Mr. Bligh was also questioned about the initial testing for the redesigned ET-Plus that was submitted to the federal government in 2005. When asked by lawyers for Mr. Harman why any mention of the rail head’s narrower design was left out of his report, Mr. Bligh said that “we made a mistake and that was left out.”
