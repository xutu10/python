LOS ANGELES —  Two years after  Lions Gate and Stephenie Meyer, the creator of the vampires-and-werewolves “Twilight” saga, on Tuesday announced plans to select five aspiring female directors to make short films based on “Twilight” characters. The mini-movies, financed by Lions Gate and its production partners, will be shown exclusively on Facebook next year. “We think Facebook is a great way for us to introduce the world of ‘Twilight’ to a whole new audience while re-energizing existing fans,” Michael Burns, Lions Gate’s vice chairman, said in an interview. The effort reflects the manner in which Hollywood is maintaining its most valuable film properties between sequels and prequels and remakes. In the past, studios barely kept a pilot light lit, forcing marketing teams to constantly reactivate cold fan bases. Now the savviest studio marketers are using Facebook, Tumblr, YouTube and other online platforms to keep fans on a constant low boil. “This is the just the beginning — a template, if you will,” Mr. Burns added. “You can probably guess what might be coming next.” A similar short film series based on “The Hunger Games,” Lions Gate’s other  While fans salivate over his tease, Hollywood will no doubt focus on the Facebook component. What it signals seems clear: The social media service can be more than a platform for movie trailers. Its future may well include the distribution of entire movies. The entertainment industry is enticed by that proposition because Facebook attracts such a giant audience: 1.3 billion monthly users worldwide. Movie companies are increasingly exploring nontraditional distribution of all kinds. On Monday, the Weinstein Company announced a deal to  Lions Gate has a history of novel Facebook partnerships. The studio created a teaser for “Divergent” in December that became the service’s  Facebook declined to make an executive available for an interview for this article. In a statement, Dan Rose, the Facebook vice president for partnerships, said Lions Gate’s “premium video program” was a “great opportunity” to engage the 150 million people who followed the official “Twilight” Facebook pages. Even so, Chris Cox, the Facebook chief product officer, said in an interview in September that exclusive video or original content, like the new TV-length shows commissioned by Yahoo, were not a focus for the social network. “It’s really how do we make the experience when you’re there amazing, more relevant and more joyful,” he said. “If you’re solving those sorts of problems, it’s not on your road map to go get exclusive content to get more people to come back to Facebook. One day, maybe, but not right now.” The short film series, called “The Storytellers — New Creative Voices of ‘The Twilight Saga,’ ” has the backing of  A group of female panelists, including the “Twilight” actress Kristen Stewart and Ms. Meyer, will select the winning shorts and mentor participants, Lions Gate said. Other panelists include the actresses Kate Winslet, Octavia Spencer and Julie Bowen; Catherine Hardwicke, who directed the first “Twilight” movie; the film producer Cathy Schulman; and Jennifer Lee, who co-directed “Frozen.” Certain contest details, including the length of the shorts, are still being worked out and will be made available on  Ms. Meyer’s four “Twilight” books have sold more than 120 million copies worldwide. The five resulting films — the final book, “Breaking Dawn,” was told in two cinematic parts — took in $3.5 billion worldwide, after accounting for inflation. The participation of Ms. Meyer in the new “Twilight” project carries extra weight. In 2012, when the last movie was released, Lions Gate was  In a statement, Ms. Meyer said nothing specific about returning to “Twilight” but instead focused on Hollywood’s gender gap. “The female voice is something that has become more and more important to me as I’ve worked in the film industry,” she said.
