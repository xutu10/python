Energy Mergers Born of a Production Boom
Many mergers and acquisitions have come from traditional natural gas producers looking to diversify into the oil sector, which has been revived by fracking technology.

For decades, American  “If you go back five years, the U.S. onshore was viewed as very mature, with limited upside,” said Stephen Trauber, global head of energy banking at Citigroup. “To the extent there was growth in the U.S., it was in the Gulf of Mexico. But with the development of fracking technology and horizontal drilling, the reserves that were in the U.S. have been unlocked.” As a number of mergers and acquisitions in recent months demonstrate, energy company executives say they believe that the shale revolution is here to stay. “The industry is in the midst of a significant transformation as companies position themselves to be able to develop and exploit unconventional resources,” said Rob McCeney, a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers’ energy practice. The most recent such deal came in late September, when the German engineering conglomerate Siemens agreed to pay more than $6 billion for Dresser-Rand, a Houston-based maker of equipment used for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Siemens already produces some products for the oil industry. But its deal for Dresser-Rand will expand its offerings markedly and is an acknowledgment that the United States is indeed what Siemens’s chief executive, Joe Kaeser, has said is “the place to be for oil and gas.” Though overall deal volumes this year are down from the previous several years, they remain higher than they were a decade ago, according to Dealogic. Many of the mergers and acquisitions have come from traditional natural gas producers that are looking to diversify into the oil sector, which has been revived thanks to fracking technology. “Companies that have been more focused on gas have refocused their capital allocation and M.&A.; emphasis and are looking to diversify into more oil production,” said Grant Porter, Barclays’s chairman of global natural resources investment banking. Similarly, some traditional oil companies have looked to diversify into the natural gas industry. The biggest such move came in 2009, when Exxon Mobil paid $31 billion for XTO, a big natural gas producer. But other major oil companies like Chevron, Shell and BP have not followed suit with such megadeals, instead taking smaller stakes in and forging partnerships with smaller companies. “There was a view a few years ago that the acquisition activity was going to be the majors taking over the independents, but we haven’t seen that at all,” Mr. McCeney said. That is because “being smaller, entrepreneurial, has afforded the independent companies the opportunity to be successful,” he said. That means that companies like Linn Energy and Devon Energy, two independent oil and gas producers, have thrived in recent years, acquiring smaller rivals while avoiding being taken over. In November, Devon struck one of the biggest energy deals of the last year, paying $6 billion for the GeoSouthern Energy Corporation, a collection of oil-producing assets in the Eagle Ford shale formation in Texas. GeoSouthern was backed by the  “There’s been a lot of activity by sponsor-backed companies,” Mr. McCeney said, referring to private equity firms. “As those companies come online and reach scale, they’re going to be ripe for takeovers.” Another major focus of energy mergers and acquisitions has been the development and consolidation of the pipelines needed to transport the enormous new quantities of oil and gas being produced around the United States. Several so-called midstream companies, consisting mainly of pipeline groups, have gone public as master limited partnerships, tax-advantaged partnerships that grow through further mergers. Kinder Morgan, Enterprise Products, Energy Transfer Partners and Plains All American Pipeline have all become multibillion-dollar companies by gobbling up competitors. But many of these groups have grown up as regional concerns. Now industry watchers think they are poised for several deals to gain scale and access to additional cash needed for costly new projects. “There’s been a tremendous amount of midstream activity,” Mr. Trauber said. “Now you’re starting to see consolidation. Companies are becoming bigger and projects need more capital.” The boom in United States oil and gas production has reshaped the landscape for energy mergers and acquisitions, just as it continues to exert pressure on the global energy markets, even in the face of wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. “From a supply standpoint, the oil markets have been somewhat soft lately in spite of some geopolitical problems,” Mr. Porter said. “Normally when you see this geopolitical pressure you would see prices rise. The fact that they haven’t is primarily because of the growth in U.S. production.”
