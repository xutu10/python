ABC Evening Newscast Overtakes NBC in Ratings
In total viewers and in a key demographic, the ABC newscast came in first, something that hadn’t happened in more than six years.

Riding ratings momentum — and a consistent approach to news — across most of its programs, ABC News broke through in the evening newscast competition last week. It finished first in all the important audience categories, beating NBC News for the first time in more than six years. ABC had been edging ahead of NBC in the newscast competition more regularly among viewers ages 25 to 54 — the group that drives most advertising sales for news programs. But NBC’s newscast had maintained a lead among total viewers — and in a younger category of viewers ages 18 to 49. That changed last week, when ABC’s newscast had 8.41 million total viewers, compared with 8.25 million for NBC. ABC also edged NBC in the 18-49 category and won in the 25-54 group for a ninth straight week. That trend started when Diane Sawyer was still the lead anchor and has continued since David Muir replaced her on Sept. 1. In 2012, ABC also ended a long winning streak for NBC in the morning when its “Good Morning America” toppled the “Today” show.
