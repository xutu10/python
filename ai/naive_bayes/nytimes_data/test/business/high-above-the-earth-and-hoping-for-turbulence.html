High Above the Earth, Hoping for Turbulence
Tagging along on a test flight to show off a new radar system for evaluating bad weather from the cockpit.
===
NORMALLY, pilots are happy to keep thunderstorms at a good distance, but that wasn’t the case on board a twin-engine Convair 540 turboprop airplane that I took a demonstration flight in last month. Up in the cockpit, 21,000 feet above Texas, Markus Johnson and Joe Duval were actually looking for trouble in the form of bad weather. No such luck. We took off from Dallas Love Field on a beautiful late-summer afternoon when trouble was evidently on holiday. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Duval, chief test pilots for Honeywell Aerospace, were showing off a new Honeywell radar system for more easily evaluating bad weather from the cockpit — but the only disturbances to be seen on the radar that afternoon were two weak side-by-side storm cells trying to build over the Gulf of Mexico more than 250 miles to the south. That’s where they pointed the airplane. Back in the cabin, in a crush of electronic gear and military-grade seats, Bill Lusk studied the new Honeywell IntuVue radar display on an overhead screen. Mr. Lusk, a pilot, is manager of daily operations for Southwest Airlines, which is installing the Honeywell system on new 737s. The system is also being used now on 2,000 planes at airlines around the world, Honeywell says. “It’s dissipating, which is not to say it won’t build again,” Mr. Lusk said appraisingly of the larger of the storms as the Convair droned southeast toward the coast. After a while, when we were about 200 miles closer to the gulf, he looked out the window, which of course is something pilots always do, whatever the technology glowing from the instrument display. As the radar showed, the larger storm cell had weakened, but then had re-formed and grown a top like a giant end table. “That’s now about 30,000 feet,” Mr. Lusk said, squinting into the hazy distance. Up in the cockpit not long afterward, the pilots were studying the two storms visually as well as consulting the radar. “It’s small but significant now at 35,000 feet,” Mr. Duval said of the larger one. “We watched it build up from about 5,000 feet,” Mr. Johnson added, taking off his earphones to point out the storm cell and its weaker cousin a bit to the east. Turning left, the plane cut a smooth path between the two brewing storms, swung out over the gulf, and then, with a shrug from Mr. Johnson, headed back toward Dallas. That afternoon at least, storm chasing had been a bust. “That’s probably the only tiger we’re going to see today,” Gregory C. Schauder, the director of Honeywell’s radar safety and information management, said with a trace of disappointment back in the cabin. Three hours after takeoff, we landed back at sun-drenched Love Field, where the test pilots shut down their beloved 1952-vintage Convair, which they were to fly to Florida the next day for another road show for the radar system they had helped develop. Honeywell’s  On the tarmac, I wished the Honeywell pilots a good trip East. “I hope you have bad weather,” I added. Then I headed across town to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, where my flight home to Tucson was delayed by 90 minutes, despite the splendid weather all across the western half of the continent. That was a bit of a puzzle to me. New technology on the ground and in the airplane  Yet delays are nevertheless increasing. This year through July, 22.5 percent of flights in the United States were delayed, the worst rate for that seven-month period since 2008, according to the Transportation Department’s  Bad weather clobbered the system last winter — but the delay rate actually increased to almost 25 percent in July. Equipment and scheduling problems by airlines and at airports were the main causes of those delays, followed by aviation-system problems like congestion. Weather came in third, according to the federal data. There is, incidentally, a contentious issue developing between airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration partly centered on the agency’s delay-plagued development of its so-called NextGen air traffic control redesigns. Some in the industry have argued that, especially with advances over the years in in-flight technology, airlines could reduce delays and improve air traffic efficiencies by tracking their own flights, rather than depending so much on ground-based third-party control. “Airlines have had the ability to track their own airspace for 20 years,” said Michael Baiada, the chief executive of ATH Group, a company developing systems for better aircraft flow efficiencies within a program called Free Flight. For now, I’m happy to see the better technology in cockpits to address even routine issues like in-flight turbulence. As Mr. Lusk, the Southwest pilot, put it: Unanticipated or difficult-to-avoid rough weather is something pilots worry about, “because the next thing you know, you can have passengers bouncing off the ceiling.”
