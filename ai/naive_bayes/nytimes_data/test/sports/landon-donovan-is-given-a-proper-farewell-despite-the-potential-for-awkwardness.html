Landon Donovan Is Given a Proper Farewell, Despite the Potential for Awkwardness
After being left off the World Cup roster this summer, Donovan put aside the awkwardness with U.S. men’s national team and played the final game of his 15-year international career, a friendly match against Ecuador.

EAST HARTFORD, Conn. —  Fans around the gray bleachers at Rentschler Field bellowed when Landon Donovan’s name was announced over the public address system Friday. Flags featuring his likeness festooned the stands behind one of the goals, while a large banner with the word Legend, and Donovan’s number, 10, fluttered nearby. And before he and the United States men’s national team played an exhibition game here against Ecuador, he was presented a framed jersey to commemorate his 15-year international career. Donovan, as recently as two months ago, did not want any of this. On the day in early August that Donovan, 32, announced that he would retire, Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, went to him with a sensitive question: Would he be open to playing one last game in a national team uniform? Donovan’s said no; Gulati asked him to think about it. It was certainly a touchy subject. Earlier in the summer, Jurgen Klinsmann, the coach of the United States team, left Donovan off his World Cup roster — a decision that stunned everyone, especially Donovan. In the ensuing weeks, Donovan made his bitterness plain, and his relationship to Klinsmann, which had always felt uneasy, essentially came to an end. But Gulati felt strongly that Donovan, who has recorded more international goals and assists than any other American man, deserved a proper tribute — even if it would have to take place amid profound awkwardness — and in a series of conversations, he changed Donovan’s mind. “It’s very few times you get to say goodbye in the right way,” Gulati said Friday afternoon, “and this isn’t the perfect way, given the last 12 months. I get that. But it’s a pretty good way.” The weirdness of the occasion was openly discussed. Donovan referred to the event as “interesting” and said it would have been unimaginable earlier in the year. He said he did not think he could be comfortable again around the team. But, Donovan said, “I looked at the big picture and realize what a special day this would be.” Donovan was not with the team during the week, and in the days leading up to the game, reports and speculation on whether he and Klinsmann had actually spoken to each other were widespread. In his news conference, Donovan reiterated multiple times that he felt he should have gone to the World Cup. But he emphasized, too, that he was at peace with how the situation had unfolded. He said he had learned more about himself through it. Still, Donovan did not try to sugarcoat his status with Klinsmann. At one point during the news conference, Donovan was asked to describe their relationship. Donovan paused a moment, shrugged, and then let out a quiet laugh. “I mean, you know, Jeff,” he said. “You know.” Donovan started the game and came close on a few scoring chances. He was substituted after 40 minutes, allowing him to be fresh to play Sunday with his club, the Los Angeles Galaxy. The noise level increased in the stadium as the change was made. Before heading toward the sideline, Donovan shook hands with every teammate on the field and then spun around on his heels, acknowledging the fans. Klinsmann clapped as he watched Donovan skip toward the bench, and when he got there, the two men shook hands. Klinsmann held on to Donovan’s shoulder a moment and said something into his ear. They separated with smiles on their faces. For all the awkwardness between the player and coach, the close friendship of Donovan and Gulati was obvious and essential to making the event happen. Donovan thanked Gulati for orchestrating the night and accommodating 20 members of his family members. Gulati, a senior lecturer in the economics department at Columbia, said he was eager to see what Donovan did next. “The analogy I would draw here is that Landon’s taken 15 gap years — if I use a university analogy — from high school straight into a job,” Gulati said of Donovan, who was a teenager when he began his career. “Now he’s going to college and figure out what he’s going to do, and he doesn’t have to decide on any majors for a couple of years.” It could have been awkward for Gulati, too, as he was the driving force in getting Klinsmann hired in June 2011. But he showed tact in staying away from conflict. Near the end of the news conference, a reporter asked Gulati if he might be willing to reveal how he reacted upon hearing the news four months ago that Donovan was not picked to go to Brazil. “My reaction hasn’t changed,” Gulati said. “My comment hasn’t changed.” The reporter noted that Gulati had never actually commented on the decision. “Right,” Gulati said, pausing as laughter bubbled inside the room. “Good memory.”
