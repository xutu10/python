Without Cruz, Giants Hope to Unearth Another Diamond at Receiver
If the Giants are going to rebound from the loss to the Eagles and a season-ending injury to Victor Cruz they will have to rely on a largely unproven group of receivers.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —  Victor Cruz is out for the season, leaving five Giants wide receivers with wholly disparate backgrounds to fill the void. One,  A second receiver, the rookie  Another,  The next receiver,  The last in the group may be under the most pressure. He is Odell Beckham Jr., a rookie first-round draft pick who missed so much time with a hamstring injury that he is being spoon-fed the intricacies of the team’s new offensive system. But if the Giants are going to breathe new life into a season jarred by twin blows — a humiliating defeat in Philadelphia and the  “Yeah, some new guys are going to have to step up and step up right now,” Manning said. “But it’s happened before. It happened with Victor.” Cruz was an undrafted, largely unknown receiver until he assumed a bigger role in 2011 because of injuries to starters. Manning has not forgotten. “Somebody got hurt; he stepped up into a role and made a lot of big plays for us,” Manning said Wednesday. “Someone’s going to have an opportunity to do that. Let’s see who that guy can be.” The five receivers who will take the field Sunday against the Cowboys in Arlington, Tex., were assembled in hodgepodge fashion. Parker, a high school all-American in Florida, attended Florida State but was dismissed from the team after multiple arrests. He then transferred to North Alabama. When he became a Giant this year, Parker recalled the tough neighborhood he knew growing up and insisted that some of the best players in the nation were out of the game and living in South Florida. “The best talent is on the streets, guys who never even touched college, let alone the N.F.L.,” Parker said. “Guys I knew back then were unbelievably good, and I learned a lot from them. But those guys get distracted and don’t even go to school. It doesn’t mean they aren’t great athletes. I think of that all the time.” Parker was back in his old neighborhood after the New Orleans Saints cut him in training camp in the summer of 2013. Before that, he had been released by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sept. 20, 2012. Until last month, when he suited up for the Giants, that was the last time he had played in the N.F.L. During that long layoff, he went home to find a job. “When I say I was begging for money, I’m sort of joking and sort of serious,” Parker said. He finally got work building  “That’s heavy, hard labor,” Parker said. “Digging holes, dragging logs. It taught me to not to pass up any opportunities. And this one with the Giants is a big one.” Washington had some fits and starts to his path to the Giants as well. Reared in North Charleston, S.C., he sat out his junior season in high school because he was academically ineligible. But he still practiced every day. “On game days, I was the water boy,” Washington said. When he graduated from high school, his grades were not high enough for him to be considered a Division I prospect, so he went to the Georgia Military College and then to tiny Newberry College, which played in Division II. It was not easy to be noticed at Newberry, in South Carolina, but Washington, because he was 6 feet 4 inches, was always something of an asset, and he ended up in the springtime camp of the Arizona Cardinals this year. Arizona released him May 28. But by then, Washington was on the radar of Giants scouts. The Giants claimed Washington the day after the Cardinals cut him. When Washington, who was reared by his grandparents Betty and Earl Polite, left for the Giants’ summer training camp this year, Betty gave him a succinct send-off: “Just work hard. Don’t come home.” Washington has not seen his grandmother since July. He caught four preseason touchdown passes for the Giants, three that were game-winning receptions. That earned him a spot on the roster, but it has not gotten him much playing time yet. But Manning will most likely be looking Washington’s way when the Giants approach the goal line, especially in the absence of Cruz, who worked well in the close quarters of the end zone. Ogletree is the most experienced of the Giants’ receivers, having broken into the league in 2009. He played four years for Dallas, four games for Tampa Bay and parts of two seasons with the Detroit Lions. A Queens native, he became friendly with Cruz while trying to stay in shape during the 2011 N.F.L. lockout. Last week, he was dressing next to Cruz’s vacant locker. He was given pads, shoes and a helmet, but his locker had no nameplate. He did not appear offended. “I’m here to do whatever they want me to,” Ogletree said. “I’ve been around a little. I can learn fast.” After two practices, the Giants’ offensive coordinator, Ben McAdoo, said Ogletree already understood much of the terminology — not an easy task in 48 hours. In some ways, Ogletree is in enemy territory — he grew up a Jets fan. “But when you’re from here in New York,” he said, smiling, “you got to love everybody.” Last season, Randle was the most prominent receiver caught in a dysfunctional offense. Manning was intercepted eight times when throwing in Randle’s direction. After the season, Randle estimated that 80 percent of those interceptions resulted from a miscommunication between him and Manning. They now insist they are on the same page, and Randle is leading the team in receptions (28) and receiving yards (247) among active players. “I do think he is doing things better and we are on the same page on a lot of things,” Manning said of Randle. “The big thing is that each week there is always something — a new route or new concept — and we have to be sure we stay on the same page.” The receiver whose skills are most similar to Cruz’s is Beckham, who has limitless potential but limited experience. A major goal is to find ways to hastily increase Beckham’s role in the passing game. “We want to get Odell as involved as possible,” Coach Tom Coughlin said. “Of course we do.” Cruz recognized that Beckham’s role would become pivotal. “From the time I got here,” Beckham said, “he took me under his wing and started teaching me everything. He called me little bro.” When Cruz was injured in Philadelphia, Beckham went to his teammate’s side and spoke briefly. “I told him, ‘I got you, big bro; I got this now,’ ” Beckham said.
