After waiting 53 years to take part in his first Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race, Ken Read has had to scramble to get ready. The veteran American yachtsman — one of the most experienced at the elite end of the sport — is the skipper of the new 100-foot supermaxi Comanche, which was launched in late September. Backed by a billionaire owner, Jim Clark, Comanche was designed and built not only to win ocean races but to break records. Read and his high-profile crew, which includes the America’s Cup winner Jimmy Spithill, have had to race the clock to prepare the cutting-edge yacht for its first big test. Read, 53, a former America’s Cup helmsman and Volvo Ocean race skipper who is also president of North Sails, spoke with Christopher Clarey of The International New York Times from Sydney last week.
