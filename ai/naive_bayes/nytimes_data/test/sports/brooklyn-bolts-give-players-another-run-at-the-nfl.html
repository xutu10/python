Latest Fledgling League Gives Players Another Run at the N.F.L. 
The Brooklyn Bolts are one of four teams in the Fall Experimental Football League, which hopes to avoid mistakes of past minor league football leagues by keeping costs down while avoiding serious injuries.

On Wednesday night in Coney Island, about 80 football players worked on their résumés in heavy rain in front of a small crowd on a field painted over a Class A baseball diamond. The players for the Brooklyn Bolts and the Boston Brawlers, nearly all of whom had preseason or practice-squad experience in the N.F.L., braved the deluge in the brand-new  “There’s things we’re having to endure that we haven’t experienced in a long time,” Brawlers quarterback Tajh Boyd, the 2012 Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year while at Clemson, said before boarding a bus for the trip back to Boston. He chose to give the F.X.F.L. a try after the Jets cut him in August. The football landscape is littered with the remains of professional leagues come and gone: the United Football League, the United States Football League and the X.F.L. F.X.F.L. organizers acknowledged the challenge, but said the N.F.L. needed a minor league to help players with professional talent and nowhere to play. “We’re keeping these guys battle-ready,” said Brian Woods, the F.X.F.L.’s founder and commissioner. “This is better than the Canadian football product. I can assure you it’s way better than the arena football product.” Woods and the F.X.F.L. have tried to avoid the mistakes made by past ventures by keeping costs down. The 160 players on the league’s four teams make a maximum of $1,000 per game during the six-week season. That is not a lot of money to put one’s body through the physical rigors of football, but the league has several rules designed to avoid concussions and other serious injuries. Cut blocking is not allowed at the line of scrimmage or point of attack, and kickoff rules attempt to minimize high-impact collisions. The F.X.F.L. uses the same concussion protocol as the N.F.L. and provides the players with medical insurance. The players also will be eligible for workers’ compensation. Many players in Wednesday’s game were not worried about injuries, saying it was more important to get playing time. “That was part of the problem with the N.F.L.: I wasn’t getting the reps,” Boyd said. As the Brawlers took the field, Darrin Mims pointed out his 6-foot-8 brother, Boston lineman David Mims, who was signed by the Baltimore Ravens and the Kansas City Chiefs but was cut without playing. Darrin and his parents had driven to Brooklyn from Charlotte, N.C., to see the game. “He hasn’t played a complete game since college,” Darrin Mims said of David. “This right here is guys going for a last-ditch effort. It was between this and going to Canada for him.” Other pro football leagues have been unable to become formal developmental systems for the N.F.L., which already has what most consider a robust minor league in the N.C.A.A. The N.F.L. has resisted overtures from second-tier leagues in the past, and there is no indication the F.X.F.L. is in a better position. An N.F.L. spokesman declined to comment on the F.X.F.L. or developmental leagues in general. Unlike in the Canadian Football League, where players must sign two-year contracts, F.X.F.L. players have the flexibility to go back and forth between the N.F.L. and the new league. Brooklyn offensive lineman Jordan McCray signed with the Green Bay Packers before the Bolts had even played a game. The new league offers out-of-work players — who must be no more than three years removed from college ball — the chance to get game film, essential for those hoping to get signed, said Johnny Millard, a Brooklyn linebacker who was cut by the St. Louis Rams after the preseason. “It didn’t feel right to just walk away,” Millard said. “And to get back to the N.F.L., you have to have film to stay relevant.” Regardless of the league’s low-cost model, making money is a requirement, said Michael Huyghue, who was the commissioner of the failed United Football League, which folded in 2012 during its fourth season. The F.X.F.L. needs a lucrative television contract to survive, he said. “What the U.F.L. did not succeed in doing was finding a sustainable business model,” Huyghue said. “I think this new league is smart because it’s trying to push down costs, but at the end of the day, they’re not going to be able to make revenues.” F.X.F.L. games are played on weeknights to avoid conflicts with college football and the N.F.L. The new league has also eschewed big stadiums in favor of cozier venues like Coney Island’s MCU Park, home of the Brooklyn Cyclones, which has the F.X.F.L.’s smallest capacity at 10,000. The Cyclones are a Class A affiliate of the Mets. Jeff Wilpon, the Mets’ chief operating officer, is a co-owner of the Bolts. “I’m not 100 percent sure it has staying power, but I think it’s in a good position to have staying power,” Wilpon said. For some fans, at least, the games provide affordable entertainment nearby. Most tickets to Bolts games cost $20 to $35. And for many at Brooklyn’s 27-20 victory, which drew a paid attendance of about 1,400, the primary attraction appeared to be that the Bolts were not the Jets or the Giants. “You’re still better than Geno Smith!” one fan yelled after Brooklyn quarterback Corey Robinson threw an errant pass. “Even if you gave me a Jets ticket, I wouldn’t even consider it because of the hassle,” said Larry Troy, a resident of Babylon on Long Island, who described himself as a long-suffering Jets fan. “I have a family and a mortgage,” he added. “I can’t afford to spend $200 or $300 to take my family. If you make it affordable, people will come out, no doubt.”
