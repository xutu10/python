Tiny Boxing Champion Hekkie Budler Rules in Lightest Division
Hekkie Budler is preparing to defend the two belts he holds in the minimumweight division, the lightest sanctioned classification in boxing.
===
MONACO —  Hekkie Budler cradled his world championship belts lovingly then turned and, without hesitation, made a confession. “This one,” he said, pointing to a green-toned leather belt, “doesn’t actually stay up. I have to put it on my shoulder.” Budler shrugged. So it goes for the littlest boxing champion in the world, a battler who has a title belt that falls off his hips like old sweatpants and shoes he bought in the children’s section and a baby face that people often mistake for a teenager’s. But Budler, a sprightly South African, does not mind being small. To the contrary, it means people often underestimate him, whether it was an oversize rugby player in high school who tried to bully him (and got popped) or a boxing fan who thinks the tinier fighters don’t pack any punch. “There have actually been times I wished I was smaller,” he said. That would be scientifically difficult: Budler, 26, is 5 feet 3 inches and about 100 pounds. His lean, spindly physique might seem a better fit in an eighth-grade dodgeball game than here, on the French Riviera, where on Saturday Budler will walk to a raised ring in front of a well-heeled crowd and perhaps throw upward of 1,000 punches at his opponent, Xiong Zhao Zhong, a Chinese fighter known as the Mini Mike Tyson. Yet here Budler is, preparing to defend the two belts he holds in the minimumweight division, the lightest sanctioned classification in boxing, and one that limits fighters to weights of no more than 105 pounds. (The belt from the International Boxing Organization is the one that sags off Budler’s 28-inch waist; he also holds a better-fitting one from the World Boxing Council.) Lower-weight boxing is an acquired taste. If the stereotypical match is between two big-boned palookas throwing haymakers like a couple of trucks slamming into each other, a minimumweight fight is, Budler says, “like two speeding bullets coming together.” He then revised his description: “Maybe it’s more like two woodpeckers banging on a piece of wood, over and over and over again.” The little guys, as Budler’s trainer, Colin Nathan, calls them, have not often captivated the sports world the way bigger boxers have, though loyalists believe there may be a bit of an opening. For years, heavyweights were the stars, but a drop-off in competition during the era when the Klitschko brothers — Vitali and Wladimir — were boringly dominant opened up the landscape to smaller fighters. Now, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao, two fighters who have moved up and down in the central weight classes, are the sport’s biggest names. Budler is far from their level and size. But that does not mean he is not powerful. Among the reasons that Budler, who is nicknamed the Hexecutioner, has shot to relative fame in South Africa is because he has won a lot — he is 26-1 with nine knockouts — and because he has the ability to deliver devastating punches, which is not necessarily the norm in his division. “A lot of these guys are volume punchers,” Nathan said. He then referred to Budler’s favored left hook. “Hekkie’s punches do damage,” he said. This much quickly becomes clear during Budler’s training sessions. One day this week, he and Ryno Liebenberg, a light heavyweight trained by Nathan who will also fight on Saturday’s card, went through an afternoon workout together. The conditions were not ideal. There had been a miscommunication with the local boxing gym, so Budler and Liebenberg skipped rope in the dank stairwell of their hotel and then moved into a hastily arranged conference room where one of them bounced and did aerobic work in a corner while across the room the other threw punches at Nathan, who was wearing mitts and a protective suit around his torso. Liebenberg is big and sturdy, so his shots made predictably loud thwaps when they landed. When it was Budler’s turn, he stepped in, clad in a tracksuit with a plastic sauna suit beneath to help him sweat, and began languidly, dancing around and talking strategy with Nathan before firing off punches that, suddenly, landed with the echo of a jackhammer. Bernie Pailman, who works in Budler’s corner, smiled at the staccato soundtrack. “He may be little, but he hits big,” Pailman said. Budler did not take a sip of water during the hour-plus workout — he also eats only twice a day, to help maintain his weight — but smiled for much of it, clearly enjoying himself despite the Spartan surroundings. While big-name fighters may earn millions for a bout, the most Budler has made for a fight is about $50,000, Nathan said. A lavish lifestyle is not what Budler is about. Budler, Nathan and the rest of Budler’s team arrived here from South Africa on Sunday, stopping for a long layover in Dubai. They flew economy class — “Hekkie doesn’t have problems with leg room,” one member of his team joked — and chuckled when a passer-by, upon realizing he had bumped into a boxing entourage, assumed that Caz Abrahams, Budler’s tall and well-built strength and conditioning coach, was the champion in the group. “That happens a lot,” Abrahams said. Obviously Budler hopes to fight for bigger paydays as his career progresses, particularly because he is set to be married next weekend. (His fiancée has no problem if he has a black eye in their wedding photographs, he said.) But he said that money had never been his motivator, and that he had plans to go into real estate management whenever his fighting days end. For now, though, he is enjoying himself. He gravitated to boxing when he was 8, sent to the gym by his mother after he played (and lost) a rugby match and promptly blamed everyone on the team but himself. Boxing, his family reasoned, was a sport where he would learn to take responsibility. It stuck. A few years later, in his first youth bout in a ring, Budler knocked down his opponent five times in three rounds; he told his parents afterward that he “got tired of the guy getting up.” His desire to put people on the mat has not waned. It does not matter that he has two iguanas, Lou and Lula, who are longer than he is tall (they live in his backyard). It does not matter that his boxing boots are size 6. It does not matter that the two teenagers who stopped him for a picture in the hotel lobby this week both towered over him. “All I ever wanted was to be a professional boxer,” Budler said. “Now I want to be the best in the world, whatever my size.”
