Taking Issue With the Grind of the N.B.A. Season 
Michele Roberts, the leader of the league’s players union, addressed quality-of-life issues that affect players with strong opinions that prompted a response from Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner.

No sooner had Oklahoma City defeated Boston on Wednesday night then the Celtics’ disappointment was washed away by the anticipation of Friday night’s game at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Big 3 of LeBron James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. Oops. This just in. The Cavaliers’ first-year coach, David Blatt, announced that the Big 3 would not play. The team has to fly back to Cleveland for a game Saturday evening against Atlanta. The players need their rest. I’m making this up, of course. James, Love and Irving are scheduled to take on the Celtics. But this is the kind of tactic the  Last week, Popovich raised eyebrows — yet again — when he announced that five Spurs would not play in Houston in a nationally televised game against the Rockets. Appropriately, the length of the N.B.A. season and the controversy over resting players in games on consecutive nights have now become quality-of-life issues that the N.B.A. will be forced to confront by the players union’s new, and very determined, executive director, Michele Roberts. Roberts was picked As in: The players are the game, not the owners. “Why don’t we have the owners play half the games?” she said in the article. “There would be no money if not for the players. Let’s call it what it is.” And as in: The salary cap is incredibly un-American; my DNA is offended by it; no one says it out loud, but it’s a monopoly. “I don’t know of any space other than the world of sports where there’s this notion that we will artificially deflate what someone’s able to make, just because,” she said. Roberts’s comments were strong enough to compel the N.B.A. commissioner, Adam Silver, to respond with a statement on Thursday in which he said the league “couldn’t disagree more with these statements.” Silver is now making headlines of his own with  “The N.B.A.'s success is based on the collective efforts and investments of all of the team owners, the thousands of employees at our teams and arenas, and our extraordinarily talented players,” Silver said. “No single group could accomplish this on its own. Nor is there anything unusual or ‘un-American’ in a unionized industry to have a collective system for paying employees — in fact, that’s the norm.” As for the salary cap, Silver said it had served as a “foundation for the growth of the league” and had allowed N.B.A. players to become “the highest-paid professional athletes in the world.” Silver went on to say that all of these issues would be discussed with the union at an “appropriate time.” And indeed they will be, with Roberts leading the way. In her remarks to ESPN, she hit at the toll the long season takes on players, the grind it becomes. “Every time a player gets hurt, I think, ‘My God, they really are pushing their bodies,’ ” she said. “And back-to-backs, those are the ones I really find disturbing.” She added, “I don’t think it would hurt the game to shorten the season.” Unthinkable? Who would have thought an N.B.A. commissioner would endorse legalized betting? When Popovich famously sent his stars back to San Antonio to rest in 2012 rather than play in a nationally televised game against the Heat in Miami, he noted that the N.B.A. had not really detailed any guidelines on resting players. “I don’t really know what the rules are,” he said. He is not alone. The N.B.A. does require teams to notify the league in advance if they are considering resting a player. As soon as a team makes the decision, it has to make an announcement. Earlier this week, the Spurs considered sitting Duncan and Ginobli. They were listed on the injury report as questionable, with “rest” listed as the injury. Both Spurs wound up playing. But there is really no hard rule as to how many players can properly be rested for a single game, or a group of games. Meanwhile, Popovich’s defiant rest initiative is as strategic as it is compassionate. Perhaps even more strategic than compassionate. Resting players has compelled the Spurs to develop a deep bench while keeping veteran players fresh. Brad Stevens, the Celtics’ coach, said he noticed the difference last season, when the Spurs played the Celtics without Tony Parker, Ginobili and Kawhi Leonard and used backups instead. “They came in and played great, and those guys continued to play all through the playoffs,” Stevens said. “Not only were they well-rested when the playoffs came, but guys on the bench were ready.” Brooks, the Thunder’s coach and a former player, has already concluded that less is more. “When I played there were no days off,” he said. “It was a code of honor: You played every game and you practiced every day.” He remembers two-a-day practices before the season began. “I’m glad we are not doing that,” he said. “I can’t imagine putting our players through that. That was too much. I think it’s a good balance right now.” Nonetheless, Popovich is exploiting an ambiguity on the rest issue that the N.B.A., in conjunction with an assertive Roberts, should clarify. Cleveland is scheduled to play a high-profile game against San Antonio on March 12. Perhaps, on the day of the game, disappointed Spurs fans will learn that Cleveland’s Big 3 will not play. The reason? They need their rest.
