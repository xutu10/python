WACO, Tex. —  Baylor’s high-flying, fast-paced, spread-wide, score-happy style has come to epitomize the Big 12 Conference since Robert Griffin III threw four touchdown passes in the fourth quarter and overtime to beat Kansas in 2011. No. 5 Baylor did not need overtime on Saturday, although it spent large parts of the game seemingly trying to hand a strong Texas Christian squad a road victory through missed opportunities and big errors, including a 94-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the second quarter and an interception for another score in the fourth. Yet the Bears, facing a 21-point fourth-quarter deficit, scored 24 unanswered points in the last 11 minutes, including a field goal as the clock expired, to win, 61-58. “We just know that we’re never out of it,” Baylor quarterback Bryce Petty said. “We never really are.” The victory put Baylor at the top of the pecking order in the Big 12, the only major conference that does not have a championship game. Baylor (6-0, 3-0) will almost certainly receive a top-four ranking Sunday in the next Associated Press poll and be in excellent shape to mount a run to qualify for the inaugural College Football Playoff, whose four contestants will be selected by a committee. Its next big tests come in November, when it travels to No. 11 Oklahoma and hosts No. 16 Oklahoma State. It hosts No. 17 Kansas State on the last day of the season. T.C.U. (4-1, 1-1), ranked ninth, fell just short on Saturday as the season approached its midway point. The Horned Frogs host Oklahoma State next Saturday. Despite the victory, the game may have been something of a defeat for the Heisman Trophy hopes of Baylor quarterback Bryce Petty. A senior, Petty had gaudy passing numbers (28 for 55, 510 yards, six touchdowns) but also costly turnovers, including the interception that Marcus Mallet returned 51 yards to give the Horned Frogs a 58-37 lead with 11 minutes 38 seconds left in the game. Petty was sacked four times, too, and these were partly because he held the ball too long. Several times, he overthrew open receivers. The reputation of Baylor’s defense may have also taken a hit. It entered the game ranked fourth in the Football Bowl Subdivision, allowing an average of 267.2 yards. No opponent had scored more than 28 points. The Horned Frogs managed 31 in the first half alone and had 485 total yards. But Baylor’s offense, despite three turnovers, was up to the task, particularly late in the game, racking up 782 yards along the way. “It puts a tremendous amount of energy and confidence into us,” Coach Art Briles said after the game. “These are wins you think about, dream about, fight for.” Although Briles would not speculate on how the win would affect the national conversation, Petty did, revealing a chip on the team’s shoulder that perhaps comes with being a program that is not considered a traditional football power. “I think this is just a statement game for us,” Petty said. “I’m sure we’ll have something on Monday — ‘T.C.U. wasn’t playing well’ or something — but it’s another chance to prove that we’re here to stay. It really doesn’t matter who you put on the other side of the field.” T.C.U. typically has a stout defense under Coach Gary Patterson. But in the off-season, Patterson retooled his offense, the result of which has been at least 48 points scored in three of its five games. A particular revelation Saturday was running back B. J. Catalon, a junior, who scored two touchdowns on the ground and a third on the 94-yard kickoff return. He also caught two passes for 71 yards. Although this was the 102nd meeting between the programs, it was the first in which both teams were nationally ranked. Early rain cleared up in time for the midafternoon kickoff at Baylor’s new McLane Stadium, with a capacity of 45,000-plus and an end zone that overlooks a man-made cove on the Brazos River. “I thought our crowd was phenomenal,” Briles said. “I don’t know if we win this game on the road. But we weren’t on the road. We were at home.” The game was clearly the conference’s main event, even though Saturday also saw the 99th iteration of the Red River Rivalry, at the old Cotton Bowl in Dallas, 100 miles north up Interstate 35. There, Oklahoma and Texas — which between them have won 73 conference championships and 11 national titles, and at various points in recent years threatened to depart the Big 12 altogether — battled to an uninspired 31-26 Sooners victory. While there are no moral victories in football, even T.C.U. could derive some satisfaction from its newfound place on the national stage. Baylor, though, will look ahead to bigger potential victories.
