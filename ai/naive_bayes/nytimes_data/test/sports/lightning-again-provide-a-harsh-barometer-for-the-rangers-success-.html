Lightning Again Provide a Harsh Barometer for the Rangers’ Success

Another reunion game at Madison Square Garden on Monday represented a chance for the  The Rangers entered the game as winners of four of their last six games, with the two defeats coming from their opponent, the  Tampa Bay forwards Brett Connolly and Tyler Johnson each scored their second goals of the game in the third period as the Lightning skated away with a 6-3 win and a sweep of the three-game season series. “We had a couple of key performers tonight that picked a bad night to have an ordinary game,” Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault said, without being specific. “Unfortunately, when you are playing against such a strong opponent, you need your ‘A’ game from throughout your lineup.” Connolly broke a 3-3 tie with a power-play goal at 5 minutes 34 seconds of the final period, his fourth goal of the season. Johnson made the score 5-3 at 6:58 with his eighth. Ondrej Palat added an empty-net goal to complete the scoring. Lightning goaltender Ben Bishop made 32 saves, improving to 8-0-0 against the inconsistent Rangers (11-9-4). The 6-foot-7 Bishop is 15-3-2 this season, and he continued to dominate against his counterpart Henrik Lundqvist. “I don’t know why I have so much success against the Rangers,” Bishop said. “Maybe I just pick up my game against Lundqvist because he’s such a good goaltender.” It was the fourth straight victory for Tampa Bay (17-6-2), which is the league’s highest scoring team and is off to the best start in franchise history. “It doesn’t matter beating any team three times,” Lightning Coach Jon Cooper said. “Just winning in this league is hard.” The Rangers showed only flashes of stout opposition against the Lightning. They played a strong middle period, which began with the Lightning leading by 2-1. The Rangers came out with a jump in the second, and the rookie Jesper Fast scored his second goal in two games with an easy tap-in at 2:42. Martin St. Louis — the former captain of the Lightning who was honored before the game for the 1,000th career point he achieved with a goal at Philadelphia on Friday — put the Rangers ahead by 3-2 on the power play. St. Louis’s 10th goal of the season came at 9:24 and brought cascading cheers in the Garden. St. Louis, 39, came to the Rangers in a trade for Callahan on March 5. He played 972 games with 953 points for the Lightning over 13 seasons. The game’s pivotal sequence occurred late in the second after the Lightning had a five-on-three power play for 1:20. The Rangers smothered every Tampa Bay chance, but 26 seconds after Ryan McDonagh returned to the ice to restore even strength, Lightning defenseman Matt Carle tied the game at 3 after his defense partner Anton Stralman — another former Ranger — kept the puck in the offensive zone. The goal proved deflating for the Rangers’ hopes even though they started the third period tied. “It was a big goal for them, no doubt,” St. Louis said. “They have a lot of weapons. We played them three times in two weeks; if you don’t get on the good side at least once, it’s tough to take.” Johnson opened the scoring at 6:32 of the first with a slap shot past Lundqvist, who did not have his best night, with only 15 saves. Lundqvist is 9-7-3. Kevin Hayes answered for the Rangers with his third goal of the year at 12:14 after his linemate Carl Hagelin passed him the puck in front of Bishop. Connolly, 22, the sixth overall pick in the 2010 draft by Tampa Bay, caught the Rangers on a line change, and outmaneuvered defenseman Marc Staal before beating Lundqvist with a slap shot at 16:02. As is their style, the Lightning kept coming at the Rangers in speedy waves. And Bishop, who made an acrobatic sliding save on Rick Nash late in the third, was stellar when he had to be. “Bish was great for us again,” said Johnson, 24, who joined the Lightning as an undrafted free agent. “He’s done it so many times this season already.”
