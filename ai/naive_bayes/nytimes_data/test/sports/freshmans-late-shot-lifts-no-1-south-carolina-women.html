The freshman A’ja Wilson scored with 1.8 seconds left, lifting No. 1 South Carolina to a win at No. 9  Asia Dozier scored 11 points, and Wilson added 10 for the Gamecocks (8-0), who trailed by 4 with less than 20 seconds left but rallied for their first road win against a top-10 team in nearly three years. Duke’s Rebecca Greenwell had 12 points, and the all-American Elizabeth Williams had all 5 of hers in the final four and a half minutes. Duke (5-3), which had 22 turnovers, is on its first three-game losing streak since 2007-8. Greenwell made two free throws with 41.9 seconds left put Duke ahead by 50-46, and the Blue Devils appeared to be on the verge of their first victory over a No. 1-ranked team since 2007. Then came South Carolina’s comeback. Tiffany Mitchell hit a 3-pointer with 17.9 seconds left, and Khadijah Sessions and Olivia Gaines teamed to steal the ball from Greenwell in the backcourt. After calling timeout with 10.9 seconds left, the Gamecocks worked the ball to Mitchell, who missed in the lane. The rebound went to Wilson, who scored in traffic. Ka’lia Johnson’s desperation heave at the buzzer didn’t come close for Duke — sealing career win No. 301 for South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley.
