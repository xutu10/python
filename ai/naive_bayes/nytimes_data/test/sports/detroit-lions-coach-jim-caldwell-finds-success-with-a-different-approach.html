Detroit Lions Coach Jim Caldwell Finds Success With a Different Approach
With a firm but fair touch, Jim Caldwell has transformed the Lions (10-4), who are tied with the Green Bay Packers atop the N.F.C. North.
===
ALLEN PARK, Mich. —  Jim Caldwell stood before his  In Finnish. During the past 11 months, the Lions have come to learn what the Baltimore Ravens appreciated about Caldwell, and what the Indianapolis Colts and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers did before that — how in word and in deed, he defies the stereotype of an N.F.L. coach. He recites poetry and proverbs,  “He’s always got something new for me,” defensive end Darryl Tapp said. “You can’t be stale in this league.” With a firm but fair touch, Caldwell has transformed the Lions (10-4), who are tied with the Green Bay Packers atop the N.F.C. North. Beyond restoring discipline to a team infamous for committing dumb penalties, he reversed Detroit’s ball-security woes, coaxing a 21-turnover swing — to plus eight from minus 13 through the same stage of last season, according to Pro Football Reference. A group that shriveled in close games, going 2-6 in contests decided by 4 points or fewer, now almost never loses: The Lions are 4-1 in those circumstances. “There’s a different mentality to this football team, of what it takes to be successful,” Detroit General Manager Martin Mayhew said. “Jim’s had a dramatic impact on the psyche of this football team.” Yet one element of their sordid past remains unresolved for the Lions: their penchant for late-season collapses. To avoid one under his watch, Caldwell moved the team meeting to Finland, figuratively, on Wednesday. A voracious reader, Caldwell plucked out the word sisu — loosely translated as the ability to carry out the burden of responsibility under pressure and extenuating circumstances — while learning about the Finnish skier Eero Mantyranta in “The Sports Gene” by David Epstein. Sisu, Caldwell told his players, should define who they are and what they want to achieve. With a victory Sunday in Chicago, the Lions, losers of their past 16 games when the temperature is below 40 degrees, would clinch only their second playoff berth since 2000. Caldwell’s delivery (and language) may change from day to day, from week to week, but not much else does. He arrived in Detroit with instant credibility, having won Super Bowls as an assistant in Indianapolis and Baltimore and reached another in his first season coaching the Colts. He has tutored quarterbacks like Kerry Collins, Brad Johnson, Peyton Manning and Joe Flacco. In his first speech, Caldwell, who through a team spokesman declined an interview request, told the Lions that he expected to win this season and that they should, too. He dismissed their popular portrayal as bad boys, instead praising their character. He told them that by playing in a respectful way, they would get the respect they craved. To get to know his players, Caldwell, who turns 60 next month, took them to dinner, by position group, at a restaurant of their choosing. He asked about their backgrounds, their families, their favorite books and films. He shared stories about his career, his influences, his children and grandchildren. “In 12 years, that’s the first time I’ve been to dinner with my head coach,” cornerback Rashean Mathis said. “Ask any guy in this locker room, would they mind living in his house growing up? They would say no. They would accept him as a father.” In personality and in pedigree, Caldwell appealed to the Lions. After firing the feisty Jim Schwartz, they wanted an experienced coach — “we’re not a teardown,” Mayhew said — to maximize their investment in quarterback Matthew Stafford. During the search process, Mayhew heard from the former Indianapolis and Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy, who lauded Caldwell’s professionalism and rapport with quarterbacks; the former Colts general manager Bill Polian, who praised his steadiness; and Manning, who extolled his mastery of fundamentals. Had Mayhew reached out to everyone eager to endorse Caldwell, he would still be on the phone. Rey Dempsey, the former head coach at Southern Illinois, would have relayed how Caldwell, at 22, aced his interview there, a six-hour test of his football knowledge. Or how, after the restaurant that served the pregame meal forgot that the team was playing at home, Caldwell spent much of the morning in the kitchen, defrosting steaks. “He knew you don’t make excuses,” said Dempsey, who hired Caldwell out of Iowa, his alma mater, where he spent a season as a graduate assistant. “He’d say, ‘We had to work hard where I came from.’ ” Jamie Barresi would have described the coaches meetings 25 years ago at Penn State, where Joe Paterno would veer from one thought to another to another, leaving his assistants scrambling to keep up. Not Caldwell, who, on his yellow pad in perfect penmanship, would jot down Paterno’s every point. “It was like you could relive the meeting by reading his notes,” said Barresi, who worked with Caldwell at Penn State before following him to Wake Forest in 1992. “Jim had a way of sorting it all out for us and making it simple.” Jeff Saturday would have explained how, at the beginning of every Colts practice, Caldwell went over the offensive game plan, imitating a strong safety or a weakside linebacker to give Manning different looks. “You always respected his thoughts and ideas,” said Saturday, the Colts’ longtime center, who now works as an analyst for ESPN, “because you knew he had seen it from both sides.” Recognized for his offensive expertise, Caldwell played defensive back at Iowa, and the first three position-specific coaching jobs he held — at Southern Illinois, Northwestern and Colorado — were on defense. His father, Willie, worked 35 years in the automotive industry, learning every job at the plant, and Caldwell approached his career with same curiosity. At Louisville, where Caldwell coached the wide receivers for a season, Howard Schnellenberger would say that he did not need computers because he had assistants. Caldwell has detailed every meeting and every speech given by every head coach he has worked for — from Dempsey to Dennis Green, Schnellenberger to Bill McCartney, Paterno to Dungy — since arriving at Southern Illinois in 1978. Before interviewing for the Lions’ job, Caldwell prepared by watching tape of every pass Stafford threw in 2013. He proposed to Detroit executives a detailed plan for improvement. Instead of tinkering with Stafford’s array of arm angles, Caldwell set out to correct his footwork and balance. At practice, the Lions videotape Stafford from a ladder 10 feet behind him, to capture his mechanics in a tight frame. As Caldwell has done with every quarterback from Manning to Jim Sorgi, he has assigned Stafford a series of drills intended to expunge from his muscle memory the impulse to throw flat-footed or off his back foot. “My warm-up has been the exact same every day since he’s gotten here,” Stafford said, referring to Caldwell. “I warm up the exact same way. I do the same drills almost every day. The repetition has made a difference.” Stafford is on pace to throw for, by far, the fewest touchdowns and yards of his career, and the Lions’ offense ranks only 23rd in the league in yards per play (5.2) and scoring average (20.1). But by taking fewer risks and minimizing mistakes, he almost always puts Detroit in position to win, or at least not to lose. He has thrown only 10 interceptions — the team has committed 16 turnovers, four fewer than the franchise’s single-season low — and the Lions have excelled late in games. Holding a 24-17 fourth-quarter lead against the Jets in Week 4, Detroit gained two first downs and ran out the clock. At a news conference then, Caldwell acknowledged feeling the need to teach the Lions how to win, saying he and his staff had stressed instilling poise at the end of games. At every practice, Caldwell simulates a potential game situation. On Fridays, he shows the team decisive moments — and mistakes — from around the league the previous week: poor clock management, unnecessary penalties, a player’s running out of bounds instead of taking more time off the clock. Remarking that teams often take on the personality of their coach, safety Glover Quin said the Lions did not panic when they trailed Atlanta, 21-0, at halftime (they won, 22-21), or New Orleans, 23-10, with 5 minutes 24 seconds left (they won, 24-23). After making a critical interception in last week’s victory against Minnesota, Quin referred to a quotation Caldwell had presented the night before: “Opportunities multiply when they are seized.” Even if the postseason beckons, Caldwell has conditioned his players to believe that tomorrow does not exist until midnight. He compared thinking about the playoffs to texting while driving — distorted vision, he called it. “We’re in this opportunity because we took advantage of the other opportunities,” Mathis said. “Now we just have to finish.” With Finnish. As they say in Helsinki, sisu.
