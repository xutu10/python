A Tough Decision Looms Over Frank Lampard
The former Chelsea star was to help launch New York City F.C. in 2015, but he has proven a valuable cog in Manchester City, and it may need him to stay.

LONDON —  As Frank Lampard approaches his final chapter as an athlete, his choices are the same and more of the same. From his schooldays to today, at age 36, the dream job has never wavered: To hold down the thing that defines a man in his chosen career, to earn a place in any top team that will employ him. Twenty years ago, Frank followed his father, Frank Lampard Sr., and his uncle, Harry Redknapp, as a player who climbed the ladder to join the East London team West Ham United. Then, when the Hammers needed money and  He not only learned from those teammates, he surpassed them and every other player who has ever worn the Chelsea shirt. Though a midfielder, and a mightily industrious one at that, he developed the knack of scoring goals. Lampard’s 211 goals in 648 games is, and probably always will be, the club record; he eclipsed even the great forwards in the team’s history. But the way it ended, without so much as a chance for Lampard and the fans to say goodbye, left much to be desired. By early summer, after Lampard retired from the English national team after the World Cup in Brazil, Chelsea effectively retired him when they signed Cesc Fàbregas from Barcelona. Lampard was then offered what many people saw as a sinecure. He became, Where does a player go to wean himself off the treadmill and await the new life across the Atlantic? The answer, a surprising one, is right back in the thick of things in the English and European leagues. New York City is a sister club of Manchester City F.C. They are both owned by the ruling family of Abu Dhabi, which is building a global network of teams in England, Australia, Japan and the United States. Despite Manchester City employing Yaya Touré, the Brazilians Fernando and Fernandinho, and James Milner in the “engine room” role that fits Lampard, he has broken into the City team in a way that complicates his release to New York when preseason training starts early next year. Having been given time to rest his old bones after the World Cup and recover from injury, Lampard has begun to look indispensable to Manchester City’s immediate ambitions. He may have started only four games and been involved as a substitute in seven more. But it is what he has done in those limited roles that is creating a problem. He has scored five goals, including one that thwarted his old team, Chelsea, in the Premier League. More than that, his Champions League experience has begun to look irreplaceable as the club tries to stay in the competition, which is regarded as the next great threshold for Abu Dhabi City to cross. With Touré struggling, neither of the Brazilians meeting expectations and with Milner a useful runner but not a player that Europeans fear, Lampard has stepped up to the midfield role he held at Chelsea. City is on the brink in the Champions League. Its home win against Bayern Munich in the last round, with Lampard the leader in central midfield, gives it a chance of qualifying for the next phase. If Lampard is fit, he will no doubt start the final group game next week at Roma’s Stadio Olimpico. Win, and City will advance. Lose, and City goes out. If it is a victory, then City’s need for Lampard’s knowledge will grow. He and the coach Manuel Pellegrini will talk then about extending his stay beyond the end of 2014. January will become a priority because Touré will then be in Africa, playing the Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast. The longer Touré’s nation lasts in that tournament, the later he returns, and quite possibly the more his body, already fatigued after a World Cup year, will need some respite. At that point, the two clubs belonging to the same owner and having the same chief executive must talk things over. Does Lampard go, or does he stay? People on both sides of the Atlantic are already asking the question. Lampard is cute enough to sidestep it by stating that being wanted is better than being told goodbye. He doesn’t have to say more at the moment. But we can see, every time he steps into City’s midfield and races forward in search of more goals, that he is still driven by the same urge, industry and energy he has always had. So Lampard’s America-bound flight is on hold. New York City’s coaching staff have been told they should expect to build around Lampard and Villa once training starts. And that might still happen. Time moves more quickly as a player ages. As Lampard considers his arrival in New York, Thierry Henry departs Major League Soccer. Henry, 37, was a more inventive player than Lampard, but the Frenchman played his 135th and final game for the Red Bulls on Saturday. Their flight paths could cross. Henry is headed back to England, hoping that his old club, Arsenal, will heed his open call to find a role — as a coaching assistant, an ambassador, anything so he can return to where he enjoyed his prime. Lampard’s situation is far different. He is hung in mid-Atlantic, wanted on both sides.
