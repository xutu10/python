New York Marathon 2014: A Lawyer by Day, a Runner Always
Annie Bersagel, an elite runner who is also an American lawyer working in Norway, will compete in her first New York City Marathon on Sunday.

Some people work full time as lawyers. Some are Olympic marathon contenders. Some are fluent in Norwegian as a second language. Annie Bersagel, a 31-year-old American who will compete among the elite runners at the  “I don’t know if I would have predicted that I’d be doing what I’m doing,”  Bersagel typically runs about an hour before and an hour after work each day, with long runs on the weekend. During much of the year, it is dark outside, and often freezing or worse. “It’s much colder here,” said Bersagel, who grew up in Colorado. “There can be a lot of ice, which is a bigger challenge than the snow.” This year, she said, she opted to do many of her long runs on a treadmill or an indoor track, some 20 miles or longer. Sometimes, she runs to work, toting a change of clothes and makeup in a backpack, a practice that has made her an authority on the virtues of workplace shower access and washing her clothes in the morning there so they are dry by the time she is ready to head home. “Machine-washable shift dresses work really well,” she said. In Norway, she runs with the  “Because she works, she’s on a very tight schedule,” Kvalheim said. “She’s had to be very organized. And she’s very dedicated to doing the work, which to run a marathon, you just have to be.” For all the scheduling hassles with her job, Kvalheim said that having something outside of running for Bersagel had been a blessing. “She’s extremely consistent,” he said. “And for a runner, that’s a really, really good thing.” Kvalheim will travel to New York this week for the race, his first time returning since his run nearly 40 years ago. “I imagine it’s changed a lot,” he said. For Bersagel, running came before law or finance. Her love of the sport began when she ran in middle and high school in Greeley, Colo., and she was a standout at Wake Forest, where she double-majored in politics and economics. In 2006, she was named the top N.C.A.A. female scholar-athlete and won the USA Half-Marathon Championship. But then she moved to Norway on a Fulbright Scholarship and to earn a master’s degree at the University of Oslo. It was through running there that Bersagel met her husband, Oyvind Heiberg Sundby, a physiology researcher and mountain runner. The two still train together most of the time. “I was only supposed to stay in Norway a month, but I stayed three years,” Bersagel said. In 2009, she moved to California to attend law school at Stanford and continued to train there with the aid of the university’s distance running coach, Dena Evans. (Sundby won a Fulbright to travel to California, allowing the couple to live there together.) When Bersagel interviewed for jobs, she said, she was concerned about how much to tell her potential employers about how deeply she was involved with running. “I know if someone Googles my name, the train has left the station,” Bersagel said. “The first thing that comes up are pictures of me running in my underwear.” Her LinkedIn profile At KLP For Bersagel, the two seemingly unrelated worlds of law and running are intertwined. “In competitive running, you fail all the time — and really, really publicly,” she said. “I think that’s something that can really help, and maybe I think more about being risk averse and when to be bolder because I’ve had those experiences of when things go really wrong.” That was the case at the 2012 Olympic marathon trials. Bersagel fell at about the one-mile mark. Although she pulled herself up, she said, she collided with another runner seven miles later and pulled her hamstring. She did not finish. Bersagel, who finished fourth in the 10,000 meters at the 2011 Pan-American Games, has her eyes on a spot on the United States team for the Rio Olympics in 2016. After winning the United States Marathon Championships last year she was the top American finisher at the 2014 I.A.A.F. World Half Marathon Championships in March, placing 13th over all. But it was her victory at the  Under rainy conditions and recovering from sickness, Bersagel won the race and hit a personal record of 2 hours 28 minutes 59 seconds. “It surprised me,” Bersagel said. “I was dreading the race and had that feeling of a lamb going into the slaughter. But it developed, and I was able to go for the win. If you look at it on paper, I shouldn’t have won that race. I think it threw some people off.” She said she had always dreamed of competing on the New York marathon course. She hopes that her presence on one of elite running’s largest and most storied stages will be inspiring for everyday runners with lives as cubicle dwellers. The lifestyle of a top female marathoner is difficult, with sponsors scant, punishing training and competition opportunities inherently rare. Many female athletes in their 30s are often cast aside. “A lot of people bloom later,” Bersagel said. “And having a shoe contract doesn’t necessarily make you the best.”
