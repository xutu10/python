The N.F.L.’s Cultural Juggernaut May Risk Market Saturation
Prognosticators of doom for the N.F.L. say the league is getting too greedy, particularly in the expansion of its television package.

When the Dallas Mavericks owner  N.F.L. owners, who were meeting when  Based on most financial barometers, the chance that the N.F.L. will implode in a decade appears slim. With $10 billion in revenue and a growing pool of money from long-term television, sponsorship and merchandise deals, the league is as healthy as it’s ever been. Pro football is by far the country’s most popular sport, television ratings are at record levels and Commissioner Roger Goodell is so confident that he plans to more than double revenue by 2027. But emperors often fail to recognize when their empires start to crumble. Decades ago, few foresaw baseball losing its status as the most popular sport because of changing demographics, steroids scandals and labor strife.  Given how many battles the N.F.L. has fought recently, it is at least worth asking if those who think the N.F.L. is getting too greedy have a point. Just this year, the league and its teams have been criticized for their stances on tolerance toward gays, bullying, names of team mascots that some find offensive and pay for cheerleaders. Goodell was jeered when it was reported that he  Retired players have criticized the N.F.L. for what they viewed as a paltry settlement in a class-action lawsuit over concussions. Perhaps the biggest and most long-lasting risk to the league comes from parents who, wary of the dangers of playing football, direct their children toward other sports. Already,  While troubling to the N.F.L.’s image and wallet, these woes could be a sign that the league has reached a tipping point or evidence that it is so large that it has become fly paper for many critical issues. “We’ve never seen an enterprise as successful as the N.F.L., so it’s hard to find any precedents,” said Robert Boland, who teaches sports management at New York University. “But the N.F.L. is the biggest league, and therefore it’s a target.” It may take years to prove whether Cuban’s forecast is correct, and, of course, he had his own reasons for making it. He predicted the N.F.L.’s demise just after the league sold the broadcast rights to Thursday night games to CBS, further expanding its reach into American homes. More fans watching football may mean fewer fans watching the N.B.A., something that would affect Cuban’s team. But Cuban’s broader point was that the league was in danger of saturating the market and diminishing the specialness that comes with watching football on Sundays. The league already has deals with CBS, ESPN, NBC, Fox, DirecTV and the NFL Network, which it owns. “They’re trying to take over every night of TV,” Cuban said. “It’s all football. At some point, the people get sick of it.” Brian Rolapp, the N.F.L.’s executive vice president for media, rejected that idea. The league’s media strategy is measured, he said. For six years, the league played eight games on Thursday nights before adding five more games. The deal with CBS was designed to reach more households than the NFL Network, which has shown the games. “We don’t haphazardly put things out,” he said. “It was a deliberate effort.” For years, critics have said that the N.F.L. was nearing a saturation point, yet each time more content has been produced, whether it was on talk radio, cable television, the Internet or elsewhere, it has been widely consumed. “If there is a saturation point, we haven’t seen it yet,” Rolapp said. The challenge has been to create something for everyone, from the most die-hard fans to more casual newcomers, Rolapp said, “but that’s a good problem that I’ll take all day.” Courting casual fans has its risks. In the 1990s, Nascar drew many new fans through televised races. But some of them moved on as the sport’s popularity crested. Years ago, many fans learned about the league because they played football or watched stories produced by NFL Films and a few television networks. But as the league has expanded, it has attracted more fans through video games, fantasy football and other arm’s length experiences. Some of them have never seen a game in person. These fans may, ultimately, prove fickle. Yet Neal Pilson, a former president of CBS Sports, said that determining a saturation point was the hardest question in television because you only know you have reached it several years after the fact. Pilson said he had predicted that television rights fees would peak in the mid-1980s, yet they have continued to climb, a sign that prognosticators of doom for the N.F.L. have been wrong before. “For years, there was a perception that there was a finite universe of dollars, but that’s not true,” he said of the amount of money spent on N.F.L. broadcast rights. For networks and their sponsors, “sports is the honey.”
