NYON, Switzerland — A Champions League draw heavy with reunions Monday paired Real Madrid and Barcelona with the same last 16 opponents as last season, and sent Arsène Wenger back to the club where he made his reputation. The defending champion, Madrid, will play Schalke a year after a 6-1 rout in Germany sparked a 9-2 aggregate victory. “We want to show that we’ve learned something,” Schalke Coach Roberto Di Matteo said. “We got the toughest rival.” Barcelona will once again travel first, on Feb. 24, to play Manchester City. Barcelona beat City, 4-1 on aggregate, at the same stage last season. “We have tried to improve at the back,” said Man City’s director of football, Txiki Begiristain, a former Barcelona player and director. “We are more solid than last season. The only reason to be happy is that I can go home.” The draw also paired Wenger, the manager of Arsenal, with his former team Monaco, where he rose to prominence by winning a French league title in 1988. “Wenger will be happy about the draw,” the Arsenal playmaker Mesut Özil wrote on his Twitter account. More repeat business will see Paris Saint-Germain again host Chelsea first, after the English club advanced from its quarterfinal series last season. “What happened last year was a good experience that shall not be repeated,” the team’s president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, said. Bayern Munich, which won the most recent of its five titles in 2013, will be away first against Shakhtar Donetsk. The runaway Bundesliga leader has never played the Ukrainian champion. “Donetsk is a big unknown for us,” Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said. “It won’t be so easy to prepare for these matches.” Shakhtar, which is based near Ukraine’s eastern border with Russia, is scheduled to host its match Feb. 17 in Lviv because of the conflict in its home city with separatist forces. Juventus will face Borussia Dortmund in a repeat of the 1997 final, which produced one of the biggest Champions League upsets. Back then, Dortmund beat the heavily favored defending champion, 3-1. Also, Bayer Leverkusen will face Atletico Madrid, and Basel will play Porto in a match of clubs that sustain good Champions League results despite often selling star players. “Every year they sell wonderful players at high prices and they stay sportively on a very high level,” said Basel’s club president, Bernhard Heusler, whose team ousted five-time champion Liverpool last week. “We have no fears, only a lot of respect.” The first legs will be played Feb. 17, 18, 24 and 25, with the return matches on March 10, 11, 17 and 18. The final is scheduled for June 6 at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin.
