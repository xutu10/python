Fantasy Football: Week 9 Player Tiers
With six N.F.L. teams off for a bye week, only 12 solid running back starts are available this week.

In this statistical model, I apply a clustering algorithm called  Quarterback Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck lead the way in Tier 1 this week. They’re joined by a red-hot Tom Brady, who has played at the top tier level since Week 4 against Kansas City, and Drew Brees, who gets a nice matchup against a Carolina defense that’s allowed 18.5 fantasy points per game to quarterbacks. Things are looking up for Nick Foles as Eagles’ center Jason Kelce could be returning this week. Foles has Tier 3 to himself. Ben Roethlisberger’s 500-yard and six-touchdown game last week bumps him to Tier 4. He is joined there by Carson Palmer and Tony Romo, but keep an eye on Romo’s status heading into the game. Running Back With six teams off for a bye, only 12 solid running back starts are available this week. Tier 3 is comprised of Lamar Miller, Mark Ingram, Giovani Bernard and Ahmad Bradshaw. The dropoff to Tiers 4 and 5 is substantial. In Tier 4 sits Ben Tate, who has managed only 62 yards on 31 rushing attempts in the last two weeks; Jerick McKinnon, who has yet to find the end zone this season; and Alfred Morris, who has been losing touches to Roy Helu whenever Washington falls behind. In Tier 5, Shane Vereen should play a role against Denver but Bill Belichick has been consistently unpredictable with his running back usage, and Denard Robinson appears to have secured the starting role in Jacksonville. Wide Receiver This should be the toughest bye week of the season for wide receivers, with eight top-shelf receivers unavailable. That leaves 13 solid receivers, ending in Tier 3 with DeSean Jackson, DeAndre Hopkins, and A.J. Green. The floor is quite low with most options in the Tier 4 range. Keenan Allen continues to get hurt by San Diego’s wide spread receiving options, Vincent Jackson has had many near-zero-point weeks, Larry Fitzgerald only has two good games and Terrance Williams is suddenly looking unreliable as the Cowboys struggled to pass against Washington. His quarterback, Tony Romo, is also questionable for Week 9. Tight End Despite Greg Olsen’s one-catch day against Seattle, experts still have him as a Tier 1 option along with Antonio Gates and the usual three suspects. After two quiet weeks, Larry Donnell returns to Tier 2 after posting 90 yards on seven catches. Jason Witten returns to Tier 3 after receiving a team-high eight targets for 70 yards and one touchdown. Heath Miller sits one tier lower in Tier 4 as it’s unlikely Ben Roethlisberger will throw for six touchdowns again.
