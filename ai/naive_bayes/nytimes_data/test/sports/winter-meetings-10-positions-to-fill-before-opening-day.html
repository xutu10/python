Winter Meetings: 10 Positions to Fill Before Opening Day
Though it is unwise to expect a flurry of transactions at this week’s winter meetings, here are 10 roster holes that need filling around the leagues.
===
John Lennon once pondered, paradoxically, how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall. Quite obviously, he was not referring to Albert Hall, who would play for the Atlanta Braves in the 1980s. But the idea of filling holes in a big building is in play starting on Monday. How many holes does it take to fill the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego? The question does not make perfect sense, but neither does the widespread perception of the baseball winter meetings. Perhaps an executive can learn something by sizing up his rival’s expressions, face to face, in a hotel suite. But phone calls, text messages and emails suffice just fine in executing a deal. Yet the tradition persists, mostly for reasons other than the flurry of transactions that folks tend to expect — but often do not get — from the winter meetings. Every team will descend on San Diego, and all with holes to fill, though not necessarily within the arbitrary constraints of the meetings, which end on Thursday. Here, then, are 10 holes to fill at the winter meetings — or, at least, before opening day. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS, THIRD BASE Sandoval could have returned to the Giants but sought a new challenge in Boston, where he can play designated hitter toward the end of a five-year, $98 million contract he signed with the Red Sox. That leaves the Giants, who made a nearly comparable offer, with a lot of cash to spend at a position, but with few clear options. Chase Headley, who finished the season with the Yankees but has spent most of his career in the National League West with San Diego, could be a fit. PITTSBURGH PIRATES, NO. 1 STARTER The Pirates made shrewd deals for both, but they need to find another bargain ace to stay in the playoff hunt. They gave a minor league deal last week to Clayton Richard, who missed last season with shoulder trouble but has twice been a 14-game winner for San Diego. He is worth a shot, but Pirates fans have a right to expect more than Richard and A. J. Burnett, who is back after leading the majors in walks, earned runs and losses in a grim one-year detour to Philadelphia. BOSTON RED SOX, ROTATION With so much pitching available in free agency, the Red Sox have options aside from Hamels. Yet their deals with Sandoval and Hanley Ramirez indicate that they will aggressively pursue another title, and they know they cannot win with their current rotation of Clay Buchholz, Joe Kelly and ... well, that’s about it. The Red Sox have been trying to lure Jon Lester back to Boston, but expect the rest of the top free-agent starters — James Shields, Brandon McCarthy, Ervin Santana, perhaps even Max Scherzer — to be linked to them, too. LOS ANGELES DODGERS, SHORTSTOP If they want a short-term space-holder for the top prospect Corey Seager — Kyle’s brother — the market is flush with options: Asdrubal or Everth Cabrera, Stephen Drew, Jed Lowrie. Giving a chance to Erisbel Arruebarrena, an internal option from Cuba already on a $25 million contract, would irritate copy editors but might be the safest bet. KANSAS CITY ROYALS, RIGHT FIELD, DESIGNATED HITTER, STARTER Two free agents with recent success in Kansas City — Santana and outfielder  TORONTO BLUE JAYS, CLOSER  Closer Casey Janssen is a free agent, and a possible setup man, Kendall Graveman, went to Oakland in the Josh Donaldson deal. Fortunately for Toronto, the free-agent market is stuffed with familiar relievers. Here are 10, in no particular order: Sergio Romo, David Robertson, Francisco Rodriguez, Rafael Soriano, Jason Grilli, Joba Chamberlain, Luke Gregerson, Pat Neshek, Jason Motte and Alexi Ogando. And do not forget John Axford, a native of Canada like Saunders, Pompey and the new Toronto catcher Russell Martin. BALTIMORE ORIOLES, DESIGNATED HITTER AND RIGHT FIELDER Buck Showalter, the Orioles’ manager, likes to say his team can “out-opportunity” others, even if it does not outspend them. This off-season gives Baltimore yet another chance to do so, but most high-impact bats are off the market. Perhaps the Orioles could trade for a spare outfielder from the Dodgers or the Braves, or sign Aoki or Colby Rasmus, the former Blue Jay, who struggles to reach base but could fit nicely at cozy Camden Yards.  OAKLAND ATHLETICS, MIDDLE INFIELD If General Manager Billy Beane is serious about winning in 2015, he must address second base and shortstop. The so-called “nerd power” of the bespectacled second baseman Eric Sogard produced a .567 O.P.S., the lowest in the majors for infielders with more than 300 plate appearances. Lowrie, the shortstop, is a free agent, leaving Nick Punto and Andy Parrino as the options of the moment. The Mets, with Wilmer Flores and Ruben Tejada at shortstop, can relate.
