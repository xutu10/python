Frank Torre, Inspiration to a Yankees Manager, Dies at 82
Torre is best remembered by New Yorkers for cheering from his hospital bed as the Yankees, led by his younger brother Joe Torre, won the 1996 World Series.

Frank Torre, an older brother of Joe Torre’s, played first base for seven seasons But he was remembered more by New Yorkers for the emotions stirred when he survived a heart transplant 39 years later and watched from a hospital bed the next day as his brother took the Yankees to his first World Series triumph as their manager. Frank Torre died Saturday in Palm Beach, Fla., Major League Baseball announced. He was 82. A granddaughter, Caroline Torre, said he had been given a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer last month. He had lived 18 years with a transplanted heart, and he underwent a kidney transplant in 2007. Joe Torre, nine years younger than Frank, regarded him as a mentor during their traumatic years growing up in their native Brooklyn when their father, Joseph Sr., a New York City police detective, long abused their mother, Margaret, and proved an intimidating figure to the five Torre children. Frank went on to become a baseball star at James Madison High School; Joe later played for St. Francis Prep. Frank signed with the Boston Braves in 1950 and made his major league debut in 1956 after the franchise moved to Milwaukee. Frank’s best major league season was in 1958, when he batted .309 and drove in 55 runs for the Braves, who lost to the Yankees in a repeat of their World Series matchup. He finished his career playing two seasons for the Philadelphia Phillies. Although Torre, a 6-foot-4 left-handed batter, showed good power in the 1957 World Series, he had only 13 home runs over all with a career batting average of .273. “When I was a teenager and my brother Frank was in the World Series in ’57 and ’58 against the Yankees, Braves winning in ’57 and the Yankees in ’58, little did I know the next time these two teams would meet in the World Series, I would be managing the Yankees,” Joe Torre said in his Hall of Fame induction speech in July. Frank Torre underwent a heart transplant at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan when the Yankees were on the brink of defeating the Atlanta Braves in the 1996 World Series. “I got a chance to live again,” he told The New York Times two years later. “The next night, I was able to see the winning game in the World Series.” He added: “I’ve had people tell me, ‘You gave me the courage to have a heart transplant.’ I’ve done pleas to donate organs. I’ve helped raise a lot of money. I’ve also had people tell me they wouldn’t be willing to donate their heart to someone waiting for a transplant. I just ask those people, ‘If somebody had a heart that could keep your son or daughter alive, how would you feel if that person refused to do it?’ ” He received his heart transplant from a 28-year-old man who died of a brain ailment, and his new kidney was donated by his daughter Elizabeth Torre. His son Frank Jr. briefly played minor league baseball.  Frank Torre, who died at a hospice, lived in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. In addition to his brother Joe, he is survived by five children, Frank Jr., Elizabeth and his other daughters Janet Torre, Kathryn Stewart and Margaret Torre, from his marriage to his wife, Anne, which ended in divorce; his sisters, Sister Marguerite Torre, a retired nun, and Rae Torre; and 12 grandchildren. In June 1996, while Frank’s heart was failing, the fifth Torre sibling, Rocco, died of a heart attack while watching a Yankees game on television.  Frank Joseph Torre was born on Dec. 30, 1931. He helped Joe, who became an All-Star catcher and infielder, and a manager for five teams and who is currently a senior baseball executive, reach a signing agreement in 1959 to play for the Milwaukee Braves’ organization, but they were never teammates. After his playing years, Frank worked for Rawlings Sporting Goods and was a board member of the Baseball Assistance Team, which helps needy former baseball figures. In his Cooperstown induction speech, Joe Torre said Frank “was my role model.” “It was tough love for a long time; it really was,” he said. Joe remembered how when George Steinbrenner offered him the Yankee managing job in 1996, Frank, thinking of Steinbrenner’s revolving managerial door, told him, “You’re crazy” to take it. But as Joe recalled, “He was the happiest person in the world when I got that World Series ring.”
