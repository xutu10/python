Steady Point for Knicks After a Restless Summer
Jose Calderon, acquired in a multiplayer deal with Dallas, is preparing for his new role by studying the team’s triangle offense.
===
WEST POINT, N.Y. —  Jose Calderon’s phone began to buzz shortly before midnight on June 25. He was about an hour from his home in Spain after taking a trip with his family, and he knew something was up because he was receiving dozens of text alerts and Twitter notifications. But Calderon was at the wheel, so whatever was happening had to wait. It was only when he pulled into his driveway that Calderon learned what everyone else already knew: The Dallas Mavericks had traded him to the  “I turned to my wife and said, ‘Look what they’re saying!’ ” Calderon recalled. “When you’re with a team and you’re comfortable there, everything seems O.K. You play a lot of minutes. You make the playoffs. You don’t miss practice — all of that stuff. So when you leave for the summer, you’re like, ‘See you next year!’ You expect maybe some changes, but nothing involving you.” It was still feeling surreal for Calderon when Phil Jackson, who had recently been installed as the Knicks’ president, called him that night. As Jackson welcomed him to the team, Calderon began to process his new reality. It did not take long for him to request old film of the triangle offense from the team’s video coordinators. He wanted to study his new role. “You’re not going to see too many dribbles,” Calderon said this week at the start of training camp. As the Knicks undergo an overhaul this preseason, Coach Derek Fisher is expected to lean on Calderon, 33, as a steadying influence at point guard. He is neither flashy nor outspoken. He protects the basketball and shoots well from the 3-point line. He is not exactly a defensive wizard, but he creates for teammates. “I try to make everybody feel comfortable out there,” said Calderon, whose contract will pay him $22 million through the 2016-17 season. “I don’t care about my shots or my points or my assists. It’s about playing the right way, trying to get everybody involved. And that’s what I’ve been doing for 10 years now.” It is another fresh start for Calderon, who has been employed by four teams since January 2013. After spending the first seven-plus seasons of his N.B.A. career with the Toronto Raptors, he was shipped to Detroit for a couple of months (where he stayed at a hotel) before signing as a free agent last summer with Dallas (where he bought a house). He was solid in Dallas, averaging 11.4 points and 4.7 assists a game. For the eighth straight season, he ranked among the league’s top four players in assist-to-turnover ratio. Bryan Colangelo, a former general manager of the Raptors, described Calderon as “extremely conservative” with the ball. There are worse things to be in the N.B.A. “Rarely does he get caught without a reasonable option to retain possession,” Colangelo said in an email. Calderon said his low turnover rate was the product of little more than his inability to throw what he described as “fancy passes.” He does not practice behind-the-back passes, between-the-legs passes or no-look passes. Instead, he said, he executes the fundamentals. His controlled style of play has gotten him this far. “If it’s not open, I know I can just wait for the next play,” he said. “Just try to make the easy pass. Sometimes it’s the easiest one that’s the best one.” As a child in Spain, Calderon looked up to his father, who played for the team in their hometown, Villanueva de la Serena. So while most of Calderon’s friends played soccer, basketball was the sport of choice in his household. The family had a hoop, and Calderon emerged as something of a prodigy. By 17, he had signed a professional contract with a team in Spain’s second division. With the Raptors, Calderon did have his moments amid the low hum of his steady if unspectacular play. He posted 19 assists in a game against the Chicago Bulls, made back-to-back playoff appearances in 2007 and 2008, and shot 98.1 percent from the free-throw line during the 2008-9 season. But after the Raptors acquired Kyle Lowry before the 2012-13 season, Calderon became expendable and was eventually shipped to the Pistons. “Please believe when I say that trading away a player that you like and trust is one of the most difficult things to do as a G.M.,” Colangelo said. In New York, a significant portion of the population might simply be pleased that Calderon is not Raymond Felton. If defense is a potential liability, at least Calderon has company. Last season, the Knicks ranked 24th in points allowed per 100 possessions. On Tuesday, Fisher made a statement by devoting the entire first practice of training camp — a full two and a half hours — to defense. “We need to play defense,” Calderon said. “I think we have enough talent on offense to score points.” Calderon joked that he had already been teammates with half of the roster, and it was only a slight exaggeration. He was with Shane Larkin and Samuel Dalembert in Dallas last season. He played with Pablo Prigioni for Tau Cerámica in Spain. Calderon also spent nearly seven seasons with Andrea Bargnani in Toronto, and Calderon said he felt he could help Bargnani elevate his play with the Knicks. Bargnani missed much of last season with an elbow injury, and he was lackluster when he was available, averaging 13.3 points while shooting 44.2 percent. “Hopefully I can help get him back to being the real Bargnani and being comfortable again,” Calderon said. “He can be amazing for us in this system.” Colangelo said that Calderon, too, was a good fit for the triangle, especially with his ability to play off the ball and shoot off the catch. “Look back at players like Steve Kerr and Derek Fisher as a case in point,” Colangelo said. Calderon said he was still learning all the nuances of this Fisher/Jackson production — the terminology, the schemes and everything that comes with something different. If Calderon does his job, he said, he will only make it easier for everybody else.
