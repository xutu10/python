Sunday’s Matchup: Giants (5-9) at Rams (6-8)
The Giants cannot run the ball effectively because the offensive line does not open enough holes, and their best back, Rashad Jennings, continues to be dogged by injuries.

4:05 p.m., Fox Matchup to Watch: The St. Louis defense has not allowed a touchdown in its last three games. Two of those games were shutouts for the Rams. But St. Louis, like most teams, has not yet faced Odell Beckham Jr. who has proved that he is a special talent. Eli Manning’s passing numbers have improved drastically since Beckham has found his footing in the Giants’ offense. The Giants cannot run the ball effectively because the offensive line does not open enough holes, and their best back, Rashad Jennings, continues to be dogged by injuries. Because of that deficiency, the Giants are expected to turn to Beckham early and often. Number to Watch: 30 The Giants’ rank among the 32 N.F.L. teams against the run. St. Louis is 26th in the league in passing yards. The Rams will probably try to run the ball, and who could blame them? Quotation of the Week: “If I told you that, I’d have to kill you.” PERRY FEWELL, the Giants’ defensive coordinator, when asked what he had done to make his unit more aggressive and successful during the last three games.
