A little more than 50 years after they skated in the 1964 Winter Games in Innsbruck, the American figure skaters Vivian and Ronald Joseph can finally call themselves Olympic bronze medalists — and they have the International Olympic Committee to back up their claim. The sister-brother pairs skating team placed fourth in those Games, but they were awarded bronze medals a couple of years later after it had been determined that the German team had signed a pro contract before the Games. At that time, amateur status was taken seriously, and the Germans were stripped of their silver medal. But in 1987, at an International Olympic Committee executive board meeting in Istanbul, the Germans were deemed “rehabilitated” and quietly re-awarded their silver medals. The official Olympic results have never reflected the Josephs as the bronze medalists or the Canadians as the silver medalists. Until Tuesday. After an inquiry by The New York Times, which resulted in  After much effort by the United States Figure Skating Association, the United States Olympic Committee, Skate Canada and the Canadian Olympic Association,  “I am ecstatic,” said Vivian Joseph, who lives in suburban Chicago. “I am sorry it wasn’t done sooner, but I am happy it is finally done.” Vivian and Ronald Joseph lamented that their coach,  Debbi Wilkes, who skated with Guy Revell for Canada in 1964, believed her cause was one that “had faded into the past long ago.” Over the years, she would be identified as a silver and bronze medalist and always felt awkward about discussing the matter publicly. She worked for Skate Canada before retiring this year and called the I.O.C.'s website update a “tremendous retirement gift.”
