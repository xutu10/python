Which Baseball Team Deserves a Title? Consult the Suffering Index
Rating the baseball playoff teams based on whether their fans have waited a long time for a championship and whether a title is noticeably absent from their star players’ résumés.
===
Well, New York baseball fans, it happened again. And this time, it is more complicated. For the second autumn in a row, neither the  So which team deserves your temporary affection? Maybe you root for alumni, like the former Yankee Don Mattingly, who manages the Los Angeles Dodgers. Maybe you like those sharp green-and-gold uniforms of the Oakland Athletics. Or maybe you just really like Little Caesars Pizza, whose founder, Mike Ilitch, also owns the Detroit Tigers. But a more logical method, perhaps, would be to rate all the teams based on two factors: fan suffering and individual legacies. That is, has the city or region waited a long time for a championship, or dealt with especially devastating losses along the way? And does the team have players so transcendent that the absence of a championship would be noticeable late in their careers? You know fan bases like this. Remember the civic catharsis in Boston in 2004, and on the South Side of Chicago in 2005? And you know players like these: Ty Cobb and Ted Williams, Ernie Banks and Robin Yount, Barry Bonds and Ken Griffey Jr. All were remarkable players who did just about everything except win a title. So which city yearns most for a World Series victory? And which players are most in need of a legacy-defining October? Here is an admittedly arbitrary look at the field, with rankings assigned (1 to 10) for each of the factors. The lower the total, the stronger the emotional pull. St. Louis Cardinals (20 — 10th in fan points, 10th in legacy points) This is not meant to disrespect the Cardinals. This is the team everyone aspires to be: rich tradition, deep farm system, reasonable payroll, loyal fans, star players. The Cardinals’ front office makes all the right moves. Their players are generally bright and likable. But they really do seem to win all the time. They’re more like the Yankees than the Yankees these days. The Cardinals have won four pennants in the last 10 years, and World Series championships in 2006 and 2011. Their best players, Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright, are well decorated. Their fans are hardly suffering, and their best players’ legacies are secure. San Francisco Giants (18 — 9th in fan points, 9th in legacy points) The Giants are pretty much the West Coast version of the Cardinals, but with fewer overall World Series appearances recently and more luckless decades before this one. Bruce Bochy will enter Cooperstown someday based partly on his championships in 2010 and 2012, and mainstays like Buster Posey, Tim Lincecum, Pablo Sandoval and Madison Bumgarner were on both teams. If the Giants do win, though, it will be an especially nice moment for Tim Hudson, the veteran right-hander who leads all active pitchers in victories but has never reached the World Series. Washington Nationals (13 — 7th in fan points, 6th in legacy points) We get it — the nation’s capital had no baseball team for 33 years. And the Washington teams before that had failed to win a World Series since 1924. That is an epic drought, and the Redskins, the Bullets/Wizards and the Capitals haven’t won in decades. But this is just the 10th season for this franchise in Washington, and this is a year with several other long-suffering fan bases on alert. The Nationals’ most recognizable players, Bryce Harper and Stephen Strasburg, must add a bit to their résumés before fans grow too concerned with their ring collection. The standouts Jordan Zimmermann, coming off a final-day no-hitter, and Ryan Zimmerman have combined for 18 years in the organization, and that counts for something. Los Angeles Angels (11 — 8th in fan points, 3rd in legacy points) Anaheim loves a winner. In all but one of the Angels’ playoff seasons, the team ranked among the top three in the American League in attendance. The exception was 2002, the one season the Angels advanced to the World Series. They beat the Giants in seven games, to the beat of Thunderstix from their fans, setting off a renaissance in the Orange County stands. Yet even with stellar attendance marks, a 12-year wait is not too long by comparison. The Angels get a much higher ranking in legacy points, mainly because Mike Trout is the best player in baseball. Trout is only 23, so, in theory, he has many years to win a title. But opportunities can prove elusive, and two of the game’s greatest players — Hank Aaron and Willie Mays — won their only championship at age 23. So there is no time like now for Trout to win his. Baltimore Orioles (11 — 4th in fan points, 7th in legacy points) The Orioles have not appeared in the World Series since winning it in 1983. But they still draw 10,000 fewer fans per game, on average, than they did in 2000, when they finished fourth. Their N.F.L. neighbors, the Ravens, have raised two Lombardi Trophies since then. But this is a proud old baseball town, with smart fans and a still-gorgeous ballpark that deserves to host the World Series. None of the active players, except perhaps Adam Jones, seem likely to wind up in a Hall of Fame debate someday. The legacy points here go to Manager Buck Showalter and General Manager Dan Duquette, who helped significantly in building championship teams in other jobs, only to be fired before reaching glory. Oakland Athletics (10 — 6th in fan points, 4th in legacy points) The Oakland fans put up with a lot: a ritzy neighbor across the Bay, a football stadium with few modern amenities, a quarter-century without a title and seemingly annual letdowns in October. The A’s have gone a decade since ranking in the top half in the A.L. in attendance, but the fans who show up are loud and spirited, with clever signs and rituals. None of the players would rank as a headliner in the majors, except perhaps Jon Lester, who has won two championships with Boston. But the A’s rank high in legacy points because of their general manager, Billy Beane, whose innovations on a low budget have been celebrated in a book and a movie — without a proper ending. Beane has called the postseason a crapshoot, but to many he still needs a ring for total validation of his methods.  Kansas City Royals (9 — 1st in fan points, 8th in legacy points) The Royals have gone longer without a playoff appearance than any other team in the four major North American sports. Their last was in 1985, when they won their only championship. The N.F.L.’s Chiefs have not helped local fans much, either, having gone without a Super Bowl appearance since January 1970. The Royals’ roster has few players who resonate nationally. There are great stories within the clubhouse: Raul Ibanez, seeking his first title at age 42; James Shields, the stalwart right-hander who came close with Tampa Bay; Alex Gordon, the Nebraska kid whose brother is named for George Brett. But if you’re a casual fan rooting for the Royals, you’re probably rooting mostly for the city — and that’s a very good reason. Pittsburgh Pirates (7 — 2nd in fan points, 5th in legacy points) The Pirates’ fans inserted themselves into the action last October, hooting at Cincinnati’s Johnny Cueto in the wild-card game until he dropped the ball on the mound and served up a homer to Russell Martin one pitch later. The Pirates won that game, but they’re still waiting for their first victory in a playoff series since 1979 — and, of course, they endured 20 consecutive losing seasons before last year. The roster revolves around center fielder Andrew McCutchen, the reigning N.L. most valuable player. The honor vaulted McCutchen to a new plateau of stardom — a marriage proposal on “Ellen,” a “SportsCenter” ad, a Sports Illustrated cover — and a championship in Pittsburgh could put him on a Cooperstown track. Los Angeles Dodgers (6 — 5th in fan points, 1st in legacy points) The Dodgers waited until 1955 for their first championship in Brooklyn, then won three in their first eight seasons in Los Angeles. Three pennants followed in the 1970s, then two championships in the 1980s. But their fans have not seen a World Series since 1988, and this year many could not even watch the team on local cable. If that doesn’t move you, how about Mattingly, who has never reached the World Series in any capacity? His playing career fit snugly between the Yankees’ World Series appearances in 1981 and 1996, and his coaching years in pinstripes did not coincide with a World Series. Then there is Clayton Kershaw, the game’s best pitcher. The last four seasons have put Kershaw in the pantheon of greats, and it would be thrilling to see him in his first World Series. Detroit Tigers (5 — 3rd in fan points, 2nd in legacy points) The danger with these Tigers is the Buffalo Bills syndrome: When they reach the World Series, it tends to be one-sided against them. The Tigers lost to St. Louis in five sloppy games in 2006, and they were swept by San Francisco in 2012. But it has been 30 years since the Tigers’ last championship, and the team has a nine-year streak of ranking in the top half of A.L. teams in attendance. The roster is loaded with players whose legacies demand a championship: the Cy Young Award winners Justin Verlander, David Price and Max Scherzer, as well as the threesome of Torii Hunter, Victor Martinez and Joe Nathan, who have 16 combined All-Star selections but no World Series appearances. Miguel Cabrera won a ring as a 20-year-old rookie for the Florida Marlins in 2003. But he will have a Tigers cap on his Hall of Fame plaque someday, and his career will be incomplete if he does not carry them to a championship.
