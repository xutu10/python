Denver Broncos wide receiver Wes Welker, reinstated after the N.F.L. agreed to a new drug policy, practiced for the first time since Sept. 1. Welker’s four-game suspension for testing positive for a banned amphetamine in the off-season was essentially cut in half, and he will be eligible to play Sunday at Seattle. Welker sustained a concussion on Aug. 23 in a preseason game against Houston, his third head injury in a 10-month span. But he has been cleared medically, so he was able to get right back on the field upon his reinstatement. Welker was originally barred until the Broncos’ Oct. 12 game against the Jets. N.F.L. FINES KAEPERNICK  Kaepernick reiterated that he did nothing wrong when he and Chicago defensive end Lamarr Houston confronted each other, pointing to Houston’s comments that Kaepernick did not say anything offensive or out of line. “It will be appealed,” said Kaepernick, who shoved Houston. “I didn’t say anything. Lamarr Houston said I didn’t say anything.” The side judge Laird Hayes threw a flag for unsportsmanlike conduct. San Francisco Coach Jim Harbaugh sought his own explanation and has heard from the N.F.L. that there would not be a change to the call.  FLACCO MISSES WORKOUT  He is expected to play Sunday against Cleveland, but his absence was unusual. Flacco has not missed a start since launching his career the first week of his rookie season in 2008. He has played in 98 straight games. “It was weird,” defensive tackle Haloti Ngata said, adding that he and Terrell Suggs “were thinking, We’ve never been in a practice without Joe Flacco being out there.” “Whatever’s going on, hopefully all the best for him,” Ngata said. Coach John Harbaugh, asked what had happened to Flacco, said: “I don’t know. I haven’t talked to him. This is my answer for the year. You’re going to keep asking; I’m going to give you the same answer. There will be an injury report later, though.”
