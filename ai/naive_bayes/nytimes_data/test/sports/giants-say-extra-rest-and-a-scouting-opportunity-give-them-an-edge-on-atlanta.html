Giants Say Extra Rest and Scouting Opportunity Give Them Edge on Falcons
Coach Tom Coughlin of the Giants, who are feeling a sense of rebirth after winning a second straight game on Thursday, used Sunday’s day off for a “live scout” of Atlanta.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —  The Giants woke Monday feeling more or less the same about themselves, while the league around them had changed. That is one of the benefits of wrapping up the workweek on Thursday night and basking in the long weekend while other teams jostle about on Sunday. By late that night, after the Dallas Cowboys’ takedown of New Orleans, the landscape of the N.F.C. East had been altered significantly, and the Giants were left feeling fairly comfortable about where they stood. The Cowboys, who some commentators had projected would finish last in the division, were 3-1 and showcasing a freewheeling running attack and a boorish offensive line. But the Philadelphia Eagles were also supposed to be the most talented point-scoring team in football, and their offense was shut out in a 26-21 loss to San Francisco. And then, trailing just off both of them, is a jelling, rejuvenated, explosive and undaunted Giants team that, at 2-2 and well rested, is feeling a newfound sense of rebirth. “That’s football — you don’t know who’s going to be the hot team, the hot division,”  After grumbling through some injury updates as he addressed reporters after practice Monday, Coach  “That’s the direction we’re headed in,” Coughlin said. “We’re trying like heck to be the best we can be. We’re trying to improve on a weekly basis. We’re trying to do the things we didn’t do in the beginning. “We’ve had some take-aways, we’ve had pretty good control of the ball, with the exception of the one the other day. We’ve done some things that worked together as a team, so I’m hoping that continues.” Sunday’s day off afforded what Coughlin called a “live scout” of the next opponent, Atlanta, something that can be more instinctive, more reactive and basic but helpful nonetheless. He said there was a checklist of observations he prepared for live scouts, noting broader themes, like strengths, weaknesses, successes and failures. Likewise, Manning said he had watched Atlanta being thrashed by Minnesota on television and then again on film Sunday night, taking advantage of the additional day of mental preparation. “I definitely watched a little bit but also watched their previous games on tape already to get a better idea of what they’re doing,” Manning said. “You get a little bit better of an idea watching the game film than the TV.” The Giants’ task will be to keep its offense humming as it has the previous two games, averaging 434 yards per game on 5.9 yards per play, as opposed to 269 yards per game and 4.2 yards per play during the first two games. Entering Monday, only two other teams, Indianapolis and Atlanta, had put up more total yards in the previous two weeks than the Giants. Those are the two top-scoring teams in the N.F.L. And the Giants could add yet another playmaking dimension with the potential debut of receiver Odell Beckham Jr., the first-round draft pick who has been sidelined with a hamstring injury since the start of training camp. Beckham said he planned to practice fully this week, with the hope that Sunday will bring his debut in the lineup. “I’m really just trying to learn the playbook, and wherever I fit in is where I fit in,” Beckham said. “I don’t really see a need to change. Don’t fix it if it isn’t broken. I feel like we’ve been doing a great job on offense the past couple weeks.” But the Giants will have to contend with a familiar face lining up on the other side. Osi Umenyiora, who won two Super Bowls with the Giants, plays his former team for the first time. More than likely, he will be trying to blow through left tackle Will Beatty, a familiar practice opponent. Beatty considered Umenyiora a mentor when he arrived. “This will be an opportunity to show him how far I’ve come,” Beatty said with a smile. EXTRA POINTS Defensive back Jayron Hosley came back to practice Monday and is eligible to return after serving a four-game suspension for violating the league’s substance abuse policy. Hosley, a third-round draft selection in 2012, appeared in five games last season. The Giants have been granted a one-game roster exemption, giving them until 4 p.m. next Monday to place him on the 53-man roster. “It’s been four weeks, but I feel good,” Hosley said. “I’m healthy, I feel strong, I’m focused, so I’m ready to go.”
