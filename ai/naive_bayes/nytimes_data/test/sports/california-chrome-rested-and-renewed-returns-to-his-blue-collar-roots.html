Chrome, Rested and Renewed, Returns to His Blue-Collar Roots 
There is some poetry to choosing the Pennsylvania Derby on Saturday for California Chrome’s return to the racetrack; the colt was built on a blue plate budget, boasts blue-collar roots and has thrived in middle-class ZIP codes.

BENSALEM, Pa. — When last seen, neither California Chrome nor Steve Coburn was doing very well. California Chrome, the  On Thursday morning, the man and his horse looked just fine. The Stetson was still atop Coburn’s head, his brush mustache was trimmed to perfection, and once more the smile and the straight talk that came from behind it were as sparkling as they had been for all but those three minutes or so post-Belmont. His colt, Chrome, was even better. He looked as if he had grown boulders under his chestnut coat, and skipped over the racetrack as if he were spring loaded. He was a new animal, in the same way teenagers leave childhood behind: If the colt could talk, you would hear that his voice had changed. “He put on about 60 pounds when he was on vacation; it looks like he really matured,” Coburn said. “He needed a break, he really did. It was good for the entire team, to wind down.” California Chrome spent most of his summer at the ranch where he was born in the San Joaquin Valley, letting the flesh of his right front heel grow back and a gash on his leg heal; he sustained those wounds when another horse stepped on him moments after he broke from the gate at Belmont Park. At the ranch, the colt was merely a horse wandering the fields — the kind of convalescence old-school horsemen like his trainer, Art Sherman, prescribe after a tough and talented horse like Chrome runs seven races (winning six of them), against top-flight talent, in a little more than five months. And Coburn, after a scolding or 12 from his wife, Carolyn, and a tearful apology on a nationally televised morning show, returned to his home in Nevada and his life as a machinist, receding into anonymity after living the part of the clairvoyant owner of America’s horse. He did, after all, predict that California Chrome was going to win the Derby when the little guy was a day old. “I tell people that unless you’ve been in my position, with the highs and lows, it’s tough,” Coburn said. “The adrenaline and the emotion is tough. It’s over and done with. Now, it’s another place, another race.” The place is Parx Racing, a track hard off the Pennsylvania Turnpike and across the parking lot from one of the Northeast’s highest-grossing casinos. It was once called Philadelphia Park, and had a turn in the limelight as the home track of Smarty Jones, who suffered the only loss of his career in the 2004 Belmont when Birdstone caught him in the final strides to deny him a Triple Crown. The race is the Pennsylvania Derby on Saturday, a respectable stop for 3-year-olds, with a rich $1 million purse, though hardly a must for stars of the Triple Crown series. But there is some poetry to Sherman, Coburn and his co-owner Perry Martin choosing this racing backwater for California Chrome’s return to the racetrack. The colt was built on a blue-plate budget, comes from blue-collar roots and has thrived in middle-class ZIP codes. He is Californian, after all — he is only the fourth California-bred horse ever to capture the Derby — and his home base of Los Alamitos, cozy as it is, is predominately a track for less glamorous and far less lucrative quarter horses. His mother, Love the Chase, was a small filly who managed a single victory in six races in racing’s lowest levels. Coburn and Martin bought her for $8,000 and bred her to the stallion Lucky Pulpit, whose bargain-basement $2,000 stud fee made sense considering he had only three victories in his 22 starts. In March, after California Chrome ran away with the San Felipe Stakes and stamped himself an authentic Derby contender, his team again showed a gambler’s resolve, but this time with far more chips on the table. They turned down $6 million for half-ownership of the colt, they said, because the would-be owner wanted to take him away from Sherman and run him under his own silks. Well, that decision turned out fine as the colt has earned more than $3.5 million in purses and will plump his value as a stallion with every subsequent victory. Now they are here, playing with house money. Win or lose, Coburn, Martin and Sherman get $200,000 for showing up, as part of a bonus program racing officials here drew up to attract the best 3-year-olds in training. (They get $100,000 for winning the Derby, and another $100,000 for the Preakness.) With the $5 million Breeders’ Cup Classic six weeks from now as their ultimate goal, their choices were stark: Stay in California and run next week in the $300,000 Awesome Again Stakes against older horses, or get on a plane headed East for guaranteed money, competing against contemporaries for a $600,000 first-place check. California Chrome is the even-money favorite to win on the morning line, although the Haskell winner, Bayern (7-2), and the West Virginia Derby victor, Tapiture (5-1), should make him work. “It dropped in our lap,” Coburn said. “He won’t have to run his guts out against older horses. We were fools not to do it if the horse was ready. He’s fit. He’s happy. He’s ready to go.”
