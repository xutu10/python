Loser’s Mentality? Knicks Puzzle Out Phil Jackson’s Remark
Before their loss Tuesday — their ninth straight — the Knicks faced questions about what they perceived Jackson meant when he said the team was developing a loser’s mentality.
===
NEW ORLEANS —   This was only the latest attempt to explain the Knicks’ poor play this season. If the premise felt a little overwrought, perhaps a bit difficult to believe, so too has been the team’s abysmal start. The rhetoric emerged when the players were queried about the hypothesis the club’s president,  Carmelo Anthony “When it comes to having a loser’s mentality,” Anthony said before the team’s morning shootaround at Smoothie King Center, “what I can take from that is, I think, when you lose games, consistently, the same way that we’re losing games, I think you get accustomed to — or it’s easy to get accustomed to — trying not to lose rather than trying to win games. “You try to figure everything out, and you’re worried about not losing a basketball game, rather than figuring it out, and figuring out how to win basketball games,” he went on. “I think that’s where we’re at as a basketball team right now.” It was where the Knicks remained Tuesday night, as they lost, 104-93, to the New Orleans Pelicans, extending their losing streak to nine games. It was a limp performance, whatever the players’ mentality. The Pelicans’ size proved too much, as they scored 54 points in the lane and outrebounded the Knicks by 43-30. “It’s repetitive: same thing, different day,” Anthony, who had 17 points and 8 rebounds, said after the game. Amar’e Stoudemire, who led the Knicks with 26 points and 5 blocks, compared it to the movie “Groundhog Day.” The Knicks, who are now 1-10 on the road, play the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday, and a loss would give them their first 10-game losing streak since the 2005-6 season. As the Knicks have spilled to a 4-19 start — the franchise’s worst 23-game record to begin a season — various issues of personnel and shortcomings in talent seem to have been laid bare. And yet Jackson has asserted that the problems are not with the team’s talent or skill, but with its mentality. In that vein, when Derek Fisher, the team’s first-year coach, was asked about the “loser’s mentality” comment, he reverted to a point he had made on numerous occasions this season: that his players were still reluctant to commit wholeheartedly to the system he and Jackson have been working to install. “I think that we’re allowing ourselves to be boxed in to what the team used to be,” Fisher said. “We’re establishing a completely new way of playing basketball and building a new team in terms of how we want to be the New York Knicks.” But changing is hard, Fisher acknowledged. Despite their historically poor start, the Knicks have leaned on the fact that they have been competitive in many games, pointing out that they have lost because of failures of execution in crucial moments rather than being comprehensively blown out. At the same time, statements from the team’s management and players have revolved around vague qualities like character and disposition. According to them, if the team adopts a better mind-set, plays with more passion and has more fun, among other things, it will win more games. “We’ve got to find passion,” Stoudemire said. “Once we find passion for the game, everything falls into place.” Stoudemire’s logic could come across as simplistic, but he and his teammates might be excused. There is only so much to say day after day, night after night, when the results are so repetitively bad. Trying to remain positive amid the slump, then, has been precisely the challenge, according to Anthony. “We’re going to get upset, we’re going to get mad, when we lose basketball games, and you’re going to get upset when you look at 4-18 on the record,” Anthony said before the game. “That becomes natural as a competitor. We just can’t allow that to sink in, and every time we lose a game everybody’s getting down and angry and upset and frustrated, and it carries over to the next game and the next game. “That’s just something that can’t happen,” he added. Jackson also pointed out again that Anthony, one of the league’s best scorers, needed to “flesh out” his game. Anthony said he had not heard Jackson’s most recent comments, but he said the effort was there. “That conversation came earlier in the season, when we talked before,” Anthony said. “As far as doing those things, I go out there and try to do them: offensive rebounds, share the ball, play D, be there for my team and do some of the little things other than score the basketball.” He added: “Me being a big part of this team and this organization, I’ll always put that onus on myself and put that on my shoulders and feel like I have to do more. If I do more, I feel like everybody else will do more.”
