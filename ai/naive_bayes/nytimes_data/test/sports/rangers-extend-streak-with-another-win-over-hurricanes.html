Ryan McDonagh’s first-period goal held up, and Cam Talbot made 18 saves as the  The Rangers completed a sweep of the home-and-home weekend series against the Eastern Conference-worst Hurricanes, who lost for the eighth time in nine games. The Rangers defeated the Hurricanes, 3-2, in a shootout Saturday in Raleigh, N.C. “We’ll take the two wins, kind of in different fashions,” McDonagh said. “We did a good job of containing them and eliminating their opportunities.” Talbot is 3-3-1 this season backing up Henrik Lundqvist, and all three victories have been shutouts. “You never want to be the guy to come in and break the winning streak,” Talbot said. “I didn’t really have to do a whole lot tonight; the guys in front of me did an unbelievable job.” McDonagh scored his second goal of the season 4 minutes 10 seconds into the game. He hit the puck past goaltender Anton Khudobin, who has yet to win this season (0-8-2). McDonagh, the Rangers’ captain, has points in seven of 10 games since returning to the lineup Nov. 28 after missing 11 games with a shoulder injury. Mats Zuccarello and Derek Stepan assisted on McDonagh’s latest goal. The Rangers (17-10-4) have won 10 of their last 13 games to keep pace with Washington in a tight Metropolitan Division race. The Rangers will host the Capitals on Tuesday before the three-day Christmas break. The shutout was the Rangers’ league-leading eighth this season. It is the first time the team has eight shutouts in its first 31 games since 1928-29, according to information the team received from the Elias Sports Bureau. “We are no different than any team in the N.H.L.; you can’t win if you don’t get goaltending,” Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault said. Without its top scorer, Jiri Tlusty, who has an upper body injury, Carolina was outshot by the Rangers, 31-18. Sunday’s game was the Rangers’ first home contest since Dec. 8, when they began their winning streak with a 4-3 overtime victory against Pittsburgh. The Rangers then won three straight in Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary. On Sunday, the Rangers were without forward Lee Stempniak and defenseman John Moore. The Rangers have outscored opponents, 20-8, in their six-game winning streak and have allowed two goals or fewer in each of the last five contests. The Hurricanes have little to focus on except working to reverse their fortunes. “Our goaltender held us in the game,” defenseman John-Michael Lies said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t get one for him.” The Rangers have won 14 of their last 15 games against the Hurricanes, including eight straight at home since Feb. 22, 2011.
