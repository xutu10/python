Colts (5-3) at Giants (3-4)
Matchups to watch in Monday’s game between the Giants and the Colts.
===
8:30 p.m., ESPN Matchup to watch: Hilton, the  Number to watch: That is the rookie running back Andre Williams’s average yards per carry this season. With the starting running back Rashad Jennings still sidelined with a knee injury, Williams is going to be charged with giving the Giants’ offense balance on the ground. He, and the offensive line, need to find a way to improve that average yards per rushing attempt if the Giants are going to have a chance against Indianapolis. Quotation of the Week ‘We’re all kind of waiting for him to come out of his shell and be more consistent so he can play more.’ PERRY FEWELL, the Giants’ defensive coordinator, on the second-year defensive end Damontre Moore. Last week, General Manager Jerry Reese said he would like to see Moore on the field more often.
