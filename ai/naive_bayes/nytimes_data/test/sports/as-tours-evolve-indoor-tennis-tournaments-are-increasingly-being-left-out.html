As Tours Evolve, Indoor Tennis Tournaments Are Increasingly Being Left Out
While there used to be a month or more of indoor tournaments leading into the year-end finals for both the men and the women, the tours’ detours into Asia after the United States Open have created a more abbreviated indoor season.

PARIS —  Professional tennis is increasingly finding sunshine preferable to having a roof overhead. In 1994, 25 men’s and 16 women’s tour events were held indoors. Two decades later, those numbers are 15 and 8. Stacey Allaster, the chief executive of the WTA, said the growth of outdoor fall tennis in Asia had reduced the number of indoor tournaments once available to players at that time of year. She also acknowledged that the more spacious outdoor events allowed for larger fields, which the tour wants. “The principles of calendar management have been geographical and surface flow, not necessarily indoor-outdoor,” Allaster said. “And I think the reality of it is that as we have grown, we want larger draw sizes, more content, more matches. Very few indoor facilities can hold those big events.” Serena Williams “Like, why didn’t I play indoor tennis when there was more tournaments around?” she said. “I think I played Zurich once and Filderstadt once. I would have been amazing in those tournaments; it was so fast. It was my surface. But I was young.” Williams won the only indoor tournament she played this year,  On Sunday, the top-ranked man,  While there used to be a month or more of indoor tournaments leading into the year-end finals for both the men and the women, the tours’ detours into Asia after the  Roger Federer, who grew up in frosty Switzerland, enjoyed playing indoors more frequently earlier in his career. He said he felt that the notion of an indoor season was lost when the October Masters event moved from an indoor arena in Madrid to an outdoor complex in Shanghai. “To me now it’s outdoor Shanghai, and then you come over here and maybe play one or two max, maybe three with the World Tour Finals,” Federer said, adding, “But still, nevertheless, I mean, I enjoy playing the indoor season as much as I can because that’s what I did very often when I was younger in February, and then also at the end of the year.” Andy Murray, who played much of his early tennis in his native Scotland, where the cold mist kept him inside for much of the year, still plays frequently indoors. This fall, he won in Vienna and Valencia before reaching the quarterfinals in Paris. “I guess it’s like some of the Spaniards growing up on clay,” he said. “I grew up on indoor hardcourts. So that would be my most natural surface, really.” Murray said a roof had a way of intensifying a match. “I always think if you get a good atmosphere indoors, you feel it more because you don’t lose any of the noise out of the stadium,” he said. “Everything stays inside, and it always seems like it’s a bit louder.” Chris Evert, a Floridian who said she thought she had an advantage when outdoor matches brought heat, wind, and rain, nevertheless fondly recalled playing in Madison Square Garden. “You can really hear the emotions of the crowd,” she said. “You can feel them in outdoors, but you could hear them also in indoors. Every rustle, every noise comes out magnified. There’s a little more feeling of anticipation and excitement indoors than there is outdoors.” The Garden, once a home to both tours, now hosts tennis for one night a year, and it is only an exhibition. There are no more indoor tournaments in Los Angeles, San Jose or Philadelphia, either. Aside from the year-end finals on both tours, the only large tournament held indoors on either tour is the Paris Masters. Though the secondary court built atop an ice rink in Paris can feel claustrophobic, the main Court Central provides a theater on par with any in the sport, with an elaborate light show set to modern electronic music. Brief animations appear on the overhead scoreboard for break, set and match points. Guy Forget, the tournament director, said he wanted to present an experience different from that found at the tradition-rich  “The matches at Roland Garros are long, on clay, long rallies,” Forget said. “We want to make it faster, more exciting. Roland Garros, we have a heritage of tradition and history, and here we want to break that code.” He added: “We’re indoors with loud music, light show; there’s graffiti. And I think it’s good to treat tennis differently. We have a different crowd as well here, and I think it’s nice to realize that tennis can be just as exciting and just as good when treated differently.” Forget said he feared that the homogenization of the tour could lead to a more “monolithic” style of play. He believes that indoor play should be cherished and preserved. “When I played, I always enjoyed a lot playing indoors, because one of the things we face throughout the year is tough conditions,” he said. “You play New Zealand and Australia, you play in extreme heat, wind, sometimes rain when you play in London. You have to wait; matches are postponed. There are bad bounces on clay, on grass. “Indoors, the light is good, no wind, no sun, no temperature problems. When you play indoors, especially in the big tournaments, it’s just as perfect as you can get it.”
