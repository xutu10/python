For Young Soccer Players, How Much Is Too Much?
Raheem Sterling, who is being counted on at Liverpool, was left out of the English national team's starting lineup after he told his coach he was tired.
===
LONDON —  Raheem Sterling was, for one night, the darling of the World Cup. Essentially a winger, but deployed in Manaus, Brazil, in a central role by England to surprise Italy’s renowned defenders with his quick, daring and intuitive runs, he reminded many a Brazilian of Garrincha, the “Little Bird” who played so thrillingly for the national team fifty years before. Four months after that steamy and memorable evening in Manaus, Sterling is becalmed. He was left out of England’s starting eleven against Estonia in Tallinn on Sunday after telling the coach he felt tired. Sterling is 19. His absence from the start of the European qualifier has stirred a polemic throughout his sport, and not just in England. Some people sneer and wonder how a teenager can be tired playing twice, or at the most, three times a week for a salary that many would die for. Others fear for him. They argue that the expectations placed upon a youth playing a man’s game for Liverpool and for England might very well lead to burnout. And yet others view this more cynically. They hear the Liverpool manager and the England manager voicing different opinions that boil down to the old club versus country debate. Liverpool depends on Sterling, particularly after selling Luis Suárez to Barcelona and losing Daniel Sturridge to a thigh injury suffered last month while playing for the English national team. The club needs Sterling’s sharpness and his ability to open up defenses now more than ever. Toward the end of last season, when the Reds were cherishing the hope of winning the league for the first time in more than 20 years, it was Sterling, more than Suárez or Sturridge, who kept that ambition alive. Liverpool finished second, Suárez left the club, and Sterling was sent off in a pre-World Cup game in Miami against Ecuador. Yet still Sterling was chosen as England’s most pivotal creative source in Manaus, and though England lost, he was the star of the show. There was — and is — talk of Real Madrid’s coveting him. Why not? He excites in the same way that a previous flamboyant English winger, Laurie Cunningham, did years back. And Cunningham, until he was killed in an auto accident in Spain, did star for Madrid and other clubs. In the coming days, Sterling has two dates with destiny. Liverpool plays at Queens Park Rangers on Sunday and then hosts Real Madrid in the Champions League next Wednesday. Q.P.R. was the first club to recognize Sterling’s talent. He was enrolled in the team’s academy not many years after arriving from his native Jamaica when he was 5. He was a prodigy early on, and by his own account was working toward becoming a professional player by the time he was 8 or 9. Raheem Shaquille Sterling knows he has gifts. When he goes back to Jamaica, he hangs out sometimes with Usain Bolt, and he knows that the world’s fastest man would change places with him at the drop of a hat. O.K., it happens to be another English team, Manchester United, that Bolt imagines playing for in his wildest dreams. But it is the game, more than the fame, that Bolt envies in Sterling. For Bolt, at 28, this will be an unfulfilled wish, aside from occasionally training with United. For Sterling, who turns 20 in December, every dream seems still attainable. Yet sports, and life, is never that simple or predictable. Sterling’s career path has been obvious since he scored precious goals for England at the Under-17 World Cup in Mexico three years ago. He has a child, a daughter, from a brief relationship. He has twice faced charges, though never found guilty, of violence against women. Liverpool takes care of his training and his lifestyle, and he, being ever more determined, takes on extra time in the gym to strengthen his slender upper body. Strengthen, though he is careful to say he does not want to add bulk to a slight frame that may still be growing, one that allows him to sway with extraordinary dexterity out of the way of harmful tackles. The club versus country context is not of his, or Liverpool’s, making. FIFA and UEFA crowd the calendar with ever more games, more demands on the same bodies, more encroachment on the free time of star players. Most of them, from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo on down, do not complain. The game makes them their fortunes, but a career can be short and hangs alarmingly on injuries. Sterling is potentially a heir to their place on the pedestal that millions of kids aspire to be on. Liverpool and England share data from statisticians and sports scientists who can tell them at the flip of a chart whether a player is working too hard. The club and the country — and therefore Sterling — even have the same psychiatrist, who attends training sessions and is available for any player to talk through his doubts and aspirations. Historians can inform Raheem Sterling that he was the  Michael Owen made his debut with Liverpool when he was 17 and with England when he was 18. He is now a TV commentator and regularly talks about how he ignored — to his detriment — warnings about playing too many games too young. Rooney, England’s captain, has come through those risks and is on the verge of his 100th cap. Sterling can hear what they, and the experts, say about growing into his prime. But only he knows what his body tells him.
