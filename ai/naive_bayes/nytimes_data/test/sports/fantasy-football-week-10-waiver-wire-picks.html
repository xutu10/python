Fantasy Football: Week 10 Waiver Wire Picks
Fantasy owners will be without Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski, Alfred Morris, Philip Rivers, Arian Foster, Andrew Luck and T.Y. Hilton this week.
===
So you made it through Week 9 without Aaron Rodgers, Brandon Marshall, Sammy Watkins, Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb, Eddie Lacy and Matt Forte. Congratulations. Your reward: getting through Week 10 without Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski, Alfred Morris, Philip Rivers, Arian Foster, Andrew Luck and T.Y. Hilton. The bye weeks are almost over (I promise), but the good news is that there are plenty of waiver options to help you get through these lean weeks. The normal waiver pickup suggestions are below, but first we have to address the two elephants in the room. Josh Gordon (CLE) —  I’ll repeat that again: Last year’s top-scoring fantasy wide receiver remains unowned in over 40 percent of standard leagues. I’m not sure we can expect him to duplicate his otherworldly numbers from last season, but there is no reason Gordon should be sitting on any waiver wire right now. Adrian Peterson (MIN)  He agreed to a plea deal Tuesday that reduced his felony charge of child abuse to a misdemeanor charge of reckless assault. I hate talking about situations like this in a fantasy context, but regardless of what you think of Peterson’s actions, the N.F.L. may not have the legal authority to keep him off the field. Again, this is speculative, but a consensus top-three pick from three months ago is sitting on waivers in over 70 percent of standard leagues. There is still a chance he may not play this season, but in strictly fantasy terms, the reward highly outweighs the risk. Note: These suggestions are for 10- to 12-team leagues. Every player listed below is owned in fewer than 50 percent of most leagues. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill (MIA) and Robert Griffin III (WAS)  Tannehill is the 10th best fantasy quarterback this season, averaging 18 fantasy points per game since Dolphins Coach Joe Philbin threatened to bench him. Griffin is an injury risk, but there is too much potential to pass up as he comes off a 14-point fantasy game in his first game back from injury. I’d prioritize Tannehill over Griffin since the Redskins are on a bye, but if you’re looking for a down-the-road option, Griffin has a pretty nice fantasy playoff schedule (Rams, Giants, Eagles). Mark Sanchez (PHI)  Filling in for the injured Nick Foles last weekend, Sanchez put up 202 yards with two touchdowns and the inevitable two interceptions. No one ever accused Sanchez of being careful with the football, but it was nice to see the career 55.2 percent passer complete over 70 percent of his passes Sunday. While it is tough to forget his time with the Jets (and we shouldn’t), Sanchez will have a much better offense (and offensive system) around him in Philadelphia and has a nice schedule ahead of him, highlighted by a Week 10 matchup at home against a Panthers defense that is allowing almost 18 fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks. Digging Deeper: Alex Smith (KC), Teddy Bridgewater (MIN), Michael Vick (NYJ), Blake Bortles (JAC). Running Back Terrance West (CLE)  The Browns’ backfield picture is as clear as mud at this point, but we cannot ignore that West, a rookie, outsnapped Ben Tate, 37-30, in Week 9 (while Isaiah Crowell did not even see the field). West did not impress too much in carrying the ball 15 times for 48 yards, but he was able to salvage the day with a 2-yard receiving touchdown (while Tate was stuck running in mud for a total of 3 yards on 10 carries). The Browns will frustratingly go with the hot hand moving forward, but with West available in over 65 percent of leagues, he is worth an add. Alfred Blue (HOU)  Blue filled in for Foster in Week 3 and ran for 78 yards on 13 carries, so he has the talent to put up fantasy points when his number is called. Digging Deeper: Charles Sims (TB), Chris Johnson (NYJ), Lorenzo Taliaferro (BAL), Damian Williams (STL). Wide Receiver Mike Evans (TB)  With Mike Glennon putting up 15 or more fantasy points in four of his past five games and the Falcons (Tampa Bay’s Week 10 opponent) giving up over 23 fantasy points per week (standard scoring) to opposing wide receivers, Evans is as close to a must-start this week as it gets. Martavis Bryant (PIT)  In three N.F.L. games, the rookie has put up an average of 15 fantasy points (standard scoring) per game and has five touchdowns in that span (more than players like Emmanuel Sanders, Julio Jones and Alshon Jeffery have this season). I don’t think we can expect this torrid pace to continue, but Bryant has emerged as Ben Roethlisberger’s second option and should be owned in even the shallowest of leagues at this point. Digging Deeper: Kenny Britt (STL), Allen Hurns (JAC), Markus Wheaton (PIT), Kenny Stills (NO). Tight End No tight ends stand out as strong adds, but a few to consider: Charles Clay (MIA), Coby Fleener (IND), Kyle Rudolph (MIN), Mychal Rivera (OAK), Tyler Eifert (CIN). Defense/Special Teams Atlanta Falcons
