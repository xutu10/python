For Nets’ Deron Williams, Ankle Operations Provide Reason for Optimism
Operations offer a dose of optimism for Nets point guard Deron Williams and his team after the disappointment of last season.

Last September, Deron Williams hobbled down the red carpet of his annual charity dodge ball event with a boot around his right foot. It was an ominous sight that set the tone for yet another frustrating season for Williams,  So if Williams’s easy gait on Monday afternoon is any indication, he and the team have at least one reason to be optimistic entering this season. In May, Williams had a bone chip removed from his right ankle and underwent an arthroscopy to remove spurs from the front and back of his left ankle. Williams laughed and paused for a second when asked if he felt that much of a difference now. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah.” The Nets begin training camp on Sept. 27. Assuming all goes well during the next couple of weeks, it should be the first time in at least two years that Williams will start a season without a worrisome injury issue. “I practiced one time, played nine minutes in a preseason game and was thrown into the fire at 60 or 70 percent,” Williams said of the 2013-14 season. “It’s definitely different this year, and I think it’s great.” Williams has been training the past week and a half at the Nets’ practice facility with most of the team. He said he was mostly playing one-on-one. He and several teammates were at the event Monday, which benefited Point of Hope, a charity focused on raising awareness about autism. Williams, who was awarded a five-year, $98.8 million contract by the Nets in 2012, missed 18 games last season because of various injuries. By most statistical measures, last season was his worst one since his rookie year. Williams, 30, is hoping the operations are the answer to the ankle issues that have plagued him the past couple of seasons. At times last season, he said, simply walking would cause his ankles to swell. “Anytime you can’t walk, you can’t run, you can’t jump, it’s hard to play basketball, especially in this league,” Williams said. “The only thing I wish is that I would’ve gotten surgery earlier.” Lionel Hollins, who is entering his first year as the team’s coach, said of Williams: “For him to get healthy, from the surgical perspective, and to be able to work in the summer and get your mind right and focus on basketball and not focus on pain, that is a tremendous asset to have.” The Nets are entering this season with considerably less hype and expectation than last year, when they had just undergone a huge and expensive makeover. The tone was rather different this week. Williams acknowledged that the team would be “flying under the radar.” But in contrast to last year, he is healthy — and that could be a huge difference.
