Cardinals’ Bruce Arians Took Long Route to Top N.F.L. Job
Bruce Arians became the head coach at Temple in 1983. In 2013, after a circuitous career, he finally got a head coaching position in the N.F.L.

TEMPE, Ariz. —  In 1983, Bruce Arians’s future stretched before him like a desert highway. He was given the keys to Temple’s program at age 30, becoming the youngest head coach in major college football. Ten years earlier, Arians had been riding shotgun with student drivers as part of his Virginia Tech curriculum for the career he had mapped out as a teacher. “I would’ve still been a junior high teacher-coach if I could’ve gotten” a job, Arians said, adding, “I would’ve been a P.E. teacher and tried to do some high school driver’s ed stuff.” But once his internal G.P.S. locked in on football as a career, it seemed nothing could slow Arians’s momentum. In 1986, one of his players, running back Paul Palmer, whom no other Division I coach had recruited out of high school, finished second to Miami quarterback Vinny Testaverde in the Heisman Trophy balloting after carrying Temple to a 6-5 record. It was not clear to Arians that starry night, but he was on the downside of his Temple tenure. In 1988, at the end of a four-win season and a few months after it surfaced that Palmer, by then gone to the N.F.L., had signed with an agent while playing for Temple in violation of N.C.A.A. rules, Arians was dismissed. He did not receive another head coaching offer until January 2013, when he was hired by the  Michael Bidwell, the Cardinals’ owner, said he had been interested in hiring Arians before, as a quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator, but had never been able to get permission to speak with Arians from the teams employing him. The first time they met was at a dinner in Phoenix the night before Arians’s formal interview. Fortified by a couple of Scotches, the introverted Arians enthralled Bidwell with football stories using colorful language. “I really didn’t think I had to put on any airs,” Arians said. Bidwell said: “He probably doesn’t meet Central Casting for that prototypical N.F.L. coach, but that doesn’t matter to our players, it doesn’t matter to our fans. What matters is we’ve got a great football coach.” Coaching as if there is no next stop, Arians’ record with the team is 17-7, including an N.F.L.-best 7-1 this season. The last time the Cardinals had sole possession of the best record in the N.F.L. this late in the year, in 1966, the 62-year-old Arians was a teenager. “I cherish every minute of this because I never expected it,” Arians said. His journey from the youngest coach in major college football to one of the oldest first-time N.F.L. head coaches has taught him “to enjoy the good times while they last,” he said, “because you know hard times are just over the horizon.” The Cardinals will face the visiting St. Louis Rams on Sunday in the first of five divisional games remaining on their 16-game schedule. Arians’s counterpart on the Rams, Jeff Fisher, is six years younger and has been a head coach in the league for 17 years longer. Fisher spent 16 seasons with the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans and has been with the Rams since 2012. The 56-year-old Fisher began his N.F.L. coaching career in Philadelphia in 1986, where he often crossed paths with Arians, whose Owls shared a stadium with the Eagles. Fisher this week was asked if he could imagine persevering through Arians’s long and circuitous route to the N.F.L. “No,” he said. Summing up his journey, Arians said with a laugh, “At 30 I thought I knew everything, and 30 years later I didn’t know anything.” After Temple, Arians joined the Kansas City Chiefs and, aside from stopovers at Mississippi State and Alabama, has remained in the N.F.L. In 2011, Arians figured he had reached the end of the road when he failed to receive a new contract at Pittsburgh after serving five years as the Steelers’ offensive coordinator, during which Pittsburgh reached two Super Bowls and won one. A week into his retirement, Arians was hired by the Colts. Chris Courtney, a retired high school coach who has been close to Arians since college, said, “I think he was O.K. but not O.K. with being done because he knew he could still be successful in the league.” Arians’s ouster from Pittsburgh carried echoes of an earlier, equally painful Pennsylvania exit. Midway through his senior year, Arians was kicked out of York Catholic High, and all the colleges recruiting him in football and baseball fell away except for Virginia Tech. He would not divulge the reasons for his dismissal. His former football coach at the high school, Paul Borsa, said Arians was placed on probation at the end of his junior year for a nonacademic offense and then got caught up with a group of boys for a lesser transgression. But because he was on probation, the die was cast. “Twenty-nine guys were suspended; I was the only one that got expelled,” Arians said. “I didn’t feel like I did anything, but it was a driving force in my life for a long time. “I embarrassed my family,” he said. “It made me want to prove people wrong for a very, very, very long time.” He added, “I’m still trying to prove everybody wrong.” The beauty of being a sexagenarian is that Arians can see a grand design in all the seemingly random moves that shaped his life. “There’s not one moment from my journey that I’d want to change,” he said. “Everything happens for a reason.” At Virginia Tech, he integrated the football dorms by rooming with running back J. B. Barber, who became a good friend. After college, Arians and his wife, Christine, often babysat one or both of Barber’s twins, Ronde and Tiki. On Sunday, Ronde Barber will be in the broadcasting booth working the Cardinals’ game. “I try not to be biased when I’m doing his games,” Barber said, “but you can’t help rooting for him. He’s not afraid. He’s not worried about the repercussions of being an aggressive coach and taking chances.” At Temple, Arians beat Pittsburgh three times and regularly scheduled games against top-10 programs (his 1986 team played the 10th-hardest schedule in the nation). “There was never a time going into those games we didn’t feel we had a chance,” Palmer said. Everywhere he has gone, Arians has instilled confidence in his players, who have rewarded him by playing better than they sometimes believed possible. “He can recognize talent, and he can get the most out of the talent he has,” Palmer said. The Cardinals wear T-shirts that herald Arians’s three tenets: Trust, Loyalty, Respect. The players have become a reflection of their coach: On Sunday they fell behind, 10-0, to the Cowboys on the road before roaring back for a 28-17 victory. The previous week, Arizona was trailing the visiting Philadelphia Eagles by 3 points with less than two minutes to play when, on a third-and-5 from its own 25-yard line, quarterback Carson Palmer threw a 75-yard pass to John Brown to secure the win. “It’s refreshing to have a coach that lets you play to your strengths, lets you be who you are,” said the backup quarterback Drew Stanton, who made three starts early in the season, and went 2-1, when Palmer was out with a shoulder injury. Stanton added: “You look at the typical N.F.L. coach, and he’s not trying to be that. That’s the most refreshing thing about him. I think somebody asked him what you needed to have to be him for Halloween and he said, ‘An attitude and a cocktail.’ There aren’t many coaches who are going to say that in the N.F.L., but that’s who he is.”
