Liverpool benefited from an own goal in the fifth minute of injury time to escape with a 3-2 win at Queens Park Rangers. A madcap finale began in the 67th minute when Q.P.R. defender Richard Dunne put Liverpool ahead by 1-0 with his record-extending 10th own goal in the Premier League. Four goals were scored in a pulsating final eight minutes at Loftus Road — the last by Steven Caulker, who turned the ball into his own net to give Liverpool a fortunate victory. ■ Inter Milan rallied twice for a 2-2 draw against visiting Napoli, and Keisuke Honda scored twice to help A.C. Milan win, 3-1, at Hellas Verona and climb into fourth in Serie A.
