Silent to News Media, Seahawks’ Marshawn Lynch Is Fined Again
Lynch, a running back, violated the N.F.L.'s policy for dealing with the news media. The N.F.L. is also collecting a $50,000 fine that was imposed on Lynch for violations last season.

The N.F.L. fined Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch $50,000 on Wednesday for violations of the league’s news media policy. The league spokesman Michael Signora said penalties against Lynch would total $100,000. Along with the $50,000 for violations of the news media policy this year, the league is collecting a $50,000 fine that was imposed on Lynch for violations last season. The fine from 2013 was postponed in anticipation of future cooperation from Lynch. The league’s policy mandates that players be available during the week and in the locker room after all games. Lynch did not talk to reporters the past two weeks after games against the Giants and Kansas City. Lynch spoke at his locker for nearly 10 minutes Wednesday, but he answered almost every question by talking about music or his shoes. VIKINGS Tate was signed one day after the N.F.L. announced a suspension of Vikings running back Adrian Peterson for the rest of the season for violating the league’s personal conduct policy.

Gruden said that he would try not to “single anybody out” and that “corrections should be in-house.” DOLPHINS LINEBACKER IS OUT  VIDEO ON ABUSE IS SENT OUT The video includes messages from Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll, Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin and others.
