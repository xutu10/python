Icelandic Strongman Does Heavy Lifting on a Second Career as an Actor
Hafthor Julius Bjornsson, an Icelandic strongman best known for lifting cars or tugging trucks or throwing barrels, has parlayed his imposing size into a role on “Game of Thrones.”
===
REYKJAVIK, Iceland — The Mountain is crying and it looks like a thunderstorm, a shaking of colossal shoulders and a soaking of crocodile tears. Hafthor Julius Bjornsson, known to most as Thor and to anyone who watches “Game of Thrones” as the Mountain, is acting, or at least trying to show that he resembles a skilled thespian as much as he does a refrigerator. At 6 feet 9 inches and about 400 pounds, Bjornsson, 25, knows this will always be a stretch. But during his recent audition for the role of a villain in a James Bond film, Bjornsson had to do more than just be the ogre he is on “Game of Thrones.” He had to change emotions quickly, to show he could switch easily from tough to sympathetic, from sinister to stunned. So on a recent afternoon, he agrees to a quick demonstration. Show me happy. Show me sad. Show me tender. Show me I’m-about-to-rip-your-head-off. Bjornsson laughs, particularly when he makes his brief attempt at waterworks, but the lines on his face really do bend into genuine smiles and frowns. He is not, it seems, actually made of steel. Still, he knows his acting skills are far from perfect. As an Icelandic strongman best known for lifting cars or tugging trucks or throwing barrels, Bjornsson had no particular inclination toward movies or TV. He didn’t even reply to the first email he received from a “Game of Thrones” producer because he thought the message was a joke. But when the producers finally reached him and said they were seriously looking for another person to play the role of the Mountain (Bjornsson is the third behemoth to do so), he was intrigued. His role is not heavy with dialogue. Swordplay is important, though, and Bjornsson spent weeks working on the choreography of a sequence that even the most casual fans of the HBO show will remember: Near the end of an epic duel, the Mountain takes a spear to the belly but then, miraculously, recovers and methodically crushes his foe’s face with his bare hands. The crushing is brutal and raw, the sort of act that makes you immediately cover your eyes only to quickly peek through your fingers. Doing the scene “felt strange for me,” Bjornsson, generally a peaceful sort, says. He looks away. “Maybe people don’t think this, but it actually made my heart hurt.” As an actor, though, he quickly realized he needed to be more dispassionate. “I think it went pretty well considering that these things were new to me,” he says after a moment of consideration. “I did not have experience with acting, and I did not have experience with crushing a man’s face with my hands.” The Mountain is groaning and it sounds like an 18-wheeler’s engine belching into gear. Bjornsson is in the back corner of the underground gym in Reykjavik, down the stairs from a dilapidated grocery store, and he is lifting a dumbbell that weighs about 200 pounds over his head. After slowly, agonizingly, heaving it into the air, he holds it, his arm quivering like a flagpole in a squall, before letting his shoulder buckle as the giant weight crashes toward a thick foam pad. Then he picks it up with his other hand and does it again. The foam pad cries out for mercy. The assembled gym rats cry out for more. Bjornsson does not break focus. Over the course of about 90 minutes, he goes through a workout that would tire an elephant. He alternates sets with a tractor of a man named Bruno, an attendant at a local mental hospital, while a few regulars ogle the pair’s output. This is actually a light day: Bjornsson casually lifts 265 pounds straight over his head. He muscles up something that resembles a metal tree trunk weighing about 285 pounds. He does bent-over abdominal crunches while tugging on a pulley connected to a weight machine. “How much was that?” someone asks. Bjornsson shrugs. “The whole stack,” he says. About five years ago, Bjornsson became a professional, competing in events like the World’s Strongest Man. A year ago, he made his debut on “Game of Thrones” and became an overnight star. It is a life of constant motion, and he recently finished shooting the next season of the show in Croatia. While staying in Dubrovnik, he imported his own oatmeal because, he said, it was impossible to find his favorite breakfast food. Eating has generally been the most difficult adjustment. To keep his weight up, Bjornsson generally eats every two hours, often consuming 10,000 calories in a day. He enjoys spinach — which he often eats raw — as well as chicken, beef, salmon and sweet potatoes. Then there is the matter of his weight-lifting routine. Most hotel workout rooms do not have enough weight available to challenge Bjornsson, and although he occasionally finds decent health clubs on the road, it is rare to find a facility that can handle a man whose arms are so large that he once fell asleep while having a tattoo sleeve inked. That is why, whenever he can, Bjornsson returns to this basement gym in Reykjavik, to the barren space that an observer describes as “sort of like a Brazilian prison.” The gym’s name, Jakabol, is perfect for Bjornsson: Roughly translated, it means Nest of Giants. “It is simple here,” he says, and by that he means that its authenticity helps him remember his most basic truth: Before he was on television lifting stones or flipping logs or even executing men with his palms, he was the same as every growing boy in Iceland. “For boys here, it is not complicated,” he says. “We all just want to be strong.” The Mountain is bathing and it looks like a tidal wave, like a wall of water fleeing its basin in fear. Bjornsson is in the spa at Laugar, a more upscale fitness center that is, geographically and symbolically, on the other side of town from Jakabol. Laugar has massage tables and saunas and pools; Jakabol has sopping-wet weight belts and, possibly, black mold. Still, Bjornsson says both places are important to maintaining his massive frame. On this afternoon he is recovering from his lifting by spending several minutes in a steaming whirlpool — complete with soft candles and Muzak playing in the background — before plunging himself into a cold tub that resembles a barrel. He does this multiple times. Each time, his submersion comes with a fire-hose gush of displaced water that floods the hallway. Once, the torrent soaks a maintenance man walking by with an overmatched mop. Bjornsson has always been big. After completing his hot-cold therapy, he sits, dripping wet, in a refreshment area and sips lemon-flavored water while reminiscing about when he thought he might someday play in the N.B.A. A center, he played for three years on Iceland’s national team before injuries ended his career at 20. He then found his way to Jakabol and to competitive weight lifting. In his first strongman competition, he shattered a long-held record in an event that essentially measures the distance a competitor can walk while carrying a boulder. Success came quickly. He has won numerous Icelandic and continental competitions and finished second at this year’s World’s Strongest Man, losing by a half-point to a Lithuanian. That loss eats at Bjornsson because strength is currency in Iceland. Children hear the saga of Grettir the Strong, a tale believed to date to around the 14th century that describes a famous Icelandic outlaw who does some good (he kills a notorious ghost) but also wreaks havoc through violence. Gudmundur Saemundsson, a lecturer in sports and culture at the University of Iceland, says that “the thing about Grettir is that he does not know his own strength.” Bjornsson, on the other hand, does, and this is part of the allure. While some Icelandic boys gravitate to team sports like soccer or handball, many find their way to weight lifting as a way to quantify just how strong they are. (Arm-wrestling is also a popular pastime.) Gunnar Nelson, an up-and-coming mixed martial arts fighter from Iceland, says that he, too, grew up aware of his homeland’s cultural attention to strength, particularly when Jon Pall Sigmarsson, a telegenic strongman, shot to global stardom after winning the World’s Strongest Man competition four times between 1984 and 1990. Nelson dabbled in weight lifting before shifting to fighting, but he remains fascinated by the strongmen. “Those guys, they’re extremists,” Nelson says. “They’re filthy. If we were in cave man days and I had a pack, I’d want Hafthor in it. He could move some big rocks around for sure.” The Mountain is hugging and it feels like an overcoat, like tree trunks bending down to offer a warm embrace. Bjornsson is remembering old stories with his father and his grandfather, standing on a balcony and waiting for dinner as the sun sinks into the ocean. Bjornsson’s size is, at least in part, genetic. His grandfather, Reynir Asgeirsson, is nearly as tall as Bjornsson and just as broad across the chest. Bjornsson’s father, Bjorn Thor Reynisson, is over 6 feet tall, and his mother, Ragnheidur Margret Juliusdottir, is not much shorter. “He was always big, even when he wasn’t tall,” Asgiersson says, gleefully telling stories of a teenage Bjornsson’s days working on the family farm a few hours outside Reykjavik. The food is served. Bjornsson sits at the head of the table and dutifully passes the serving dishes around before helping himself to a heaping plate of succulent Icelandic veal, potatoes and vegetables. He goes light on the gravy but does not hesitate to have thirds. He does not drink wine, choosing instead a second piece of cheesecake. Sitting in the living room after dinner, Bjornsson leans back in an easy chair and unrolls his left arm, rubbing over the stretch marks on his biceps. He lives nearby and tries to eat with his family once or twice a week when he is home. When he travels, his mother usually packs him a lunchbox for the plane so that he can be sure to have salmon and vegetables while on the go. Over the next few weeks, Bjornsson will make appearances at conventions in London and Bahrain. He will sign autographs and post pictures on his Instagram account of him trying to squeeze into an airplane bathroom. He will answer constant questions about what will happen to his character in the coming “Game of Thrones” season. He will also learn that the role in the Bond film was given to a different giant, a former professional wrestler. Initially, this disappoints him, but he quickly finds a silver lining. The film role most likely would have conflicted with next year’s World’s Strongest Man competition, forcing Bjornsson to make a difficult choice between his new fascination and his natural path. Now, there will be no distractions. Yes, the Mountain wants to be an actor. But he also wants what every boy on this island does. To be even bigger.
