California Chrome to Race on Turf
Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner California Chrome will try turf racing for the first time in the Grade 1 Hollywood Derby on Saturday at Del Mar.
===
Kentucky Derby The 3-year-old colt will face five rivals in 1 1/8-mile race. Trainer Art Sherman had nominated California Chrome for both the Native Diver Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on the artificial Polytrack surface and the Hollywood Derby. But state racing rules allow only one race to be entered, and Sherman chose the turf race. Sherman said that by having California Chrome try the turf it will give the horse more options when he runs next year as a 4-year-old. California Chrome worked a half-mile on the Jimmy Durante turf course last Sunday. He will gallop on it Thursday. Regular rider Victor Espinoza will be aboard Saturday. The other entries for the $300,000 race are Cabral, Flamboyant, Lexie Lou, Sawyer’s Hill and Talco.
