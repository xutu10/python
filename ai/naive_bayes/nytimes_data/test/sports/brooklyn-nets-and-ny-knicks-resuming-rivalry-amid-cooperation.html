Nets and Knicks Resuming Rivalry Amid Cooperation
The Knicks visit the Nets on Friday for their first face-off of a season in which they will serve as joint hosts of the N.B.A. All-Star Game.

The intracity turf war between the  As  “We’ll see what comes out of tomorrow night’s game,” said Silver, who accompanied the Nets on Thursday to City Harvest, a food bank in Queens, where the league was promoting its Commitment to Service initiative. “Maybe there won’t be such positive feelings after the game. But at least so far, everyone’s feeling very good.” Since the start of the 2012-13 season, when the Nets moved to Brooklyn from New Jersey, the clubs have been engaged in a crosstown marketing battle. The organizations have exchanged jabs through billboards, television commercials and interviews. The Knicks have won five of the eight head-to-head matchups since the Nets moved to Brooklyn. “We recognize both organizations are incredibly competitive, and they’re competing against each other not just on the court, but they’re competing for sponsors and season-ticket sales and everything else,” Silver said. “But they also recognize they’re both part of something larger: That’s the N.B.A.” Neither team started the season with big expectations from the outside. The Nets are 2-2 under their new coach, Lionel Hollins. The Knicks are 2-3 as they try to establish an identity under their new president, Phil Jackson, and new coach, Derek Fisher, who has installed the triangle offense. Silver was not asked to make a prediction. But his scouting report could give Nets fans some hope. “I watched the Knicks game last night; clearly they’re still learning the triangle,” Silver said, laughing. “I still don’t understand it. But they’re learning it.” The All-Star Game will take place Feb. 15 at Madison Square Garden. The festivities the night before, including the Slam Dunk Contest, will take place at Barclays Center. The Nets last beat the Knicks at Barclays Center on Nov. 26, 2012. In past games in Brooklyn, Knicks fans have been a vocal presence. Even as the verbal volleys between the organizations have felt contrived at times, the atmosphere at the games has usually been noticeably elevated. “The energy will be high,” Nets center Brook Lopez said. “I’m sure everyone will be up for the game, and it will be fun to go out and beat them.” Guard Jarrett Jack, who is new to the Nets this season, has been exchanging light banter since the summer with his friend Iman Shumpert, a Knicks guard. Jack said he was looking forward to his first experience in the environment. “It’s going to be like high school — that school you’re going to play that’s around the corner or up the street,” Jack said, adding, “It just breeds good competition.”
