With His Words and Deeds, Derek Jeter Never Left the Base Paths
In 20 years of living onstage in New York City, Jeter was never caught in a compromising position and played his best defense in front of his locker.

Remember when  O.K., but remember when Jeter went to a Manhattan diner to top off a three-tequila night with an omelet and some waffles, only to be sucker-punched by some wannabe tough guy? Wait: That was another teammate, David Wells. Well, then, remember when Jeter was spotted at a swingers club in Dallas? Yeah, Jeet! Hold on: That was Rodriguez, again. O.K., O.K. But remember all the times over his long career when a frustrated Jeter kicked a Gatorade jug (a sponsor!), slammed his bat against a dugout wall and had to be restrained from going after an opponent? All the times when he was ejected? Wait: None of that happened. Ever. The Jeter worship service that is this baseball season will end for its deity Sunday at Fenway Park. But before Jeter is assumed into the baseball heavens, to be greeted at the Players Entrance by the Yankee Clipper, the Mick and the Sultan of Swat — “Hiya, kid!” — let us consider what might be the man’s greatest statistic: In 20 years of living onstage in New York City, the so-called media capital of the world, Derek Jeter has never played ball. He has never been caught in a compromising position. He has never embarrassed himself. After a long shift at the ballpark, he has never been known to ooze into one of those establishments that tabloids call jiggle joints, or to stumble out of some meatpacking-district hot spot after too much Veuve Clicquot. This isn’t to say that Jeter hasn’t gone out at night, or that he hasn’t been photographed holding a beer, or that he didn’t glower once at Rodriguez after a botched infield pop-up. But he will retire with his honor and privacy intact, leaving the world to know only that he was raised right by his parents, has dated models and movie stars, and, most revealingly, kept telling himself not to cry as he played his final game at Yankee Stadium on Thursday night. Jeter’s ability to maintain a posture of sustained inscrutability — or, if you must, dignified comportment — has extended especially to the spoken word. That he is no Ozzie Smith at shortstop is well established; statistically speaking, he’s not even a Gene Michael. But aside from a few notable exceptions (throwing out Jeremy Giambi at home with that mind-boggling flip in the 2001 playoffs), he has played his best defense in front of his locker: catching every controversial question thrown to him and tossing it aside as if it were a scuffed ball unsuitable for play. In a major league career that dates to the Clinton administration’s first term — he is the only Yankees shortstop a generation of fans has known — inquiring reporters have gathered around Jeter in the clubhouse thousands of times. He has maintained eye contact, answered nearly every question posed to him — and said nothing. This is not a complaint, but rather an expression of awe; of admiration, even. His batting average and fielding percentage aside, this kid from Kalamazoo, Mich., entered the New York meat grinder two decades ago and came out the other end looking as sharp as Joe DiMaggio’s suit. Diverting resources that might have been dedicated to crises greater than a ballplayer’s retirement, The New York Times recently conducted an analysis of thousands of Jeter quotations it had recorded since his first major league game. That was on May 29, 1995, when a reporter observed that he had handled an 0-for-5 performance with a veteran’s aplomb. “Veteran?” Jeter said. “I’ve got to get a hit first.” He was all of 20 but was already locked in — focused on saying nothing that might be contorted into a next-day story line: “Rookie Remains Cocky Despite His Zip of a Day.” The analysis suggests that Jeter does not rely on baseball clichés, the “We’ll get ’em tomorrow, one game at a time” waste of oxygen that can cause sportswriters to daydream of baseball-free winters. But he does have pet phrases, like “swinging the bat.” “Tex has been swinging the bat a lot better.” “We’ve been swinging the bats collectively. Guys are having good at-bats, hitting balls hard, finding holes.” “I’m not swinging the bat very well. It’s obvious.” Jeter also often uses “bottom line” (“We need to swing the bats better; that’s the bottom line”) and “doesn’t make a difference” (“It doesn’t make a difference if guys are out of the lineup. We could have brought back Gehrig, Ruth and DiMaggio. We just need to swing the bats better”). More interesting, though, is how often he has deflected or deflated an emerging narrative, whether provocative or benign, with certain go-to phrases. “Doesn’t mean” is one. In early June 2007, for example, the Yankees were several games under .500 but had managed to win three of their last four, prompting gaseous talk about momentum as they headed to Chicago. They lost, 6-4, in the first game, though, as Jeter made the final out with a man on first. The postgame questions may not have asked him about his plans for October, but there was this uh-oh feel to it all, reflected in The Times’s  Jeter sounded like an adult lecturing children about perspective: “Just because we lost doesn’t mean there was a letdown.” In early 2012, the story line was that Jeter, at 37, might be showing his age — a notion that made him bristle (if one can bristle politely). After a four-hit game in late April, he said, “Everyone is getting older, but just because you’ve gotten older doesn’t mean you can’t do things.” A couple of months later, he turned 38 — and he went on to bat .316 and lead the American League in hits. Another popular tool of redirection is “no big deal.” In August 2005, Jeter had an ice pack around his bruised right thumb after a game: “It’s really no big deal.” In June 2006, he strained his right hand, left a game early and went 0 for 5 the next day: “It’s no big deal.” But in September 2012, when he left a game after landing awkwardly on first base, Jeter changed it up: “I just jammed my ankle. It’s not a big deal.” I’d be lying if. I can’t worry about. My job is to. This is largely how Jeter has managed to avoid the tag of controversy, all in an environment in which a misplaced adverb might spark a tabloid conflagration. He has not been tightly wound so much as in complete control, always, demonstrating extreme emotion with little more than a pumped fist. His way of expressing displeasure over a called strike, for example, has been to bow his head and talk as if to home plate, so as not to show up the umpire. But this is New York City. And Jeter plays for the New York Yankees franchise, in which every crotch tug and spit spray is analyzed for its impact on the pinstripe kingdom. What’s more, Jeter played most of his career for George Steinbrenner, the longtime Yankees owner who was so complicated that writers had run out of applicable adjectives by 1980. For several years, Jeter avoided the wrath from Olympus. But in early 2003, Steinbrenner publicly suggested that Jeter’s bachelor lifestyle had affected his performance during the 2002 season, when the Yankees failed to reach the World Series for the first time in five years. (Cleveland Indians fans howl at the thought.) Among the many cherished Yankee traditions was one in which players and managers countered Steinbrenner’s tirades with rants of their own. But Jeter’s response somehow managed to convey both anger and respect. “He’s the boss and he’s entitled to his opinion, right or wrong, but what he said has been turned into me being this big party animal,” Jeter told The Associated Press. “He even made a reference to one birthday party. That’s been turned into that I’m like Dennis Rodman now. I don’t think that’s fair. I have no problems with people criticizing how I play. But it bothers me when people question my work ethic.” How did the two men resolve their differences? By appearing together in a  Jeter has occasionally been criticized for petulance over these many years, but they hinge on moments when, characteristically, he has not said enough. In 2007, in the mix of his hot-and-cold relationship with Rodriguez — who, some say, should have been the one playing shortstop — Jeter dismissed suggestions that as the team’s captain, he should encourage fans to show more support for Rodriguez. “It’s not my job to change the way fans act,” he said, adding: “Why would you even get caught up in that? It’s not your job to tell fans what to do, bottom line.” Bottom line. There’s that catchphrase again. If nothing else, these scattered moments of churlishness confirm that if pricked, Jeter does bleed, which became evident during contract negotiations four years ago. Although the Yankees have cashed in handsomely on this yearlong Jeterfest, back then they publicly invited their aging shortstop to test the market before reaching a three-year deal with the clearly wounded Jeter, who thought his desire to end his career in New York was well known. “To hear the organization tell me to go shop it when I just told you I wasn’t going to — if I’m going to be honest with you, I was angry about it,” he said. That was that, and another season began. These bittersweet final days of Jeter’s baseball career at times have been — what’s the word? — absurd. Absurd in the overboard and lucrative adulation, yes, but also in the snarky backlash that the worship has engendered against a superior ballplayer who stuck with one team and always played his hardest. The most genuine moment came Thursday night, after Jeter played his final game at Yankee Stadium, which he won with a game-ending hit. No unnecessary speeches. No awkward presentation of gaudy and useless gifts. Just Jeter, partly revealed. During the game, he was so emotional that he had to compose himself in the clubhouse, and so nervous in the field that he prayed the ball would not come to him. But now that it was over, he thanked the fans. Thanked the Yankees. Wished the team he had just beaten, the Baltimore Orioles, the best of luck in a postseason that will not include him. Took a final walk around the infield, waved his cap once more and was gone. The deification of Derek Jeter will soon abate, to be resurrected when he is inducted five years from now into the communion of saints, the Baseball Hall of Fame. His bronze plaque will list the more than 3,460 hits, the .309 career batting average, the five World Series championships, on and on. And above these statistics will appear the face of dignity intact, under a Yankees cap. Bottom line.
