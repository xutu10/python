James Shields Leads Royals Into M.L.B. Playoffs
Over the last two years, perhaps no one player has done more than James Shields to change the culture and the mind-set in Kansas City.

The day after the  Eiland told Shields how he had made the pitchers’ routine more structured, stressing minor details like when to stretch and the importance of being on time. He warned them about fraternizing too long with players on other teams. He wanted them to support one another, even during the most ordinary drills. He instructed them to throw inside, attack the zone, be unafraid — better yet, be intimidating. “That’s who I am anyway,” Shields responded. Over the last two years, perhaps no one player has done more than Shields to change the culture and the mind-set in Kansas City. His arrival brought the Royals not just a bona fide ace, but also a leader that the still-emerging young squad could learn from and rally around. Since Shields arrived, the Royals have had their first consecutive winning seasons since 1993 and 1994, and this year they made the playoffs for the first time since 1985. Now their season has come down to a one-game wild-card playoff on Tuesday against the Oakland Athletics at Kauffman Stadium. It is the Royals’ biggest game in decades, and the 32-year-old Shields is starting. When Shields was in the Tampa Bay Rays’ minor league system, a teammate who was a fan of the basketball player James Worthy started calling him “Big Game James.” The tag followed him to the majors as he gained a reputation for pitching well under pressure. “I wear that nickname with pride,” Shields said. In 2008, he helped lead the Rays to the playoffs for the first time in franchise history and then to the World Series. They lost to the Philadelphia Phillies, four games to one, and Shields started the Rays’ only win. He held the Phillies scoreless over five and two-thirds innings in Game 2 to even the series, but he did not get another start. Joe Maddon, the Rays’ manager during all seven of Shields’s seasons with the team, recalled how the pitcher used to challenge himself. In 2010, for instance, Shields felt that Maddon was removing him from games too early. Maddon had determined that once Shields reached 105 to 110 pitches, he was not as effective. So the next year, Shields made a goal to finish games. And he did. In 2011, he threw 11 complete games, the most anyone in the majors had thrown since 1999. “He’s somewhat of a perfectionist; he wants to be counted on,” Maddon said in a telephone interview recently. “He’s not opposed to creating some of his own angst because I think he believes that it brings out the best in him. When you play a big game, in a big moment, and you’re facing better hitters, you like to have him there.” Referring to the Royals, Maddon said: “They’re fortunate to have him. He embraces the moment, looks forward to the moment, doesn’t cower from the moment. He’s the kind of guy that distributes courage among the rest, just by being who he is.” Royals General Manager Dayton Moore recognized those qualities and targeted Shields. Moore, who was hired in 2006, was developing and acquiring young talent that would become the team’s core: Alex Gordon, Danny Duffy, Salvador Perez, Eric Hosmer and Greg Holland. But Moore needed a pitching ace. Because of the franchise’s financial limitations, he said, the Royals were never likely to attract a top-line starter in free agency. They couldn’t rely on a young player to fill that role, either. The only route was to make a trade. So Moore sent his top prospect, outfielder Wil Myers, to the Rays to acquire Shields in a blockbuster deal. Both teams emerged winners. Myers won the American League Rookie of the Year award the next season and is now a rising star. Shields might mean even more to the Royals. Over the last two years, he has been a model of consistency, throwing more than 450 innings while compiling a 3.18 earned run average. The Royals have won 42 of his 68 starts, accounting for almost one-fourth of their victories in that span. Shields can energize the entire team, as evidenced by the occasional tribal scream he lets out when he leaves the mound. Even when he isn’t starting, Shields is a fixture on the top step of the dugout, cheering, and he’s often the team’s spokesman in the media. He also pokes fun at everyone to keep the mood in the clubhouse light and loose. “It’s night and day from what it was,” Duffy said. Shields clearly commands his teammates’ respect. When Eiland needs to send a message, or when the Royals police themselves, Shields is often the messenger. He has the authority to deliver harsh critiques. When the veteran Raul Ibanez wanted to host a team meeting around the All-Star break — after which the Royals won 41 of their final 64 games — he approached Shields first for his approval. When the Royals called up Brandon Finnegan, a pitcher who the team picked in the first round of the 2014 draft, they put his locker next to Shields’s. And Shields made sure Finnegan knew the unwritten rules of being a rookie: Do what the veterans tell you and don’t complain. Duffy, the Royals’ 25-year-old starter, watched Shields work all season and had a breakout year, posting a 2.53 E.R.A. He said Shields acted like his “big brother.” Shields sometimes tells stories from his 2008 World Series run with the Rays. This Royals team reminds him of those Rays, he said. They’re both plucky, small-market teams that overcame reputations as losers, and they’re both built around a core of young players that matured together. After the season, Shields will become a free agent and will surely be among the most sought-after players on the market. The Red Sox and the Yankees could pursue him aggressively, perhaps starting a bidding war. The Royals probably won’t be able to afford him, but Moore understood that all along. “It’s all worth it regardless of what happens,” he said last week.
