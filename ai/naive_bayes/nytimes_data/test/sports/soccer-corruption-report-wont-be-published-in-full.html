Soccer Corruption Report Won’t Be Published in Full
Hans-Joachim Eckert of FIFA’s ethics committee cited legal reasons for not releasing all of an inquiry into the awarding of two World Cup sites.

Over the past few months, FIFA has received widespread criticism for its reluctance to release a report on an investigation into the potential corruption of the bidding process that led to the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar. On Friday, FIFA responded — sort of — on its own  Hans-Joachim Eckert, chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA’s ethics committee, said he had received the report on the investigation, which was led by Michael J. Garcia, a former federal prosecutor in the United States, and was now preparing a statement on its contents. Publishing the report in full, Eckert said, would not be feasible because it would put FIFA in a “very difficult situation legally.” He did not elaborate. Garcia, along with some members of FIFA’s powerful executive committee, including Sunil Gulati, president of U.S. Soccer,  Sepp Blatter, FIFA’s longtime president, has generally ignored such calls. In a recent meeting of the executive committee, Blatter tried to differentiate between members who were involved in the voting for the two bids in 2010 and those who were not. Those members who weren’t, like Gulati and others asking for transparency, should not be able to vote on whether the report is published, Blatter said. As it stands now, it seems unlikely that the report will be published in anything close to its entirety. On FIFA’s website, Eckert said his “statement” on the report would include “an overview of the investigation report, a summary of the main findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report, as well as a brief evaluation of the same.” He expects to issue this statement by mid-November, he said. The potential publication of the report has been a recurrent talking point in world soccer. Earlier this week, Garcia spoke out again, calling FIFA’s unwillingness to open itself up to public examination bizarre, given its status as an agency of sport. “The investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard,” Garcia said at a lawyers event in London. “That’s a kind of system which might be appropriate for an intelligence agency, but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution that serves the public and is the subject of intense public scrutiny.” Blatter, who will seek his fifth four-year term as president next spring, has shown no inclination toward altering the organization’s stance on transparency. On Friday, Michel Platini, head of the European soccer federation, who at one point considered challenging Blatter for FIFA’s presidency, told the French sports daily L'Équipe that he believed that Blatter was no longer serving the greater good of FIFA. “Sepp is not the president of FIFA anymore — he is FIFA,” Platini said. “One must not use football, but serve football.”
