Tyler Varga of Yale Blasts Off to an Unstoppable Start
Tyler Varga has appeared, at times, to be unstoppable, and he attributes part of what makes him special to his sometimes odd diet and workout habits.

NEW HAVEN —  A caption-less photo ran in the sports section of Monday’s edition of the  None could immediately place it. Few would blame them. It happened quickly, and maybe to those unfamiliar with football — or physics — it would not be so remarkable. But Conn knew: Not every day does a 5-foot-11, 225-pound running back outrace everybody for 60 yards, twist his torso 180 degrees around midstride and deliver a forceful right elbow to a defender, flinging him off his feet, while never losing balance to score his fifth touchdown run of the game. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” said the author and Yale football historian Rich Marazzi. There have been more than a few similar comments about Tyler Varga’s play for the 4-1 Bulldogs, who host 1-4 Penn on Saturday. He has appeared, at times, to be unstoppable — a running back built like a nuclear warhead, with a bodybuilder’s physique (thanks to his parents) and a gymnast’s sense of balance (thanks to his childhood). Varga has rushed for 12 touchdowns, which is more than all but four players in the Football Bowl Subdivision and the Football Championship Subdivision combined. His 141.8 rushing yards per game are the most in the Ivy League by 52. In only 19 career games, he is seventh in Yale history with 2,082 yards. That has Varga, an Ontario native, being compared to some of Yale’s most hallowed runners — Calvin Hill, Dick Jauron and Rich Diana — halfway through his senior season. “I wish I had him,” said Carmen Cozza, who coached Yale from 1965 until 1996. “I wouldn’t classify him, because it’s too hard to compare between the ’60s and now. But I wish I had him.” Walking through campus this week toward his neo-gothic dormitory on Wall Street, Varga detailed what he believed set him apart from other backs in a league that — like most of football — has lately revolved around the passing game. It stems from a meticulous diet and workout habits that have his teammates looking sideways at him as if he has lost his mind. “I don’t know if there’s anybody else in the Ivy League that’s as extreme,” Varga said. “It’s not something that I do to please others or make myself proud. I do it to make myself better.” To wit, there is Varga lifting weights in the recreational gym after the team lifted in the varsity gym. His wake-up-every-two-hours-to-eat meal plan. The Tupperware containers of plain rice and egg whites he brings to classes. “He often jokes about his diet,” Varga’s father, John, wrote in an email, “saying that he stopped eating for taste a long time ago.” The discipline and self-regard stem from his parents, who were national-level competitive bodybuilders. In Kitchener, Ontario, about an hour west of Toronto, Varga was raised to understand how to supplement his athletic endeavors, be they gymnastics, judo, ski racing, baseball or, eventually, football. But Varga still had difficulty getting noticed by American colleges, while Canadian universities flooded his home with offers. Baylor and Duke showed interest, but a torn peroneal tendon — which connects the calf muscle to the foot — during his final high school game scared away most programs, especially when compartment syndrome restricted blood flow, and doctors grew concerned that the foot would become gangrenous. One undeterred coach was Tony Reno, who was in charge of special teams at Harvard at the time. When Reno was hired as the Yale head coach in January 2012, he said, a whiteboard in his office contained the names of all the prospects the previous staff had been looking at. Reno erased every name but one. Varga had just finished his freshman year at the University of Western Ontario, fully recovered from the foot injury, and had been named the league’s rookie of the year. He was looking to transfer to the Ivy League, where he could study pre-med, so he sent Reno an email of congratulations. Reno called right away. “We knew what talent he had,” Reno said. “We’re very fortunate that it worked out.” His first fall, Varga led the nation with 194.2 all-purpose yards per game while playing running back and option quarterback, as well as returning kicks for an injury-riddled Yale team that finished 2-8. He looked so impressive that an anonymous phone call to the N.C.A.A. before the Dartmouth game questioned Varga’s instant eligibility as a transfer from Canada. After nearly two weeks of deliberation — Varga sat out the game, a 34-14 loss — the N.C.A.A. cleared him to play the rest of the season. But there was little precedent for his instant success on a different field size, with different rules, in a different country. Yale was initially unsure whether to list him as a sophomore or a freshman. But Varga clearly did not have much difficulty making the transition. “The length of the field doesn’t really matter anyway,” Varga said. “You’re just trying to run to the end zone.” For Reno, Varga has been the perfect specimen to illustrate the benefits of Reno’s new focus on nutrition and body maintenance, although he chuckles about the Tupperware. And the photo? That’s just Tyler, Reno said. “If you give him a crease and he doesn’t have to hit anybody, he’ll go through it,” Reno said. “But sometimes he takes the road less traveled.”
