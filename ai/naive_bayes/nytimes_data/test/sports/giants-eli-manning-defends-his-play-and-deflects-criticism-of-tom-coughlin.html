Giants’ Eli Manning Defends His Play and Deflects Criticism of Tom Coughlin
Manning, coming off a game in which he threw five interceptions, said he could “still play at an extremely high level” and wanted to be a Giant for the rest of his career.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —   “I can still play at an extremely high level and take over games,” Manning said Wednesday when asked if he believed he had several good seasons left. “I can still make plays, and I still feel energized. I can still make all the throws.” Manning has one year remaining on his contract at a salary of $17 million, which has prompted discussion about his future with the team. Manning conceded that anything could happen. “I saw it with my own brother,” he said. “I never thought Peyton would play for another franchise. I don’t think he did either. You see how things play out.” But he added: “There’s only one franchise I’ve been a part of, and it’s the best one. I don’t want anything other than to be here and win another championship here. I don’t worry about my contract. “I’ve got to play better, and hopefully everything else will take care of itself.” Manning said he planned to play several more seasons. “I love what I’m doing,” he said. “Sometimes it’s tough, but I still have the best job in the world. You go through tough times, and we’re going through one of those times right now. “But you find ways out of that. I just have to play better. But until you’re hurt or feel you can’t help the team — and I don’t know when that point comes — I will want to play.” Manning was also asked about the former Giants running back Tiki Barber, who is a radio commentator and said this week that he thought Coach  “Yeah, saw that — very nice of him,” Manning said with a sardonic smile. “Good to hear from ol’ Tiki.” Manning said he was not surprised. “Everybody has their opinions,” he said. When asked if it was distracting when a former player called for a coach to be fired, Manning responded, “I think it depends on your opinion of that player.” SCHWARTZ SET FOR COWBOYS  Schwartz was signed to play left guard. The rookie Weston Richburg has replaced him in the Giants’ first 10 games. But with the starting right tackle Justin Pugh hampered this week because of a strained quadriceps and not practicing, Schwartz could slide into Pugh’s spot. Coach Tom Coughlin would not say where Schwartz would play, but he indicated that Schwartz might play the entire game. Schwartz, who has played guard and tackle in his career, said after Wednesday’s practice that he had spent the workout moving from position to position.  “I think I can play anywhere and feel O.K.,” he said. “Eventually we’ll narrow it down for me, but I’ll be fine.” It will be Schwartz’s first game in the Giants-Cowboys rivalry. “I grew up a 49ers fan,” said Schwartz, who was reared in California. “Liking the Cowboys was never something I did.” INJURY UPDATE “He may get cleared to do some things tomorrow,” Coach Tom Coughlin said of Williams, the team’s leading tackler. “We will see how he does step by step.” Defensive tackle Cullen Jenkins, who has a calf strain, also did not practice.
