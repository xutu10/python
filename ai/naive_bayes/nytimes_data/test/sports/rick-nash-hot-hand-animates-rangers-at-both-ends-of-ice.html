Rick Nash’s Hot Hand Animates the Rangers at Both Ends of the Ice
After being frustrated in last season’s playoffs, Nash is now carrying the Rangers and is on track for his first 50-goal season.

GREENBURGH, N.Y. —  Rick Nash is on such a roll this season that his teammates are employing seer-like abilities. After Nash reached the 20-goal mark for the 11th straight season with a two-goal performance against the Calgary Flames on Tuesday, it was Chris Kreider’s turn at the crystal ball. “When he gets motoring on a breakaway, we just say, ‘Here comes another one.’ We know he’s going to score,” said Kreider, who also scored in  Nash scored  With points in 24 of the Rangers’ 29 games, Nash, 30, has been carrying the team in a way he has not since he arrived in a trade from the Columbus Blue Jackets in July 2012. The Rangers have endured injuries and battled inconsistent play, but Nash’s quiet but fierce competitiveness and his two-way contributions are admired and appreciated. “He’s dominating for sure, not a shock for us because he scores 20 goals every year,” said his frequent linemate Mats Zuccarello, who led the Rangers in overall scoring last season with 59 points. “This year the puck is really finding him.” The Rangers need Nash to continue his hot streak as they head toward the second half of the season in a tight race in the Metropolitan Division. The first overall pick by Columbus in the 2002 draft, Nash worked tirelessly during last spring’s run to the Stanley Cup finals, but the offensive bounces did not go his way. He scored only three goals on 83 shots in 25 playoff games — all against Montreal in the Eastern Conference finals. Since becoming the Rangers’ coach last season, Alain Vigneault has been an unabashed Nash supporter. He sympathized with his star during the weeks of playoff frustration. Now the coach is visibly pleased to see Nash flourish. “We need our best players to be our best, and Rick is obviously doing that right now,” Vigneault said. “Last year, as far as producing, his numbers weren’t where they needed to be. Right now he’s finding ways to put the puck in the net. He’s a positive example for the rest of our group.” Goaltender Henrik Lundqvist has observed Nash from his crease, and he emphasized that Nash’s defensive play was also valuable. Nash has become an important part of the Rangers’ penalty-killing unit. “He does a lot at both ends of the ice and that means a lot,” Lundqvist said. “We all notice the effort Rick brings every night.” The mild-mannered Nash seemed to take time to adjust to the quicker pace of life in Manhattan. He had 21 goals in 44 games of the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season, then just one in 12 playoff games. Last year he scored 26 goals in the regular season, during which he missed 17 games with concussion symptoms. But this season, when he has also become a father for the first time, Nash is on pace to eclipse the 50-goal mark, another career first. He had a career-high 41 goals for the Blue Jackets in 2003-04 and 40 goals in 2008-09. Entering Friday’s games, he was tied for second in the N.H.L. in goals, three behind Tyler Seguin of the Dallas Stars. In what could prove to be the best of his 12 N.H.L. seasons, Nash has a rooting section on the Rangers’ bench every time he touches the puck. “It’s awesome to have a guy producing like that for us,” Zuccarello said. “It’s great to see. It’s a product of his hard work.” SLAP SHOTS The Rangers on Friday signed the backup goaltender Cam Talbot to a one-year contract extension. ... Center Derick Brassard, who missed the last two games because of mumps, skated with the team Friday and could play this weekend.
