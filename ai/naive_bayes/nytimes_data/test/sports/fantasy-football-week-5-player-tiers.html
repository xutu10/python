Fantasy Football: Week 5 Player Tiers
Andrew Luck joins Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees in Tier 1 this week.
===
In this statistical model, I apply a clustering algorithm called  Quarterback Andrew Luck joins Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees in Tier 1 this week. Nick Foles had a poor fantasy stat line last week, but that was largely because of game flow and two early touchdowns from Philadelphia’s defense. Foles still gets a respectable Tier 4 placement. Cam Newton hasn’t had a great start since his return from injury, but the Carolina coaching staff has come out and said it is purposely holding him back from running. Newton is in Tier 5 this week with Tony Romo and Eli Manning. Experts are staying conservative after Manning’s blowup game last week, which was against a soft Washington defense. Tom Brady continued his regression and was unable to find open receivers Monday night against Kansas City. Brady drops to Tier 7. Running back DeMarco Murray and Le’Veon Bell have earned their Tier 1 status after four weeks of domination. Eddie Lacy (Tier 3) did not have the breakout game against Chicago many were expecting, but operating as the primary and goal line back in Green Bay makes him a must start. Jerick McKinnon (Tier 9) had his breakout game last week, going 135 yards on 18 touches, but the Minnesota coaching staff says it is sticking with Matt Asiata (Tier 6) as the starter and goal line back. McKinnon is the better runner. Being the better pass protector and pass catcher, Asiata will get more snaps than McKinnon. Justin Forsett has been the most consistent Baltimore running back, and gets bumped up to Tier 7. Lorenzo Taliaferro (Tier 11) is the second best fantasy option there. Bernard Pierce is not recommended this week. The Patriots' offensive struggles downgrade Shane Vereen to Tier 8 and Stevan Ridley to Tier 9. Wide Receiver Antonio Brown’s playmaking ability and a juicy matchup against Jacksonville have locked him in as the No. 1 wide receiver this week. Detroit admitted to using Calvin Johnson as a decoy last week. He should be healthy this week and is locked in as a Tier 1 receiver again. Vincent Jackson should benefit from Mike Glennon under center and Mike Evans out for injury, and is a solid bet in Tier 4 in a potential shootout against New Orleans. The gap between Andre Johnson (Tier 5) and DeAndre Hopkins (Tier 6) is closing, but both are solid starts this week. Michael Crabtree and Julian Edelman join Hopkins in Tier 6, which is the last high wide receiver tier this week, as the falloff to Brandin Cooks in Tier 7 is quite large. Cooks and Marques Colston (Tier 8) are only one tier apart, as it’s anyone guess as to which of them will get more looks from Drew Brees. Wes Welker looks like he is the fourth passing option in Denver now and gets a conservative Tier 7 placement. Larry Fitzgerald has fallen to Tier 7 as well — Michael Floyd (Tier 5) has passed him in Arizona and John Brown (Tier 12) is on the rise as well. The Vikings have failed to use Cordarrelle Patterson in the past couple weeks. This, in combination with a rainy forecast and short week for an away game in Green Bay, leaves Patterson in Tier 8. Sammy Watkins and Brian Quick are in similar situations — each is the clear top receiver on his team, but quarterback worries keep them in Tier 8. Eddie Royal (Tier 10) and Allen Hurns (Tier 11) have had an unsustainable high amount of touchdowns, which experts do not expect to continue. Tight End Larry Donnell’s three-touchdown breakout game Thursday night gets him a Tier 2 slot, though the high ranking is more because of his consistent target count as Eli Manning’s security blanket. Also in Tier 2 is Martellus Bennett, who has proved he is part of the Bears’ receiving triple threat. The expert favorite Travis Kelce continues to rise up the tiers after his domination of the Patriots’ defense, much of which was done after catching the ball. Zach Ertz falls to Tier 4 this week, with only six catches for 57 yards in his last two games. Niles Paul is currently in Tier 5, but his status is volatile with his brutal concussion last week and Jordan Reed’s possible return. Note that Washington plays Monday night, so consider other Tier 5 and 6 options like Austin Seferian-Jenkins, who played in all 71 of Tampa Bay’s snaps last week.
