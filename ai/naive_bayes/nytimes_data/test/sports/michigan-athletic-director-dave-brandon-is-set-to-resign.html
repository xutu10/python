Under pressure from Michigan’s board of regents, on which he used to sit, Dave Brandon planned to resign as athletic director of the university Friday after nearly five years in the role. A source familiar with the university’s thinking confirmed the resignation. Michigan said Mark Schlissel, the university president, has scheduled a news conference for 1:30 p.m. Under Brandon’s tenure, Michigan’s proud football program — which has the most wins in college football history — has displayed an on-field decline under Coach Brady Hoke. The Wolverines were 7-6 last season and are 3-5 (1-3 Big Ten) heading into Saturday’s homecoming game against Indiana. Brandon, 62, had become a lightning rod at Michigan, not just because of the football team’s ineptitude or the  Still, discontent with the football program alchemized into national news — with blame shifting from Hoke to Brandon — in the aftermath of Michigan’s 30-14 loss at home to Minnesota on Sept. 27. The sophomore quarterback Shane Morris appeared to take a blow to the head and become dazed, but he was kept in the game for another play and reinserted later for another. At a news conference the next Monday, Hoke would not confirm that Morris had been concussed. Brandon revealed the next day that Morris had received a diagnosis of a probable mild concussion on the day after the game, although Hoke had apparently not been informed.
