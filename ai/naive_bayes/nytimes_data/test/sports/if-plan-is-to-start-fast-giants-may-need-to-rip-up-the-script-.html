If Plan Is to ‘Start Fast,’ Giants May Need to Rip Up the Script 
The Giants have not scored on their opening drive for 19 consecutive games and have been outscored this season in the first quarter by 51-14.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —  It is customary for an N.F.L. team to script the first 10 to 15 plays it plans to run to start each game. The offensive coordinator, after spending days and nights studying the defense of the next opponent, usually designs a sequence of plays he thinks have a high chance of success based on his team’s strengths and the other team’s weaknesses. The starting quarterback offers opinions, too. It is not a trivial exercise but a prized opportunity to formulate an early plan of attack in the quiet of an office or film room at midweek instead of under pressure on the sideline at the start of a game. Such a strategy has proved especially fruitful for some of the best offensive teams in N.F.L. history, known for smoothly yet craftily marching downfield on their first possessions to score touchdowns or field goals that left defenses scrambling to adjust. Those early scores gave teams more than a psychological or tactical advantage. A team that scores first is more likely to win the game. Some research measuring games since the 1970s suggests that teams taking the lead first have won 65 percent of the time. Consider, then, the Giants, who enter Sunday’s road game against the  The 2014 Giants have advanced out of their own territory on the game’s opening drive once (the one that ended with the interception). It is little wonder that the Giants (3-5) have been outscored in the first quarter by 51-14. On average, the Giants’ first series this season has stalled at their own 38-yard line. The eight opening drives have, on average, gained 16.3 yards. In the last three games, all losses, the Giants’ opening drive has lasted an average of four plays for a gain of only 9.3 yards. Contrast that with the production of the Indianapolis Colts, who have the league’s top-ranked offense. The opening drive for the Colts has averaged 40.8 yards, and they have scored nearly half the time. Giants Coach “We use the phrase ‘start fast’ around the team all the time; we’ve been saying it pretty much all year,” Coughlin said. “But we don’t seem to grasp that.” There is no pattern to what is going wrong, he said. “It’s something different all the time,” Coughlin said. “Those are the better plays coming off the practice week. But let’s face it: We miss opportunities when they are there. We miss plays.” Manning knows the “start fast” mantra as well. “It helps to get some early first downs, get some points, get the lead — it always has,” Manning said. “I think sometimes we’ve been trying to get some runs early to establish something, and we’ve ended up going backward. So we end up in third-and-long. And then sometimes we’ve had a few drives where we’ve moved the ball some but we haven’t finished them off.” On their first offensive play of the eight games this season, the Giants have run five times. Three of those first-play rushes have ended with a running back tackled behind the line of scrimmage. On their second play, the Giants have run five times for a total of 12 yards. Manning was correct when he said the Giants often faced a third-and-long situation early in the game. One of the Giants’ opening drives stalled when they could not convert on third-and-16. Two others ended after third-and-11 situations. Others came to halt after a third-and-10, a third-and-9 and a third-and-8. The man who devises the opening sequence of plays, the new offensive coordinator, Ben McAdoo, said he did not go into the games with the same first plays. “Every game is different,” said McAdoo, who added that the Giants dedicated practice time specifically to executing the opening drive efficiently. “There are times when we came out and moved the football, but we didn’t finish drives,” McAdoo said. “The problem a lot of times has been that we haven’t started on first or second down the way we would like to.” So when the Giants try to get an early lead and gather momentum, only to trail after the first quarter, the problem could come down to the most elemental steps. It is not merely the opening drive but the opening play or two. Or does it go back further than that? “We haven’t won too many coin tosses, either, to be honest with you,” Coughlin said of the ceremony at midfield before each game. “I’ve also kept that chart.” The Giants have lost five of eight coin tosses.
