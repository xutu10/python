North Carolina State, Seeking a Wolf Mascot, Settles for Tuffy the Dog
After many attempts at using a real wolf, an animal skittish by nature, North Carolina State has settled on a dog that resembles one as its mascot.

RALEIGH, N.C. — Tuffy the wolf is the official live mascot of the  There are a few details about Tuffy the wolf you probably should know. First, his name is not Tuffy. Also, he is not really a wolf. But who is to quibble after the university delivered the mascot fans have demanded at football games for decades? According to Tim Peeler, the unofficial historian of North Carolina State athletics, it all started in 1921, when someone at the institution — originally an agricultural and technical school whose teams were unofficially nicknamed everything from the Techs to the Aggies and even the Farmers — called some of the football players as unruly as a pack of wolves. In 1947, the nickname Wolfpack was formally adopted. Back in the 1940s, according to a book by the former professor Bill Beezley, cheerleaders would bring a timber wolf named State to games. But State was too afraid — he would “cringe and cry” when he was in the stadium. He was eventually sold to a traveling circus. Another wolf named Lobo I came in 1959, but he died not long after arriving and was quickly replaced by Lobo II. That one did not last much longer. A timber wolf who was rolled out in a cage during games, Lobo II was so traumatized by the thousands of screaming fans that he had a nervous breakdown and never recovered. One night, his cage was left open and he ran away into the woods, never to return. None of this should have come as a surprise to anyone who understands wolves. They are nocturnal animals who do not like being around humans. It would be difficult to pick a worse atmosphere for a wolf than a packed football stadium on a Saturday afternoon. That did not stop North Carolina State from trying. Fans and students sold 25-cent shares and collected enough money to buy yet another timber wolf in 1966. This time, it worked out for a while. Lobo III was comfortable around people and used to delight fans by howling on the sideline. He was the perfect fit. Or so it seemed. One day, a zoology professor took a closer look. It turned out that Lobo III was a coyote. Lobo III fell out of favor with fans when his true identity was revealed, and he was retired in 1970. North Carolina State tried once more, bringing a pack of Siberian huskies and Alaskan malamutes to the sidelines in the early 1970s. Fans did not embrace the dogs, either. And that was the end of the live mascots at the university until 2010, when students and fans pressed the new athletic director, Debbie Yow, to approve one again. The former assistant athletic director Dick Christy was given the task of finding it. “It was pretty much dead in the water from the start to try and get a live wolf,” said Christy, now the athletic director at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. Fortunately, officials had heard about a new breed of dog that looked just like a wolf: The Tamaskan is a mix of German shepherd, Alaskan malamute and Siberian husky, first bred in Finland in the 2000s. And there was a Tamaskan club in North Carolina. After one false start, the Wolfpack worked out an agreement with a family that owns a 110-pound pet Tamaskan named Wave. His stage name is Tuffy, after the cartoon Wolfpack logo. Tuffy’s location and family remain anonymous to protect them — there have been two episodes of deliberate poisoning of Tamaskans in North Carolina, including Tuffy’s sire, who later died. Tuffy is now in his fifth season on North Carolina State’s sidelines. He does not always enjoy the cannon that goes off when the Wolfpack scores. But he is great with people. So what if Tuffy the wolf is really Wave the dog? At last, North Carolina State has the mascot fans have always wanted. Sort of.
