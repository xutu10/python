Former Boxer John Duddy Hopes for Success as an Actor
After taking his lumps, and experiencing some success, in what he termed “a tough business,” the Irishman John Duddy has found a new calling.

John Duddy, a former middleweight boxer, leaned against a moving truck parked in front of a residential high-rise along Central Park West. “This is one of the most beautiful buildings in the city,” said Duddy, his sleepy blue eyes brightening on a recent afternoon. “I really love it around here.” Duddy, 35, was not far from Madison Square Garden, where he fought, and won, nine times in recent years, his fan base bolstered by a loyal legion from his native Ireland. Although Duddy achieved a good measure of fame, thrilling crowds with a willingness to exchange big punches in the middle of the ring, he said he was “financially mishandled” for most of his eight-year career and did not reap the monetary reward he thought he deserved. “Boxing is a tough business,” he said, his face partly hidden behind a short beard that is as thick as his brogue. Duddy then began lugging someone else’s belongings into the high-rise, as he is now employed by a moving company based in the Bronx. “Things are a little different for me these days, but I still have to put bread on the table,” said Duddy, who is married and rents an apartment in the Middle Village section of Queens with his wife, Grainne, who is a hostess at a nearby bar. “Now I’m doing some honest work that helps pay the bills and doesn’t involve me getting beat up,” said Duddy, laughing as he carefully pushed a handcart stacked with boxes into a freight elevator. “Obviously, I’m not financially set for life, so moving is something I can do until the next best thing comes along.” The next best thing appears to be an  Duddy worked on the set of last year’s “ Duddy said that De Niro later placed a call on his behalf to cast him in a film about the boxer Roberto Duran, “Hands of Stone,” which stars De Niro as Duran’s former trainer, Ray Arcel. Duddy, who plays the fighter Ken Buchanan, filmed scenes in Los Angeles and in Duran’s native Panama. The movie is scheduled for release next year. “Being involved in a project like that was one of the greatest experiences of my life,” said Duddy, who is 5-foot-11 and has maintained his fighting weight, 160 pounds. “In one scene, we were filming a news conference, when it finally hit me. I’m standing there thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m shooting a scene with Robert De Niro.’ ” Known as the Derry Destroyer, a homage to his hometown in Ireland, or simply as “Ireland’s John Duddy,” he retired from boxing in January 2011  One of the highlights of Duddy’s career came at the Garden in September 2006, when he defeated the highly regarded Luis “Yori Boy” Campas by  Though Duddy earned the fairly insignificant International Boxing Association middleweight title that night, he had become the people’s champion. “I was very fortunate that New Yorkers took me under their wing,” he said. “There are so many working-class people in this city, and I was a working-class fighter. That’s why we connected.” In November 2008, when Duddy was widely considered the most prominent Irish boxer in the world, he parted ways with Irish Ropes, the company that represented him. Duddy said: “I never knew how much money my fights generated, or how much money was coming in or going out. I was always kept in the dark. I was definitely mishandled, kind of like a horse led by a carrot from one fight to the next, always being told that my next fight would bring in more money. I trusted with my heart and kept fighting with my heart, but your heart can only take you so far in that business. After a while, you have to open your eyes and start thinking on your feet.” Asked how much money he had earned in boxing, and how much money he thought he had been shortchanged, Duddy smiled and politely said, “That’s none of your business.” But Duddy acknowledged that he was involved in an unusual business arrangement that created what he considered a conflict of interest. He was guided by two brothers. Eddie McLoughlin, who founded and controlled Irish Ropes, was Duddy’s promoter; Tony McLoughlin was Duddy’s manager. When reached by phone to discuss Duddy’s dealings with Irish Ropes, Tony McLoughlin said, “I don’t want to talk about it,” and hung up. Several contact numbers for Eddie McLoughlin were disconnected, and he could not be reached for comment. Duddy eventually turned to a new manager, Craig Hamilton, who contended that Duddy had been cheated out of “hundreds of thousands of dollars” by Irish Ropes. Hamilton said, “This was life-changing money that certainly would have afforded John some different choices in life.” They eventually settled a lawsuit out of court. Duddy’s final five professional bouts were fought under Hamilton, who accused Irish Ropes, now defunct, of “not giving John his fair share of the money he had earned in the ring.” “He was mishandled in terms of what he was receiving financially,” Hamilton said. “It was egregious. John had no real representation because his manager was the brother of the promoter, and you don’t have to be a Harvard graduate to understand how that is a conflict of interest. These guys were making deals and whacking up money, and it cost John a lot of dough.” Jim Borzell, who was the director of boxing for Irish Ropes, called Hamilton’s assertions “pure nonsense.” “Duddy was getting bad advice from the guys at the end of the bar and decided he was being ripped off,” Borzell said. “That wasn’t the case.” Borzell said that Duddy had, in the end, chosen the perfect second career for himself. “Wherever he went, women crowded three deep around John Duddy,” Borzell said. “The kid has movie-star good looks and a ton of charisma. I think he has a real future in show business.” Duddy has done some theatrical work in recent years. Shortly after he retired from the ring, he played the title role in “Kid Shamrock,” a 2011 Off Broadway production based on the life of “Irish” Bobby Cassidy, a former world-ranked boxer. More recently, Duddy  “I’ve fallen in love with the whole notion of being involved with the cast and crew and the light technicians and the stunt guys and the director,” Duddy said. “It’s a wonderful feeling, and much different than the feeling I had in boxing, where I was totally alone in the ring. On a movie set, you have this whole family around you.” Duddy unloaded the boxes and returned to the moving truck. He checked his cellphone for messages, always hoping for a call about another potential acting job. “Once in a while, when I’m working around town, I get recognized by a sanitation man or a police officer or someone else who was a fan of mine,” Duddy said. “It’s wonderful to know that some people haven’t forgotten what I did in the ring. And hopefully, one day, they’ll also remember me for what I accomplished on the stage and on screen.”
