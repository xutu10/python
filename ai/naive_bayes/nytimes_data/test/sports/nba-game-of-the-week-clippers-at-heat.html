N.B.A. Game of the Week: Clippers at Heat
A meeting between Los Angeles and Miami may help show whether the early play of two of last season’s top teams is a good indicator of their playoff potential.

Every week, The New York Times will choose one essential game to watch, highlighting hot teams, winning and losing streaks and statistical intrigue in the N.B.A. Los Angeles Clippers The Clippers and the Heat, both near the top of their conferences last year, find themselves midtier after their first 10 games. Challenges were expected for the Heat after they lost LeBron James this summer. The Clippers’ troubles are more surprising. The Clippers (5-3) have had good wins against Portland and Phoenix, but more often they have crumbled against top competitors, falling to three other Western Conference teams, the Golden State Warriors, the San Antonio Spurs and the  These losses have been instructive. In all of them, the Clippers shot poorly, particularly from the 3-point line. But it is still early, and there is plenty of time for several of the team’s players to break out of shooting slumps. Blake Griffin has the lowest shooting percentage of his career — while taking more shots than ever — and the usually helpful Matt Barnes has not been able to hit much of anything. But they are dealing with distractions off the court — Griffin was recently  The bigger problem for the Clippers is their defense. Entering Sunday, they were ranked 21st in the league in points allowed. They have permitted weaker teams like the Los Angeles Lakers and the Utah Jazz to score more than 100 points against them. Sometimes individual defenders are the concern — for example, Jamal Crawford struggled to stay with the Spurs’ Kawhi Leonard last week. But more often, the Clippers, once so coordinated on defense, simply do not seem to be communicating. The Clippers will sort out their offensive struggles; they have too much raw talent and are too pass-happy to fail on that end. But their coach, Doc Rivers, will have to shape up the defense for the team to again become a top threat in the West. The story in Miami has been less the void that James left than the re-emergence of Chris Bosh as a superstar. Bosh was often thought of as the shakiest leg of the Heat’s Big Three, but he has been a force to start the season. He has helped the Heat top two of the best teams in the Eastern Conference, the Wizards and the Raptors, while anchoring a lineup of overachievers that has made the once-flashy Heat resemble their old rivals the Chicago Bulls in their grit and resourcefulness. The Heat’s ball movement remains a pleasure to watch. Entering Sunday, they were eighth in the league in assists and seventh over all in offensive rating, averaging  Which is not to say that everything has been easy for the Heat (5-5). They have dropped consecutive games to the Indiana Pacers, the Atlanta Hawks and the Milwaukee Bucks, with two of those defeats coming at home. Against the Pacers, the Heat could not score, and in Atlanta, they could not stop the Hawks from scoring. What has really emerged in James’s absence has been the team’s inability to reach a higher gear when necessary, either on offense or defense. The Heat have not fallen to the depths of the league without James, but they no longer look like contenders. Instead they are scrapping for a playoff berth in the weaker East. In the absence of unexpected developments, like the talented forward Shawne Williams blossoming into a superstar overnight, it is tough to see Miami making it back to the finals for some time. For teams such as the Heat, looking to execute in a new way, the early part of the season is a time for experimentation, to test what works and what doesn’t. The Heat might have hit a few speed bumps recently, but so far, they have probably exceeded expectations. Thursday’s game is a great test for both teams. Are the Heat actually better than we thought they would be? Or are the Clippers far worse?
