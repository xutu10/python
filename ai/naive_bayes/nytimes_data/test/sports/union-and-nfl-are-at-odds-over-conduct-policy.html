Union and N.F.L. Are at Odds Over Conduct Policy
Team owners, meeting in Irving, Tex., could vote on changes to the personal conduct policy that may include stiffer penalties for players accused of domestic abuse.

DALLAS —  When Commissioner Roger Goodell promised in September to overhaul the  What appeared to be a fig leaf has turned out to be a thorn bush. The past three months, the union and league have sparred over how to discuss any changes to the personal conduct policy, which gives Goodell broad powers to penalize players. The league said that it was eager to get the players’ say, but that it ultimately controlled the personal conduct policy. The union, which has accused Goodell of being heavy-handed, wants any changes to the policy, now and in the future, to be negotiated through collective bargaining. The standoff could escalate soon. On Wednesday, the 32 team owners will meet in Irving, Tex., where they are expected to review and potentially vote on proposed changes to the personal conduct policy that may include stiffer penalties for players accused of domestic abuse, as well as changes to Goodell’s role in assessing those penalties. To date, Goodell has both handed out penalties and heard appeals from players who dispute the punishment. The union wants an independent arbitrator to hear all appeals. If the union, which fears that its members’ due-process rights may be violated, is unhappy with the new changes, it could file a grievance and force an arbitrator to determine whether the league violated the current labor agreement by not formally negotiating the changes to the deal. “The way the N.F.L. is making things up as it goes along, the players won’t stand for that,” said Richard Sherman, a player representative for the Seattle Seahawks. George Atallah, a spokesman for the union, said the players association was keeping all options open. It is unclear whether that includes ultimately taking the league to court. On Oct. 28, the union gave the N.F.L. its proposed changes to the policy, including discipline for players only when they have been accused of a felony and convicted of that offense. Jeff Pash, the league’s top lawyer, said the union’s proposal would “narrow the policy’s scope and discipline for certain violations.” He said that in many states, domestic violence was treated as a misdemeanor, not a felony. “The personal conduct policy has always made clear that the standard of conduct is higher than simply not being guilty of a crime,” Pash wrote in a letter to the union. Pash also disagreed with a union proposal that aimed to prevent the N.F.L. from placing players on paid leave, as it did with Peterson after he was arrested and accused of beating his son, without the player’s or the union’s consent. The current collective bargaining agreement has seven years left, so the union has little leverage in talks with the league. The players are also aware that they are in the awkward position of trying to protect their rights while the public focuses on instances of domestic violence. “Defending due process is not the same as defending these actions,” said Zach Streif, a player representative on the New Orleans Saints.
