Week 16 N.F.L. Matchups

===
Eagles (9-5) at Redskins (3-11)   4:30 p.m. Saturday Line: Eagles by 8 It is hard to find positive things to say about a season as bad as the one Washington has endured, but one thing it does well is stop the run. Allowing an average of 101 yards a game on the ground, good for seventh in the N.F.L., the Redskins smothered LeSean McCoy, Philadelphia’s star running back, limiting him to 22 yards on 19 carries in Week 3. McCoy was all smiles when he was  Pick: Eagles Chargers (8-6) at 49ers (7-7)   8:25 p.m. Saturday Line: 49ers by 1 Regression to the mean is a statistical phenomenon in which a player or a team performing far above or below expectations can be reasonably expected to have the pendulum swing quickly the other way. San Francisco fans desperate for a win in a season that has quickly collapsed can hope that regressing to the mean is the 49ers’ ticket to a victory. A team with that much talent cannot be as bad as it has played in recent weeks. Given the number of injuries the team has endured, and the drama regarding Coach  Pick: Chargers Colts (10-4) at Cowboys (10-4)   4:25 p.m. Sunday Line: Cowboys by 3 Tony Romo played with fractured bones in his back this season, so the question of whether DeMarco Murray will miss Dallas’s game because of a broken left hand seems almost ridiculous. Murray, the league’s leading rusher, broke the fourth metacarpal, which is the long bone on the lower part of his ring finger. He carries the ball with his right hand and was expected to be mostly unaffected after having surgery Monday. Two days later, he was on the practice field, although the Cowboys officially listed him as a nonparticipant. Regardless, Coach Jason Garrett and Jerry Jones, the team’s owner, made it clear that they expected him to play. “The biggest question we have to ask ourselves is, is he functional to do his job?” Garrett said. “Can he hold the football? Can he carry it under duress? Can he block? Can he do the things necessary to play the position?” Murray is a large factor in his team’s chances against the Colts, but he is also on the verge of the Cowboys’ single-season rushing record. With two games remaining, he needs 87 yards to top the 1,773 gained in the 1995 season by Emmitt Smith, the league’s career leading rusher. More important for Dallas, the team won the  Pick: Cowboys Seahawks (10-4) at Cardinals (11-3)   8:30 p.m. Sunday Line: Seahawks by 9 Ryan Lindley has thrown 181 passes in his N.F.L. career, and not one has resulted in a touchdown. Lindley, signed by Arizona off San Diego’s practice squad last month, has the task of facing the league’s best defense. It is not hard to imagine what could go wrong. The Cardinals will try to follow the blueprint of their Week 15 win against St. Louis: Smother the opposing offense and hope that some combination of special teams and turnovers can provide the points necessary to win. Given the Seahawks’ overall talent, it seems unlikely that such a strategy will work, But a win would set a Cardinals franchise record and give Arizona home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, including the Super Bowl. Pick: Seahawks Ravens (9-5) at Texans (7-7)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Ravens by 6 Baltimore’s defense has relied on a heavy pass rush this season, with Elvis Dumervil and Terrell Suggs wreaking havoc each week, but it has had no luck keeping its secondary healthy. After placing Asa Jackson on injured reserve, the Ravens signed Chris Greenwood, who will be the 13th cornerback to spend time on their roster this season. The inability to field a consistent lineup shows in the statistics, as the Ravens are allowing 259.9 yards a game through the air, which ranks 30th among the 32 N.F.L. teams. Luckily for Baltimore, Houston spent the week deciding whether to start a third-string or a fourth-string quarterback, so there is little reason to worry. Pick: Ravens Lions (10-4) at Bears (5-9)  1 p.m. Sunday Line: Lions by 9 For many fans, Jimmy Clausen will always be the boy with spiky hair holding up his three high school championship rings as he announced his intention to play for Notre Dame. Part of the reason that image endures is that Clausen did little at Notre Dame, or in the N.F.L., to make anyone forget it. After a terrible rookie season in 2010, when he went 1-9 as a starter, he did not throw a pass in a game for three seasons. With two games to go this season, Coach Marc Trestman appears ready to hand Chicago’s offense to Clausen to see what he can do. If he can succeed where Jay Cutler failed, perhaps the old photo can finally fade from memory. Pick: Lions Vikings (6-8) at Dolphins (7-7)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Dolphins by 6 ½ Minnesota has fought through losing its biggest star to a suspension and has remained respectable as it waits for its quarterback of the future, Teddy Bridgewater, to develop. Miami has at times seemed ready to take the leap to become a real contender but it seems to short-circuit regularly and waste its chances. The Dolphins could reach the playoffs if they win their final two games and get some help from other teams. But after a thrashing by New England in Week 15, Miami does not appear to have much fight left. Pick: Vikings Browns (7-7) at Panthers (5-8-1)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Panthers by 4 It would be hard for Johnny Manziel to perform worse than he did last weekend, in his first N.F.L. start. Cleveland ran just 38 offensive plays, the fewest by a team this season. Only three of the Browns’ five first downs could be attributed to the offense, with the other two coming because of penalties, and Cleveland crossed the 50-yard line once. Cam Newton is likely to return after practicing in a limited fashion, and Carolina still has a legitimate chance to reach the playoffs, so even some improvement by Manziel would probably not be enough for Cleveland to win. Pick: Panthers Falcons (5-9) at Saints (6-8)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Saints by 6.5 Atlanta is the worst team in the N.F.L. at preventing the pass. Saints quarterback Drew Brees has recorded more than 4,000 passing yards in nine consecutive seasons. Pick: Saints Packers (10-4) at Buccaneers (2-12)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Packers by 11 ½ Gerald McCoy understands how important he is to Tampa Bay. A dominant defensive lineman who has been one of the few bright spots in a dismal season, McCoy has been shut down with a sprained ankle because his future is more important than a few games the Buccaneers were likely to lose anyway. “Of course, you want to finish the games with your guys,” McCoy said, “but you have to look at the bigger picture, and that’s my overall health. I think we have a lot of great — not good, great — ahead of us for this team, this organization.” Pick: Packers Chiefs (8-6) at Steelers (9-5)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Steelers by 3 Pittsburgh has set a number of franchise records this season as Ben Roethlisberger, Le’Veon Bell and Antonio Brown have lit up the scoreboard. Along the way, the Steelers’ defense has done its best to burn the scoreboard down, allowing averages of 356 yards a game along with 24.2 points a game, which ranks 20th in the N.F.L. The Steelers have not finished that low since 1991, which was Chuck Noll’s last season as their coach. Pick: Chiefs Patriots (11-3) at Jets (3-11)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Patriots by 10 ½ The Jets can run the ball, and they still play elite defense, but passing for an average of 169 yards a game is not going to result in a lot of wins. Coach Rex Ryan has a history of giving New England a harder time than most, but his inability to find a quarterback solution could cost him his job. Pick: Patriots Giants (5-9) at Rams (6-8)   4:05 p.m. Sunday Line: Rams by 6 ½ If St. Louis could find some offensive consistency, its defense would be getting a lot more notice. The Rams have not allowed a touchdown in three games, with two shutouts before a 12-6 loss to Arizona in Week 15. They stand as good a chance as any other team to limit Odell Beckham Jr.’s ascent as one of the league’s most dangerous wide receivers. Pick: Rams Bills (8-6) at Raiders (2-12)   4:25 p.m. Sunday Line: Bills by 6 ½ After shutting down Aaron Rodgers and Peyton Manning, Buffalo has little reason to fear Oakland quarterback Derek Carr. But just as the Bills maintained their inexplicable home-field advantage over the Packers in Week 15, the Raiders have a similar one over the Bills: Buffalo has not won a game in Oakland since 1966, though it did win a game against the Raiders in Los Angeles in 1991 — in overtime. Pick: Bills Broncos (11-3) at Bengals (9-4-1)   8:30 p.m. Monday Line: Broncos 3 ½ Peyton Manning did not pass for more than 257 yards in any of Denver’s last four games, but the Broncos went 4-0 because of a yeoman effort by C. J. Anderson, who came out of nowhere to stabilize the ground game. At some point before the playoffs, the Broncos will want Manning back in a groove. But even though he has taken a small step back, he still had seven touchdown passes and just two interceptions in the last four games. Cincinnati has its head held high after humiliating Johnny Manziel, but there is a big difference between stopping a quarterback with zero touchdown passes in his career and one who has 528. Pick: Broncos
