Jose Altuve Wins Batting Title on the Field
After originally sitting the All-Star second baseman, the Astros reversed course, and Altuve started, went 2 for 4, and won the league batting title at .341.

The  Altuve entered the game with a .340 batting average, tops in the American League, but he was only slightly ahead of Detroit’s Victor Martinez, batting .337. No Astros player had won a batting crown, and to help secure this feat, the team decided to withhold Altuve from the order. This did not sit well with fans or Altuve, who made it clear before the game that the decision was not his. “I wanted to play,” Altuve told reporters before the game at Citi Field, which  At 12:35 p.m., about 35 minutes before the first pitch, Houston reversed course and announced via Twitter that Altuve would be inserted in the lineup, batting second instead of Marwin Gonzalez. Altuve wound up going 2 for 4 with a double to earn the batting title outright, ending the season at .341, 6 points ahead of Martinez, who went 0 for 3 against Minnesota. Altuve also ended the season leading the majors in hits with 225, a franchise record. Citi Field was the site of another batting title controversy, in 2011. Shortstop Jose Reyes, in his final game in a Mets uniform, pulled himself out after a leadoff bunt single that essentially locked up the first batting crown in Mets history. Some fans were displeased with the way that unfolded as well.
