Brad Keselowski, a Driver Who Infuriates, Makes a Run for the Title
Keselowski is pursuing his second Sprint Cup championship after escaping elimination at Talladega Superspeedway on Oct. 19.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. —  In the last two weeks, Brad Keselowski has fought with drivers on and off the track, received a fine for bad behavior from a sanctioning body that has yet to figure out how to control him, and taken the news media to task for its coverage of it all. But that is only part of the reason Keselowski has managed to make himself the focal point of this year’s Chase for the Sprint Cup. With four races to go before Nascar crowns its annual champion, Keselowski may also be the driver to beat. And if he happens to infuriate the rest of the field on his way to winning a second career championship, so be it. “My No. 1 goal in racing was never to be the most popular driver,” Keselowski said recently before the teams headed to Martinsville Speedway in Virginia for Sunday’s Sprint Cup race.  “My goal is to win races and to achieve the highest level of success on the racetrack possible. And sometimes those goals are in direct conflict with popularity and financial potential, etc., and I’m O.K. with that.” If only the rest of Nascar were O.K. with it, too. Keselowski is one of eight drivers to reach the third round — called  Keselowski leads all drivers with six victories for the season, none more consequential than his win at Talladega Superspeedway on Oct. 19. Facing potential elimination from the Chase in the second round, Keselowski was one of three drivers, along with the six-time champion Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr., who needed to win at Talladega to advance. In the end, Keselowski drove away with the checkered flag, while Johnson and Earnhardt were bumped from the playoff. It was a signature victory for Keselowski, 30, in a career that has been spent mostly in the spotlight and occasionally in the doghouse. The win came a week after a 16th-place finish at Charlotte Motor Speedway on Oct. 11 that left Keselowski 10th in the standings and $50,000 lighter in the pocket after ramming his No. 2 Ford into Kenseth’s No. 20 Toyota on pit road after the race. That led to  None of this was a surprise. Keselowski has been angering drivers ever since he won his first Cup race at Talladega in 2009, sending Edwards airborne on the way. There have been enough confrontations over the years to earn Keselowski a reputation among drivers and fans, who have taken to jeering him during driver introductions. Over the years, he has been chastised by Nascar. He was fined for posting on Twitter and angered Nascar with criticism of penalties and a change to fuel-injection technology. Through it all, he wins. Keselowski has 16 Sprint Cup victories in his career, along with his 2012 championship. And he is compelling television for Nascar. Keselowski turned heads with his victory at Chicagoland to start the Chase on Sept. 14 when he powered into an opening between Harvick and Kyle Larson as they battled for the lead in the final laps, taking away what looked to be a sure victory for either of them. That’s why Keselowski has earned some respect from other drivers. Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean they like him. After Keselowski won at Talladega, the team owner Roger Penske called criticism of him mere jealousy. That earned a sideways glance or chuckle from some. “I think you all know that’s a joke,” Hamlin said. “There’s nobody jealous of Brad. Nobody wants to be Brad. Nobody who knows him wants to be Brad.” Given the enemies Keselowski has made in his career — Kurt Busch threatened to wreck him after the last race at Martinsville in March — he could face retaliation Sunday. Martinsville is a half-mile oval with close racing and ample opportunity for drivers to exact revenge. Keselowski, who will start in sixth place, has  “I just don’t want to get in the middle of it,” Harvick said. “I don’t want to get in the middle of his problems, because he’s definitely got some problems.” Keselowski does have time and memory on his side, though. He warned other drivers that there would be payback down the road for anything that happened Sunday to affect his chances at a title. “Oh, I’ve made people angry my whole career,” Keselowski said. “And I’ll probably make people angry again. That’s how the sport works. “If there’s anybody wanting to go down that road, we’ll be right there with them for the next 10 years that they’re in the sport. I think it’s probably in everyone’s collective interest not to go down that path.”
