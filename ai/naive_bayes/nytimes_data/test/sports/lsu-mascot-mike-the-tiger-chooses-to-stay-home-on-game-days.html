L.S.U. Mascot Mike the Tiger Chooses to Stay Home on Game Days
For all seven of L.S.U.'s home games this season, Mike the Tiger has refused to leave his well-appointed residence for the mobile cage that would take him into the stadium.

BATON ROUGE, La. — Few universities venerate their sports mascots as much as Louisiana State cherishes Mike the Tiger — or Mike VI, as he is formally known here. He resides in a  “He is a pampered cat in every sense of the word,” said Dan Borne, the longtime public-address announcer at L.S.U. football games. Perhaps too pampered. When the No. 14 Tigers took the field Saturday night for a nationally televised game against No. 4 Alabama with playoff implications, their beloved mascot once again did not join them. For all seven home games this season, Mike has refused to leave his well-appointed residence for the mobile cage that would take him into the stadium. For decades, L.S.U. cheerleaders have perched atop the trailer of Mike and his predecessors as it is driven around the field before games. The fans scream their approval at the procession, which stops outside the visitors’ locker room. If the home team is lucky, Mike roars as the opposing players head to the field. But Mike’s caretakers say they cannot and will not force him into the trailer, and this season he has preferred to spend game days striding around what Borne called his condo, comfortably removed from the masses in the newly expanded Tiger Stadium whose din may be as irritating to tigers as to visiting teams. At a university and in a state where people obsess over symbols, history and tradition, though, Mike’s no-shows are starting to cause consternation and curiosity. “With Republicans taking Congress, this has been a very good week for red elephants,” said T-Bob Hebert, a former L.S.U. lineman who has a sports talk radio show in New Orleans. “So we might need something to offset the rise of the red elephant.” He was partly referring to the Crimson Tide’s mascot, a costumed elephant in a red jersey who runs around during Alabama games. But Big Al, Alabama’s mascot, is no Mike. The political strategist James Carville, an L.S.U. graduate and an avid football fan, has joked that Mike has the best health care in Louisiana. Tiger iconography is ubiquitous here. A bronze statue of Mike stands outside the stadium. Midfield is emblazoned not with “L.S.U.” but with a purple-and-gold tiger eye. When visiting fans walk through the student section, they are met with “Tiger Bait!” chants. Even the A.T.M.s in the concourses feature a screen shot of a tiger approaching. Yet the genuine article has made himself scarce, and Mike’s caretakers have become deferential as attitudes toward animals have evolved. Scott Rabalais, a sports columnist for The Advocate of Baton Rouge, said the mascot’s absence was increasingly becoming a topic of conversation on campus. He said a student in the graduate journalism class he teaches at L.S.U. had recently written a paper documenting the number of games Mike had missed in recent seasons. Borne, however, said he could not blame Mike for staying home. After all, more than a few college football fans enjoy sitting outside stadiums alongside their vehicles, watching games on television while enjoying beverages and food fare far superior to the offerings inside. “My vision of Mike,” Borne said, “is that he’s inside there, he’s got four or five high-def screens, a remote control the size of Vermont for that big paw, and he’s just watching all the great football going on on Saturdays.” The Day’s Best MAXX WILLIAMS The redshirt sophomore tight end caught three of quarterback Mitch Leidner’s four touchdown passes, and host Minnesota routed Iowa, 51-14, to reclaim the Floyd of Rosedale Trophy, a bronze pig, after a two-year absence. Williams, who has already set the single-season team record for touchdown catches by a tight end with seven, scored from 9, 4 and 3 yards. The Golden Gophers moved into a first-place tie with Wisconsin and idle Nebraska in the Big Ten’s West Division. DANE EVANS The sophomore quarterback threw for five touchdowns to lead host Tulsa to a 38-28 victory over Southern Methodist and end the Golden Hurricane’s six-game losing streak. Evans went 16 of 24 for 286 yards. LUKE FALK The redshirt freshman quarterback made his first start and threw for 471 yards and five touchdowns as visiting Washington State ended a four-game losing streak with a 39-32 victory over Oregon State. GRANT HEDRICK The redshirt senior quarterback threw for four touchdowns and rushed for two to help visiting Boise State overcome two first-half, 14-point deficits in a 60-49 victory over New Mexico. Hedrick finished with 367 yards passing and 131 on the ground.  News and Notes QUARTERBACK SETS MARKGarrett Grayson threw four touchdown passes, breaking Colorado State’s single-season record of 23, and the host Rams (9-1, 5-1 Mountain West Conference) routed Hawaii, 49-22. The Warriors (2-8, 1-4) fell to their 17th straight road loss. Grayson, who threw for 278 yards, completing 13 of 24 passes, entered the game with 22 touchdown throws. Grayson tied the team record he shared last year with Justin Holland (2005) when he hit Elroy Masters Jr. from 8 yards out. Grayson broke the record with a 52-yarder to Charles Lovett later in the first quarter. He also hit tight end Steven Walker with a 30-yard scoring throw. A RARE VICTORY Michael Cummings threw for 278 yards and accounted for two touchdowns, Corey Avery ran for 103 yards and another score, and host Kansas (3-6, 1-5 Big 12) beat up Iowa State (2-7, 0-6), 34-14, for just its second Big 12 win in the past four years. SEAL TAKES THE FIELD Tom Hruby, a 33-year-old active Navy SEAL, made his debut for host Northwestern against Michigan. A junior who walked on this season as a defensive end, Hruby was in on the game’s opening kickoff. Married and a father of three, he was recently cleared to play by the Navy. The Wolverines (5-5, 3-3 Big Ten) beat the Wildcats (3-6, 2-4), 10-9, when Northwestern quarterback Trevor Siemian slipped during a late 2-point conversion attempt. EX-NORTH CAROLINA PLAYER FILES SUIT The former North Carolina football player Michael McAdoo filed a lawsuit against the university, saying it had failed to provide him and other athletes a quality education when it guided them toward sham classes. Online court records said a lawsuit seeking class-action status had been filed in United States District Court in Charlotte. McAdoo, a defensive lineman who played for the Tar Heels from 2008 through 2010, was ruled permanently ineligible in 2010 for academic violations connected to a tutor’s improper assistance on a research paper.
