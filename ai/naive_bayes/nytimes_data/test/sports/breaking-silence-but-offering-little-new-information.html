Breaking Silence, But Offering Little 
Roger Goodell emerged in public on Friday, but in his news conference he offered little in the way of enlightenment or information.

Maybe Commissioner  His 44-minute press conference on Friday He did not seem ready for all the questions even as he felt he had something to say to journalists who were clamoring for him to speak up. It is tempting to compare Goodell’s performance to that of N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver when he outlined his strong punishment of Donald Sterling, the former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers. Silver was passionate and angry at a specific target: Sterling’s racism, which struck at the core of the league. Goodell made himself a target with his apologies for mishandling the Ray Rice case. But he could not summon the sort of angst and fire Silver displayed when he talked about being “personally distraught” over Sterling’s statements. More important was the inadequacy of some of Goodell’s answers. He did not respond directly to a question about why there was no electronic evidence of a request to the Atlantic City authorities for the second video that showed Rice punching his future wife, Janay Palmer, in a casino elevator. Goodell suggested that the reason he should not resign as commissioner was that he had acknowledged his mistake and was moving forward. He danced inelegantly around a question about what Rice had said to him in their meeting that was inconsistent with Rice’s account of assaulting Palmer, then his fiancée. Then, as a coda that should have substituted for any comments, he said he did not want to prejudge Rice’s appeal of his indefinite suspension. But if he did not want to prejudge any issues, why did he unambiguously say “yes” when asked if he still believed no one in his office had the second, more incendiary video from inside the elevator? That matter is part of the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, a former director of the F.B.I., into the league’s actions in the Rice case. Goodell seemed to feel that flaying himself verbally was a way to avoid questions. Asked how many difficult conversations he had with N.F.L. sponsors, he expressed disappointment in himself, but never gave a direct answer. He avoided a follow-up question about whether the league had come close to losing a sponsor, and told the reporter to speak to the sponsors. Goodell can be credited for his new domestic violence initiatives and for conceding that when he talked to Rice and his wife, he should have used the law enforcement protocol of speaking with them separately. But a devoted viewer of “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” could have advised him of that. Goodell, who stood before a blue backdrop festooned with 10 N.F.L. shields, came armed with inaccurate legal information about Greg Hardy, the Carolina Panthers defensive end who was convicted in July of assaulting and threatening his girlfriend. “He was convicted and then what happens when he appeals that, it is wiped out until he goes to a jury trial,” Goodell said, adding: “There was a conviction. It gets removed until the jury trial.” Not true. Daniel C. Richman, a professor at Columbia Law School, said, “Convictions are taken as authoritative legal facts until and unless they are overturned.” A county court judge found Hardy guilty and sentenced him to 18 months’ probation. The sentence is stayed pending his appeal, which will be heard by a jury. And in lauding Mueller, Goodell called him the “longest-serving” F.B.I. director. Mueller served for a dozen years, but somebody named J. Edgar Hoover held the position for 48.
