Decline in Value of Canadian Dollar Could Affect N.H.L. Salary Cap
The decline in the value of the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar could have an impact on the size of an increase, if any, in the N.H.L.’s salary cap next season.

The N.H.L.'s general managers count on the salary cap to rise every year. But what if, as some fear, it does not go up next season? The defending champion Los Angeles Kings might not have the cap space to retain Justin Williams, scorer of more Game 7 points than anyone else in league history. The Boston Bruins might have to part with Dougie Hamilton, Torey Krug or another of their defensemen of the future. The Rangers would have to make some hard decisions about Martin St. Louis, Derek Stepan, Mats Zuccarello, Carl Hagelin and Marc Staal, who all become free agents next summer. The reason for all this trepidation? The falling Canadian dollar. But league officials say the speculation is overblown. “I expect there to be a healthy rise in the salary cap for next season,” Bill Daly, the deputy commissioner, said last week. “The Canadian dollar would have to continue to fall in a material way for that to change.” For the N.H.L., a strong Canadian dollar means strong business growth. But with the Canadian dollar skidding, speculation is rife that the league’s bottom line may suffer, triggering a cascade of side effects, including a stagnant salary cap for the 2015-16 season. Next season’s salary cap is certain to be a main topic of discussion when the N.H.L.'s Board of Governors meets Dec. 8 and 9 in Boca Raton, Fla. The salary cap is tied to league revenue. When the Canadian dollar falls, the portion of league revenue generated by the N.H.L.'s seven Canadian teams diminishes as well. That affects the salary cap. “It’s like throwing a dart at a dartboard — you make your best guess,” said Cyril Leeder, president of the Ottawa Senators. “We’ll be making contingency plans for if the cap goes up, cap stays the same, cap comes down. The league will advise us throughout the year.” The salary cap has climbed steadily every non-lockout year since it was instituted for 2005-6, and general managers have come to count on that rise when they sign players. This season the cap is at $69 million per team. Early forecasts predicted it to increase to $74 million for next season, but that may prove optimistic. The Canadian dollar, which matched the American dollar as recently as February 2013, now trades at just over 88 cents. A Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce report issued in September estimated that the loonie (so called because it is engraved with an image of a loon) will fall below 85 cents. How can the state of the Canadian dollar affect the fiscal health of United States hockey clubs? “Canadian teams earn in Canadian dollars but pay their players in American dollars, so in U.S. dollar terms they’ve lost more than 10 percent of their revenues from a year and a half ago,” said Glen Hodgson, chief economist of the research group The  Even though Canadian teams make up only 23 percent of the N.H.L., by most estimates they contribute about 35 percent of revenue. “So there clearly has to be an effect on overall revenue for the league, on the salary cap, on revenue sharing,” Hodgson said. Last season, Commissioner  Even the bulk of the league’s television money comes from Canada. But Rogers Communications’ 12-year, $5.2 billion broadcast deal is paid in Canadian dollars, so while that contract was worth $4.9 billion in United States dollars when it was signed a year ago, it is worth $4.6 billion today. A weaker Canadian dollar could have other side effects. If the league expands or existing teams in Florida or Arizona move, a faltering loonie could hurt Quebec City’s bid to land a franchise since, as a small Canadian city, it would contribute less revenue to the N.H.L. If Quebec City’s chances diminish, the odds improve for Seattle and Las Vegas. Still, an 88-cent loonie is a far cry from the mid-1990s, when it traded below 75 cents and was a major factor in moves to the United States by Quebec’s previous team, the Nordiques, and the original Winnipeg Jets. The currency continued to plunge, hitting a low of 62 cents in 2002. That period, from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, was not a good one for the N.H.L. Franchise shifts, negligible television revenue and shrinking visibility in the United States were some of the biggest problems confronting the league. After 2005, the  That was only one factor, others being the creation of the Winter Classic; Stanley Cups in Detroit, Pittsburgh, Chicago and Boston; N.H.L. participation at the Winter Olympics; cost certainty for owners after two lockouts; and lucrative television contracts on both sides of the border. But the influence of a stronger Canadian dollar is unmistakable. It is reflected in  In 2002, the average Canadian-based team ranked 21st in value out of the league’s 30 franchises. In 2013, the average Canadian team’s value had risen to ninth. Despite the loonie’s recent drop, the Forbes list released last Tuesday still puts the average Canadian team’s value at 10th. Daly agrees that a stronger Canadian dollar helps the N.H.L. as a whole. “The league is obviously healthier when the dollars are closer to par,” he said. “But I think the business success of the league and the clubs over the last several years stands on its own.” Hodgson and other Canadian economists say the loonie would have to drop well below 85 cents to have a significant impact on the N.H.L.'s nearly $4 billion-a-year business. But, as Bettman has noted, the league watches the exchange rates every day. Its financial health depends on it.
