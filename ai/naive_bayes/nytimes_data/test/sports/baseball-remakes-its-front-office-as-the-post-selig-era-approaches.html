Baseball Remakes Its Front Office as the Post-Selig Era Approaches
With the impending departure of Commissioner Bud Selig, Major League Baseball revamped its front office on Thursday.

Rob Manfred, who will take over as commissioner for  Bob Bowman, the president of MLB Advanced Media, baseball’s lucrative Internet division, was named M.L.B.’s president of business and media. He will apparently take on the revenue-generating portfolio held by Tim Brosnan, whose resignation as executive vice president of business was announced this week. Brosnan was a finalist for the commissioner’s job but withdrew before voting began. Bowman will continue to run the advanced media operation and will add oversight of MLB Network. Tony Petitti, the longtime president of MLB Network, will replace Manfred as chief operating officer. Jonathan Mariner, baseball’s chief financial officer, will become the chief investment officer, while Bob Starkey, a longtime economic consultant to Selig, will replace Mariner. Dan Halem will move from executive vice president of labor relations to chief labor officer, and Joe Torre will become chief baseball officer, shedding the title of executive vice president. Pat Courtney, the senior vice president of public relations, was named chief communications officer. WRIGLEY CHANGES APPROVED  Cubs officials went before the panel Thursday for approval of a plan to move some of the outfield ad signage for which the team won city approval in July. The changes include eliminating a 650-foot sign in left field and swapping the locations of a video board and a 650-foot sign in right field. The right-field video board would be smaller. The left-field video board would move closer to the center-field scoreboard. The Cubs could receive up to $75 million in tax credits. Wrigley Field is undergoing a privately financed $575 million renovation.  IBANEZ OPTS OUT  Ibanez was one of three finalists for the job, along with Kevin Cash and Don Wakamatsu.  GIANTS MAKE TWO DEALS  First baseman/outfielder Travis Ishikawa agreed to a one-year, $1.1 million deal with the Giants,  KOHN SIGNS WITH BRAVES  Kohn, 28, was 2-1 with a 3.04 earned run average in 25 relief appearances with the Los Angeles Angels last season. He missed the 2012 season after Tommy John surgery.  LEWIS STAYS IN TEXAS  Lewis, 35, was 10-14 with a 5.18 E.R.A. in 29 starts last season, and pitched a team-high 1701/3 innings. He had a 3.86 E.R.A. with two complete games in his last 13 starts after the All-Star break last summer.
