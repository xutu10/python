Storming From Behind, Ligety Claims a Timely Victory
With a bold second run, the American Ted Ligety won the giant slalom at Beaver Creek, where the world championships will be held in two months.

BEAVER CREEK, Colo. —  It was as if part of the ski racing world had been turned upside down. Ted Ligety, a five-time World Cup giant slalom champion and the defending Olympic gold medalist in the event, had finished 10th in the opening giant slalom of the season. A month later, he smashed his left hand so violently with a blunder in training that it took four screws to put the bones back together. In three subsequent races, he did not improve on his 10th place in that first race. Finally, after the first run on Sunday in the giant slalom at Beaver Creek, where Ligety had won four of the last five times, he was in fourth place with one run remaining. Ligety, 30, is American ski racing’s most reliable star. With the world championships coming to Beaver Creek in February — its first time in the United States in 15 years — ski racing fans in the United States were increasingly concerned that the trustworthy Ligety might be having an untimely off year. Then Ligety pushed out of the gate at the top of the Beaver Creek racecourse for his second run Sunday. As he has done so many times, Ligety roared from behind with a daring and dauntless ride to overwhelm the field and claim a victory that ought to assuage worries on the home front. Moreover, his fifth first-place finish here restored Ligety as a favorite to defend his world championship giant slalom title. “I didn’t win by as much as usual, so maybe it’s not as big a statement victory,” said Ligety, whose combined winning time of 2 minutes 34.07 seconds was 0.18 of a second ahead of the second-place finisher, Alexis Pinturault of France, and 0.60 better than Austria’s Marcel Hirscher, who was third. “But it helps my confidence on a racecourse I know very well. Hopefully, I can continue the win streak in February.” Sunday was also a good day for one of the most renowned American female ski racers. At the Lake Louise resort in Alberta, Lindsey Vonn followed her downhill victory Saturday with a second-place finish in super-G, behind Switzerland’s Lara Gut. “My timing wasn’t always great and I was a little late on some turns,” Vonn said of her performance Sunday. “But for all the mistakes I’ve made, I’m exceptionally happy with second place.” For Vonn, who is recovering from two complex knee operations, Sunday was just her third race in roughly a year. “For the lack of training I’ve had, it’s been a phenomenal weekend,” Vonn said. Gut, the bronze medalist in downhill at the Sochi Olympics, defended her Lake Louise super-G title from 2013 by finishing 0.37 of a second ahead of Vonn in 1:18.46. Tina Maze of Slovenia, the World Cup overall points leader, was third, 0.44 of a second behind Vonn. For Ligety, it was a 23rd World Cup giant slalom victory, tying him for second in career wins with Michael von Grünigen of Switzerland. “It’s pretty surreal for me to be tied with von Grünigen,” Ligety said. “Growing up in Park City, I remember watching him ski in the World Cup races there. He was one of my childhood heroes.” To win Sunday, Ligety had to outperform some of the most celebrated skiers of his era. Benjamin Raich, who has 14 Olympic and world championship medals, led the first run, with a 0.25 advantage over Ligety. Pinturault, the bronze medalist in the event at Sochi, was in second, a hundredth of a second behind Raich. Hirscher, the three-time World Cup overall winner, was third, a hundredth of a second ahead of Ligety. “I knew I’d have to really gun it, but I also knew I had a pretty mediocre first run, so I was sure I could make up the time if I relaxed and skied the hill like I knew I could,” Ligety said. It still took a confident aggressiveness, which might have been hard to muster in light of his disappointing performance in the season’s first giant slalom, in Sölden, Austria. But Ligety chalked up the Sölden result to bad luck — during one run he hit a rock and lost an edge on one ski. And the hand injury has not been a major impediment, he said. “My hand hurts, but I never think of it when I’m racing,” Ligety said. “The screws are in good spots. They’ll come out after the season.” First, there will be a date back on the giant slalom racecourse at Beaver Creek in February. “We don’t get that many chances to have a major race in the U.S.,” Ligety said. “So it’s going to be big. I’m glad my most recent memory here is going to be a good one.”
