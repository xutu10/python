A Fan Visits From Afar, and the Royals Come Alive
Lee Sung-woo, an avid Royals fan from South Korea, arrived last week for his first visit to Kansas City; since then, the team has lavished him with attention — and has won seven of eight games.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. —  How do I begin this story? How can I convince you that the greatest story for  I first became aware of Lee Sung-woo eight or nine years ago. I didn’t know his name; I just knew there was someone with the handle KoreanFan who posted on a site named Royals Corner. He wrote as if English was his second language, and he was eternally optimistic at a time when 70-victory seasons were something the Royals could only aspire to. I thought it was impressive that someone from South Korea followed the Royals, but didn’t think too much more of it. Years later, KoreanFan joined Twitter as @Koreanfan_KC. And slowly, through osmosis, I picked up his general story: Lee had become a Royals fan in the 1990s after he saw a highlight on satellite television of the former first baseman Jeff King hitting a home run and was impressed by the beauty of Kauffman Stadium. He stuck loyally with the Royals even though he had no connection to the club or the city whatsoever — he had never set foot in America — and even though the team had just one winning season in his first 17 years as a fan. He stuck with the team even though in the early years he almost never saw them play — before Major League Baseball’s Extra Innings television package, before  Over time, he became a well-known and welcome part of the Royals’ social media community. He would frequently post to Twitter during Royals games even though it was the middle of the night in Korea. His devotion to the team, despite the vast geographic and cultural gap, earned him respect, as did the fact that he never criticized the team or the team’s critics. In one memorable exchange two years ago, pitcher Danny Duffy offered to fly Lee to Kansas City to see the team play. Chris Kamler, who posts on Twitter as @TheFakeNed,  This summer, Lee, 38, finally took the plunge. Taking advantage of a change to a new job as a merchandise manager, he took 10 days to visit Kansas City, watch the Royals play and maybe do a little sightseeing and eat some barbecue. He emailed Kamler and another Royals fan, Dave Darby, about his plans; they told him they would pick him up and drive him to the ballpark and show him around town. If the story had ended there, it would have been enough: three people who have never met, and can barely communicate with one another, bonding like long-lost friends over a shared interest in a long-frustrated baseball team. Movies have been made with flimsier plots. But Kamler decided to publicize the fact that Lee was finally coming to Kansas City. He had no idea what he was getting himself into. None of us did. To their credit, the Royals themselves then quickly got involved. The team contacted Lee directly and invited him to throw out a first pitch at a game. Coming from an organization that has made missteps with the way it communicates with its fan base at times, this was a classy move. The news media, the fans, the entire city took the hook. By the time Lee landed in Kansas City a week ago Tuesday afternoon, there were four local television crews waiting at the gate for his arrival. The city has laid out the red carpet for him ever since, and the story just continues to grow. Deadspin As the week progressed, the team gave him a personal tour of Kauffman Stadium and presented him with a Royals jersey bearing his name and No. 23. Not to be outdone, the Chiefs also gave him a personalized jersey and tickets to a preseason game. He took a side trip Friday to the Royals’ Class AA affiliate in northwest Arkansas, where the team opened the clubhouse and he was able to shake hands with every player. He ended up on the  I managed to speak with him by phone last Saturday before he actually headed to Kaufmann Stadium to see his first game in person; I’m pretty sure I was more nervous than he was. He told me that he and his brother, Sung-jin, who is also a Royals fan, used to read my blog and argue about the Royals afterward. After we spoke, he had to take another phone call —  After Saturday’s game, he was featured on ESPN’s “SportsCenter.” On Sunday, he sat in the studio for the Royals’ pregame television show. On Monday, the Jackson County Commission gave him a commendation, presented by the Royals Hall of Famer Frank White. That night, he received an ovation before throwing out the first pitch, and another when he pinned the W on the scoreboard after the game. So, you know, just like your summer vacation. If this story were just about how Kansas City had opened its homes and its heart to a Royals fan from South Korea, that would be enough. But of course, that’s only half of the story. Because the other half is that ever since Lee arrived in Kansas City, the Royals can’t stop winning. They were already on a hot stretch before he arrived, having won nine of their previous 12 games. But since he got here, the Royals have taken that to another level. There was the game last week against the Arizona Diamondbacks, which the Royals won, 12-2, hitting three homers with at least two men on base for only the fifth time in franchise history. The fifth inning of that game marked the first time the Royals had ever had a three-run homer and a grand slam in the same inning. And then came last Saturday, with Lee in attendance for the first time. The game, against the San Francisco Giants, was scoreless in the middle of the fifth inning, which is when the Royals put Lee’s picture on the Jumbotron. The very next batter — Alex Gordon, leading off the bottom of the fifth — homered. The Royals went on to win, 5-0, as James Shields threw the Royals’ first shutout of the year. Before the game, Lee had sent  The Royals also beat the Giants on Sunday, 7-4, with Lee’s patron, Duffy, getting his second win since Lee’s arrival, and that after Duffy hadn’t won a game since June. And Monday, when Lee held that W aloft, the Royals hadn’t just won their eighth game in a row; they had moved into first place in the American League Central, the latest they have been in first place since 2003. Maybe it’s just a coincidence that one of the Royals’ greatest weeks on the field in a generation just happened to coincide with one of the Royals’ greatest stories off the field in a generation. But I’m just about ready to take leave of reason when it comes to these Royals. You see, Lee Sung-woo has done something even more improbable than spreading Korean pixie dust all over the organization: He’s made me want to believe again.
