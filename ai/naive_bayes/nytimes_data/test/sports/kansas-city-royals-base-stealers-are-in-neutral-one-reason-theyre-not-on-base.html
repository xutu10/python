Royals’ Base Stealers Are in Neutral. One Reason: They’re Not on Base.
Kansas City, which led the major leagues in stolen bases the past two seasons, had just one steal in the first four games of the World Series as its on-base percentage plummeted.

SAN FRANCISCO —  Jarrod Dyson, the speedy outfielder of the  Dyson did not, though, and was erased when Nori Aoki hit into a double play. It was another example of how the Royals had cut down on their base stealing since the regular season and, most visibly, since the American League wild-card game against the Oakland Athletics, when Kansas City’s speed was considered one of its primary weapons. The Royals led the major leagues in stolen bases the past two seasons, with 153 each year. That speed did not always translate to productive offense, though: The Royals ranked ninth in the American League this season in runs scored, with 651. During the regular season, they averaged just under one stolen base a game, but in the World Series, their steal rate has plummeted. The Giants have done a good job of shutting down Kansas City’s speedy runners and keeping the Royals off the bases in general. The Royals stole only one base in the first four games against the Giants — by Alex Gordon in Game 4. Buster Posey, the San Francisco catcher, could have nabbed Gordon, but his throw tailed into Gordon’s shoulder and bounced into center field. Alcides Escobar, the only other Royal to try to steal in the first four games, was thrown out. The Royals put on a memorable display in the wild-card game, stealing seven bases in a comeback victory, but they did most of that against an injured backup catcher. Part of their problem in the World Series was that their on-base percentage in the first four games was only .281, compared with .314 in the regular season. It is difficult to steal bases when you cannot reach base. Also, the Giants’ pitchers, like the Baltimore Orioles’ pitchers in the A.L. Championship Series, have done a good job of making the Royals wary of running. A closer look at Dyson’s situation in Game 4 revealed that reliever Yusmeiro Petit waited a long time before throwing the first pitch to Aoki. That made Dyson unsure of his timing. The first pitch was a ball, so Dyson had good reason to think that the next pitch would be a fastball, not a good pitch on which to steal. ROUTINE OF THEIR OWN “We do it to try to keep the players on a normal routine,” Manager Bruce Bochy said before Sunday’s game. “It’s simple. The guys like it. They seem to prefer it now that they’ve been doing it. They get to sleep in their own bed tonight.” ALL IN, ALMOST Ned Yost, the Royals’ manager, was in Kratz’s position for the Milwaukee Brewers in the 1982 World Series. He played only in Game 6, catching Doc Medich and Dwight Bernard in the final two innings of a 13-1 loss on a rainy night in St. Louis. The Cardinals won the series the next night. Yost came to bat with two outs in the top of the ninth against John Stuper. He still can hardly believe what happened. “I was going to hit a home run,” Yost said, as he watched the Royals take batting practice from the bench before Game 5. “I was going for the homer or striking out, one of the two. I ended up walking — and I never walked.” The experience taught Yost — who walked only 21 times in his 640 other career plate appearances — a lesson he has tried to pass on to his players. Despite the stage, he has told them, the World Series is the same game that they have played all their lives. “I didn’t know what to expect,” he said. “I thought when you played in the World Series, it would be like this magical, wonderful feeling when you got in the game, and I walked out of the dugout, waiting for this magical experience to hit. Then I got out to home plate, squatted down, waited for this magical feeling, and the pitcher threw the first pitch and I thought: ‘Dadgum, I’ve been doing this my whole life. It’s a baseball game.’ ” As for trying to give all his players a taste of the World Series, Yost said it was not a goal — which was probably bad news for Kratz, although a ring could make up for any disappointment. “Just trying to win the game,” Yost said. “If we get everybody in, that’s great. If we can’t, we can’t. We’re just trying to win a world championship for our fans.”
