Danny Willett charged past Luke Donald with a final-round 66 to win the Nedbank Golf Challenge by four shots in Sun City, South Africa. Willett claimed his second European Tour title ahead of Ross Fisher (68), while Donald, the overnight leader, slipped to third in an all-English top three. Willett had an impressive amateur career but had won just once on the tour — at the BMW International in 2012 — before Sunday. Willet made six birdies and no bogeys on the final day to finish with rounds of 65 and 66 during the weekend for an 18-under-par total of 270 at Gary Player Country Club. The formerly top-ranked Donald, seeking a first title in more than a year, ended with a 73 and finished six shots behind Willett.
