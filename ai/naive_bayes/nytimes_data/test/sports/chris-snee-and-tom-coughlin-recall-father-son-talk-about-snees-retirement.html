Chris Snee and Tom Coughlin Recall Father-Son Talk About Snee’s Retirement
When Chris Snee visited Coach Tom Coughlin last summer to talk about retiring from football, the coach saw the father of his three grandchildren, not a Pro Bowl lineman.
===
In July,  For a decade, theirs had been one of the most curious, intriguing and rare relationships in American sports. Coughlin, an old-school disciplinarian, cut a classic paternal figure in athletics. Snee, raised in a working-class central Pennsylvania household and married to Coughlin’s daughter Kate, was a quiet, pensive supporting cog in the vast, systematic mechanism of the N.F.L., grappling at a violent, dangerous job to make a name for himself and please his coach. But more than 150 N.F.L. games had taken their toll on Snee’s 315-pound body, a football creation painstakingly sculptured with marathon weight lifting sessions, timely medicinal restorations and intense, year-round training. Various body parts were now failing him, making a walk down the stairs unpredictable and hazardous. Just sitting upright in a chair was sometimes an uncomfortable challenge. Coughlin, meanwhile, had just endured one of his most disappointing seasons as a coach, and he was counting on Snee to help lead the Giants’ resurrection this season. The intricate and much observed Snee-Coughlin connection was reaching a crossroads. It would soon become substantially more complex and poignant. A player was confronting his football mortality, and the coach, programmed for years to push his players, faced the need to temper those duties with his responsibilities as a father-in-law and the grandfather to Snee’s three children. It began on vacation last summer. By then, Snee was a four-time Pro Bowl selection, an indomitable veteran and a respected anchor of Coughlin’s two Super Bowl-winning teams. But in 2013 Snee had missed almost the entire season with injuries. Slamming into an opponent in the season-opening game, he heard a piece of bone crack and then break loose in his right elbow. He remained in the game. Two games later, Snee’s right hip kept noisily popping in and out of its socket as he assumed his stance at the line of scrimmage. In excruciating pain, Snee finished the game, but shortly thereafter, the Giants announced that he was done for the year. Undeterred, Snee plotted a comeback in 2014. He had off-season hip surgery, the second of his career, and a third operation on his right elbow. Medical procedures prolonging Snee’s football career had long ago become a routine part of his life, whether it was epidurals for bulging disks in his back, cortisone shots delivered with foot-long needles, lubricant injected into cranky joints, fluid drained to relieve inflammation or arthroscopic surgery to slice out damaged cartilage. In the phone in his pocket, Snee carried a picture of a dinner plate filled with the bone fragments excised from his right elbow. It was one of the reasons Snee could no longer straighten the elbow. Still, on vacation in Georgia, Snee was days away from the start of Giants training camp and the resumption of his career. Playing golf with Coughlin’s extended family, Snee swung a club and recoiled from a stabbing pain that filled his right arm. “I had to drop the driver,” Snee said in one of a series of lengthy interviews in the last two months. “No one said anything, but we sort of looked at each other — everyone knew what was going on. My body was giving out on me; it couldn’t take it anymore.” Returning home a few days later, Snee waited for a Saturday when he knew the Giants’ corporate headquarters in New Jersey would be quiet so he could privately visit his father-in-law in his office. “I knew what he was coming to say,” Coughlin said last week, recalling the scene five months ago. “It was going to be very hard on both of us.” For 10 years, the sports community had been fixated on the uncommon Snee-Coughlin relationship, but in most cases, the two men had made it seem a seamless, undramatic union. But behind the scenes over the years, the coach had acted like a father-in-law when he observed Snee limping in practice or wincing as he grabbed his arm. Coughlin would approach to ask: Are you O.K.? “I always answered that I was fine,” Snee, 32, said. “I felt like the last thing a coach wants to hear is your troubles. He has enough on his plate without worrying that the right guard isn’t 100 percent.” Coughlin’s wife, Judy, would sometimes hear from her husband that Snee might be injured and she would also corner her son-in-law: How are you doing? “Chris’s answer was always, ‘I’m great,'” Judy Coughlin said. “You weren’t getting anything out of him.” Snee’s wife would notice the infirmities as well. “The first couple of years in the league, the day after a game he would be absolutely fine,” Kate Snee said Wednesday. “Five years after that, he wouldn’t feel good for a couple of days afterward. Ten years in, he’d be miserable for a full week. We talked about it all the time, and I raised all the pros and cons of what he was doing. “I wanted him to feel well, not just play well.” Snee’s response was to adhere to the offensive lineman’s credo: Injuries were masked and asking out of the lineup was verboten. “I think Kate knew how meaningful and important it was for me to be in uniform and accountable to my teammates,” Snee said. “So, to me, I still think I was giving the right answers.” But the operations on his hip and elbow in 2013 had not brought the recovery that Snee had been expecting. Snee was accustomed to lifting excessively heavy weights four or five hours a day, slogging through sweat-soaked workouts at the Giants’ workout complex in the morning and then spending the afternoon with an Olympic-level powerlifting guru in another New Jersey gym. Years ago, Men’s Journal magazine suggested that Snee might be the strongest man in the N.F.L. But last summer the barbells Snee thrust over his head held only a fraction of the weight they once did. During his most recent elbow surgery, doctors sliced open his right arm from the biceps to the wrist to relocate a nerve. But his right arm remained weak and partially numb. Moreover, even light off-season running workouts were making his hips — both had been operated on — ache and throb. “I had to be honest with myself,” Snee said. “But that didn’t make it any easier as I was walking into Coach Coughlin’s office.” The two had met in the office many times before. But now was different. With the Giants’ offensive line in shambles, Coughlin desperately needed Snee to help bolster a young team coming off a dismal 7-9 season. Snee was an inspirational presence who led by example, always among the first players to arrive each day and one of the last to leave. Coughlin cherished Snee’s lunch-bucket mentality and called him “the most reliable person to ever put on a Giants uniform.” Snee once started 108 games in a row. But this time, Coughlin looked at Snee and saw the father of three of his grandchildren, not a durable Pro Bowl guard. “I sat him down and I told him I loved him,” Coughlin said. “I said to him: ‘You are a very, very important part of my family. I want you to think of your future.’ “We both knew what the decision was. But it was a very emotional time in my office. He said he had been thinking about being able to play in the backyard with his sons. He didn’t want football to rob him of that.” Finally, Snee rose to his feet and left the office. In a hallway, Snee was reunited with his 8-year-old son, Cooper, who had come along for the trip. Seeing his father in tears, Cooper wondered what had happened during the conversation with his grandfather. “I told Cooper I wasn’t going to play football anymore — never again,” Snee said. “And Cooper looked at me and said: ‘That’s O.K. Now you can play with me more.'” In the last several months, Snee has played more often with Cooper and his brothers, Dylan, 11, and Walker, 4. He is coaching their teams in various sports and he has volunteered his time as a coach at a high school near his northern New Jersey home. Snee has lost more than 55 pounds since July. “To keep my weight over 300 pounds, I basically had to eat something bad for me all the time,” Snee said. “I’d eat a double portion of dinner and then a huge bowl of ice cream. I’ve stopped that and the powerlifting workouts, too.” Without the extra weight, Snee’s hips, back and chronically sore knee no longer bother him, although his left hip is arthritic, and he knows it will one day have to be replaced. His right elbow still does not function as it should. “But I’m running two miles several days a week, which would have been impossible six months ago,” Snee said at lunch in a New Jersey restaurant. “I feel more healthy; I have more energy. I was tired before, physically and mentally. The treatments day after day, all the M.R.I.s and the rehab sessions — just never being completely healthy — it wears on you.” When the weather in New Jersey was more favorable this fall, he played golf most days — between shuttling his sons to school. He wrote articles on football for a website and did some commentary on postgame shows. He is far from living in the past. Inside his New Jersey home, there are no trophies or mementos of his Giants career in the family’s main living space. Snee does not struggle to fill his time, and much of the old lunch-bucket offensive lineman mentality remains. “When it snows I still shovel my own driveway even though it’s about 50 yards long,” said Snee, who was raised by a mother who still works full time at a hospital and a father who labors 15 hours a day in the summer as a cement mix truck driver. Snee is also trying to persuade his wife to let him mow the large lawn surrounding the family homestead instead of having landscapers do it. “It’s been wonderful to have Chris around for all the things he missed before,” Kate Snee said. “He came to our 4-year-old’s school Christmas concert the other day. He had never been to one.” Kate and Chris met as students at Boston College. One night, her father, who was then the coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, was in Boston scouting another Boston College player. He called Kate and suggested they have dinner. “Kate asked me if she could bring a friend,” Coughlin recalled. “I said sure. That afternoon I was watching tape of this other B.C. player, and I couldn’t help but notice this guard who was knocking people over and clearing out huge holes to run through. “His name was Snee. I go to dinner that night and Kate’s guest is the same guy, Chris Snee. And he didn’t say two words throughout the whole dinner.” Shortly after  “No one should feel sorry for me,” Snee said. “I got 10 great years in my dream job. This is what I wanted to do. A lot of players never get to have any career. My boys celebrated on the field with me for two Super Bowls. “I wouldn’t change anything I did. I knew when I signed up for the game that I would be sore and feel it later on in my life. But I’ve taken so much out of the game, and not just financial rewards. It has been an invaluable experience to me.” Snee’s last contract, signed in 2008, was worth more than $40 million. But it is not entirely true that Snee has no regrets. “It bugs me that I didn’t finish healthy and playing well,” Snee said. “I didn’t see the breakdowns coming. Five years ago, I thought I was going to play 10 more years.” One of Snee’s closest friends on the Giants was quarterback Eli Manning, who is far more perspicacious than his purposely bland public persona lets on. Manning, who has started 165 consecutive regular-season games, said every player fools himself into thinking his career will carry on uninterrupted. “We always tell each other, ‘Play each game like it’s your last because it might be,'” Manning said last week. “But I don’t know if we ever believe that. You think you’ll always be able to keep going. We all make a plan to play a certain number of years.” But, he added, “The N.F.L. has other plans.” Shaun O’Hara, who retired from the N.F.L. in 2010, lives near Snee and has remained in contact with his former linemate. “Chris is that guy who never lets anyone down,” O’Hara said. “So it killed him to leave a team that needed him. But when your body is breaking down, you start to realize the damage that is being done and you know some of it is irreparable. “You get to the point where you say — is it worth it?” Unlike other pro football players, Snee sustained only one concussion. He sat out two weeks. Snee is well aware of the drumbeat of former N.F.L. players coming forward in middle age with health concerns, including dementia and cognitive disabilities. Asked if he was worried about his future well-being, Snee answered: “I certainly haven’t been thinking about it, and my feeling is that I’ll be fine. I’m going to apply the same mind-set I had for 10 years: one day at a time. I feel good, and I’m doing the right things for myself — that’s what I’m focused on.” Although Snee graduated from Boston College with an accounting degree, he does not expect his college major to influence his next vocational choice. He is instead looking into coaching football at a high school on a more full-time basis next season. “If he’s a coach, those kids will learn how to be a good teammate,” Manning said. “Chris never said much. He was just there for you whenever you needed him.” Tom Coughlin has not counseled Snee about coaching. “Frankly, I think he could do whatever he wants — Wall Street, whatever — and succeed,” Coughlin said. “He’s that smart.” The coach and the player, the father-in-law and the son-in-law, do not spend the time together that they once did. “It bothers me that I don’t see him every day because seeing him always gave me confidence,” Coughlin said. “But he made the right decision. And it makes me appreciate those 10 years.” Snee’s acclimation to being a former player has been smooth, with one major exception: game days. “If I go to a game, before kickoff I get goose bumps and feel that edgy nervousness just like I did when I was playing,” he said. “My body fully expects that I’m going to run onto that field, and that’s hard.” But the nights after games are easier. “I never slept after a game,” Snee said. “If we won, I’d stay up all night rehashing things, and if we lost, then Sunday night would be my time to grieve.” He added, “Now I sleep.” It may be an allegory for a life after pro football. “My time right now is peaceful,” Snee said. “I’ve had stress for the last how many years? I’m not pushing myself now. I want one fall where I just look back and enjoy what I’ve done. “At some point, I’ll just take it from there.”
