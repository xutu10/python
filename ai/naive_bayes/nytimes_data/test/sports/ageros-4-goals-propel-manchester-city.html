Southampton crushed visiting Sunderland, 8-0, in one of the biggest wins in the Premier League’s 22-year history, overshadowing Sergio Agüero’s four-goal haul in Manchester City’s thrashing of Tottenham on Saturday. On an incident-packed day of goals, red cards and drama in England’s top league, Chelsea preserved its 5-point lead — and its unbeaten start to the season — by beating host Crystal Palace, 2-1, thanks to a free kick from Oscar and a great team goal finished off by Cesc Fàbregas. Second-place City, the defending champion, is leading the chase, with Agüero grabbing two goals in each half — two coming from penalties — and also missing from the spot in a 4-1 win at home over the 10-man Spurs. City has now scored 15 goals in three straight wins over Tottenham. Southampton stayed a point behind in third after scoring five times in the final 27 minutes against imploding Sunderland, narrowly missing out on equaling the record margin of victory in the Premier League held by Manchester United in its 9-0 win over Ipswich in 1995. “I’m still a little bit in shock,” Southampton Manager Ronald Koeman said. “Sometimes football is strange.” That victory, Southampton’s biggest in the league, upstaged Agüero’s effervescent attacking display against Tottenham, with his four goals moving him level with Chelsea striker Diego Costa as the Premier League’s top scorer, with nine. Danny Welbeck’s stoppage-time strike secured injury-hit Arsenal a 2-2 draw at home with Hull, and goals by Phil Jagielka, Romelu Lukaku and Seamus Coleman earned host Everton a 3-0 win over Aston Villa. West Ham defeated host Burnley, 3-1, and Newcastle’s match against Leicester was delayed by an hour after part of a newly erected big screen was dislodged by wind at St. James’ Park. RONALDO SETS RECORD Ronaldo has 15 goals in eight games despite missing one game because of injury. Barcelona’s Neymar is in second place with seven goals. Madrid rose provisionally into second place, 1 point behind Barcelona, which was scheduled to host Eibar later in a match where Lionel Messi would need two goals to tie the league’s career record. Athletic Bilbao and visiting Celta Vigo tied, 1-1. DORTMUND’S SLUMP CONTINUES  Stuttgart fought from three goals down to draw, 3-3, with visiting Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Möenchengladbach defeated host Hannover by 3-0, visiting Wolfsburg beat Freiburg by 2-1, and host Mainz beat Augsburg by 2-1.
