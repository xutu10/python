Penguins Shake Off Playoff Failure
The Penguins, ousted by the lower-seeded Rangers in the playoffs last season, are knifing through the regular season again and aiming toward a rematch Tuesday at Madison Square Garden.

If ever there was a prelude for a bad season for the  But here the Penguins are, knifing through the regular season again, as if nothing bad happened, and aiming toward a rematch against the Rangers on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden. “Absolutely the playoffs are the real measure — that’s how you win the championship,” said Jim Rutherford, the Penguins’ new general manager. “But part of that is to play the game the right way with good habits through the regular season. Lots of people say the regular season doesn’t matter. It does matter.” On Saturday night, the Penguins demolished the struggling Buffalo Sabres, 6-1, with Crosby contributing five assists to tie a career high and seize the league scoring lead. The victory extended the Penguins’ winning streak to seven and kept them in a first-place tie atop the Eastern Conference with 21 points. It also increased their league-best goal difference to plus-28. They have killed off 37 straight power plays. At one point during the streak they scored 18 goals without interruption. “I think I’m crazy, but I think we can be a lot better,” Crosby said. “That’s the scary part.” Regular-season excellence is nothing new for the Penguins. The 802 points they accumulated from the 2006-7 season through 2013-14 were the most by any N.H.L. team. Ray Shero was the general manager for all seven of those seasons. Another innovative American, Dan Bylsma, was the coach for the last five and a half. They won the Stanley Cup in 2009. But by the time of the debacle against the Rangers, their message had grown stale. So Pittsburgh hired Rutherford, 65, who spent 20 years as an executive with the Carolina Hurricanes and their predecessor, the Hartford Whalers. Rutherford in turn hired Mike Johnston, a 57-year-old hockey lifer who had never been an N.H.L. head coach. Together these two graybeard Canadians brought a slightly more traditional ethos to the Penguins. “It’s obviously not a big change that needs to take place here,” Rutherford said. “It’s been a terrific organization for a long time, with a lot of top players. So what we’ve looked to do is change the style of play a little bit.” That meant, in part, acquiring Steve Downie, a physical player with three lengthy suspensions in his junior and professional careers. Downie has stepped in on several occasions to stand up for Crosby — something the Penguins noticeably did not do during a playoff game last spring when the Rangers’ Marc Staal repeatedly crosschecked Crosby in the back of the head. But Rutherford and Johnston have also added more flexibility to the Penguins’ game. “This year it’s more puck possession; last year it was more get the puck up the boards as quick as possible and get in on the forecheck,” defenseman Paul Martin said. “It’s a little more fun for us on the back end. Before you had to do it this way; it’s the only way. Now we have more freedom to make our own reads and make the right play.” Advanced statistics suggest that the Penguins are playing over their heads, and will come back to earth. But for now, they are unquestionably soaring. The Penguins’ other superstar, Evgeni Malkin, scored against Buffalo to boost his season total to six goals in 13 games. Patric Hornqvist, acquired from Nashville over the summer for James Neal, scored two goals to bring his total to nine. Chris Kunitz has eight. Defenseman Kris Letang, who missed a large chunk of last season after having a stroke, had two goals and two assists. (Another defenseman, Olli Maatta, missed the Buffalo game after having an operation to remove a tumor from his thyroid gland last but is expected to return within four weeks.) Goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, whose recent postseasons have been marked by flubs and meltdowns, signed a four-year, $23 million contract extension last week. He shares the league lead with three shutouts. Crosby’s poor play against the Rangers last spring turned out to be, in part, the result of an undisclosed wrist injury. Still, he was strongly criticized. But in his three months with the Penguins, Johnston said, he has seen no problem with Crosby’s leadership. “I think he’s done a phenomenal job so far,” Johnston said. “By his work ethic, how he practices, how he plays and certainly with our coaching staff, in the room, talking about the game, he’s 100 percent focused on hockey all the time.” Crosby is taking the current winning streak in stride. He knows that regular seasons are important, but the real test lies in what he and the Penguins do several months from now. “We’ve been in situations like this before,” he said. “As long as we keep that in mind, evaluate ourselves the right way and make sure we keep getting better, hopefully we’ll improve.”
