Veteran Martin St. Louis Welcomes Larger Role With Rangers
Martin St. Louis, the 39-year-old sharpshooter the Rangers acquired in a deadline deal last season, is becoming a role model for his teammates ahead of his first full season in New York.

Much sets Martin St. Louis apart on the ice, starting with his relentless pace and bright yellow Warrior hockey stick. Much sets him apart off the ice, too, including the text message he sent Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault after the team’s top center, Derek Stepan,  St. Louis, a 5-foot-8 right wing known for his left-handed sharpshooting from the right face-off circle, volunteered to shift to center. The move did not surprise Vigneault. “He’s one of the first guys on the ice shooting pucks — hundreds of pucks — and he always stays after practice,” Vigneault said. “He’s like a kid out there. What a role model that is for your whole group, helping everyone become the best they can be. For me as a coach, it makes my job a lot easier.” Stepan will miss at least 10 games, and St. Louis may start the Rangers’ opener at the Blues on Thursday night in Stepan’s place — centering the top line between Rick Nash, who is 6-foot-4, and Chris Kreider, who is 6-3. “I’m looking forward to it,” St. Louis said. “You have to adapt and be versatile. I try to be that.” He knows his first full season with the Rangers comes with heightened expectations. He asked to be traded to the Rangers last season and arrived in exchange for Ryan Callahan in a  “It’s about being honest with your performance,” St. Louis said. “If anyone’s going to be hard on you, it has to start with you. You end up being demanding of yourself with high standards, and I think that’s contagious for the whole team.” St. Louis has 370 career goals and enters the season 19 points shy of 1,000 for his career, which began inauspiciously with the Calgary Flames in 1998-99 after four years at the University of Vermont, where he met his wife, Heather. Signed as a free agent by the Lightning after the Flames bought out his contract in the summer of 2000, St. Louis excelled for nearly 13 seasons in Tampa Bay, which included a Stanley Cup in 2004. He has played his best hockey since turning 30, scoring 25 or more goals every year except the lockout-shortened 48-game season in 2012-13, when his 17 goals and 43 assists led the league in scoring. He was 37, the oldest player to win the Art Ross Trophy. Much of that success is attributable to  “Being normal or average is not in Marty’s DNA,” said Prentiss, who trains dozens of N.H.L. players. “He knows that hard work trumps a lot, and when you combine hard work with skill, then you have your athlete.” When St. Louis arrived in New York late last season, he had a good friend waiting: his former Tampa Bay teammate Brad Richards. Richards  St. Louis played on despite his despair, and his combined leadership with Richards proved instrumental in helping the Rangers reach the finals, where they  Now Richards is with the Chicago Blackhawks,  St. Louis, a father of three sons, skated during training camp with the 19-year-old rookie Anthony Duclair, whose strong play won him a spot on the Rangers’ roster. The opportunity to skate alongside an idol quickly left an imprint on Duclair, a 50-goal scorer for the junior Quebec Remparts last season. “It was dreamlike for me because Marty is one of the guys I’ve looked up to since I was young,” said Duclair, who, like St. Louis, grew up in the Montreal area. “He’s such a determined guy, and he had some good tips for me on the power play. He’s definitely a cool mentor to have.” Named an alternate captain Monday, St. Louis will focus anew on taking younger teammates under his wing and helping the new captain, defenseman Ryan McDonagh, point the squad toward another playoff surge. “We did something special that created many friendships with the guys here, and I’m still building that trust,” St. Louis said. “Every year you have new guys, and you have to create bonds with those guys because it’s not always the best team on paper that wins; it’s the team that can play the best as a team that wins.” St. Louis has one year left on his contract, but he is not thinking of slowing down, citing Jaromir Jagr and Teemu Selanne as his role models. “The way I look at it: When I was a teenager, I looked at older players and said, ‘If they can do it, why can’t I do it?’ ” St. Louis said. “Now I look at Jagr and Selanne — guys who played into their 40s — and I say the same thing: ‘If they can do it, why can’t I?’ ”
