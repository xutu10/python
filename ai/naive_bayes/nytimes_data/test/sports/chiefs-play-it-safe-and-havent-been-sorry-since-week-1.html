Chiefs Play It Safe, and Haven’t Been Sorry Since Week 1
Since losing their first two games, including the opener to the Titans, the Chiefs have used a slow, methodical offense to go 6-1 and outscore opponents by 89 points.

It was the most surprising result of the season. We just didn’t know it at the time. In the summer, Las Vegas oddsmakers pegged the  In Week 2, Kansas City lost a close game at Denver. Since then, the Chiefs are 6-1 and have outscored opponents by 89 points. They are tied with the Indianapolis Colts for the best  It starts with a methodical offense. Kansas City ranks in the top five in time of possession, average plays run per drive and average time per drive. The Chiefs have eight turnovers this year, with three coming in the opening day loss. That means Kansas City has five turnovers in its last eight games, tied with the Patriots for second least in the N.F.L. in that span, one behind Arizona. The Chiefs committed 18 turnovers in 2013, tied for the second fewest in the league, so it’s safe to say that holding on to the ball is a core tenet of the Kansas City offense. An offensive philosophy of long, methodical drives and few turnovers will work only if the team succeeds on third downs, and Kansas City has converted 49 percent of them this year, the third best rate in the league. The team does not have an explosive offense, and no wide receiver has scored a touchdown yet this year. But the offense does the little things right, and can move the chains with the best of them. The “offense” even does well in hidden areas when it does not have the ball: The Chiefs rank in the top quarter of the league in kickoff return average and punt return average. Since returning from an ankle injury in Week 4, Jamaal Charles has rushed for 510 yards and 6 touchdowns in his last six games, re-establishing himself as one of the game’s best offensive weapons. That includes 64 carries for 339 yards (a 5.30 Y.P.C. average) on first downs in that span, the second most yards behind only Dallas’s DeMarco Murray. Tight end Travis Kelce has emerged as a breakout weapon: According to Pro Football Focus, he is averaging 2.56 yards per route run, the second best average among tight ends behind Rob Gronkowski. Among all players to catch at least 75 percent of passes thrown their way (minimum: 40 targets), Kelce had the highest yards per catch average (12.9). Quarterback Alex Smith continues to succeed at leading a conservative, ball-control offense. After throwing three interceptions in Week 1, he has thrown one in the last eight weeks, the fewest among regular starting quarterbacks in that period. He leads a very safe passing attack: His average pass has traveled 5.77 yards in the air, easily the least of any starting quarterback (Oakland’s Derek Carr is closest, at 7.31). This will not lead to many individual honors or highlight plays, but it is part of the process that leads to makable third downs and long drives. One other factor is driving Kansas City’s offense: Once it gets inside the 20-yard line, the Chiefs do not waste opportunities. They have scored a touchdown on 69 percent of red zone scoring opportunities, the fourth best rate in football. Since that Week 1 disaster, Kansas City has rushed for 13 touchdowns, the most in the N.F.L. in that span. The offense’s slow pace has helped the defense, too. The Chiefs have allowed the fewest passing yards in the N.F.L. this year; that is a credit to the defense, but also to the offense, as Kansas City has faced 299 pass attempts, the fifth fewest of any defense. The Chiefs’ pass defense is powered by outside linebacker Justin Houston, who leads the league with 12 sacks. According to Pro Football Focus, he leads all 3-4 outside linebackers with 45 pressures, which includes sacks, hurries and quarterback knockdowns. Kansas City lost two of its best defensive players for the season in the ugly loss to Tennessee: Inside linebacker Derrick Johnson and defensive end Mike DeVito suffered Achilles tears. Johnson had made the Pro Bowl for his third straight season in 2013, while Kansas City had already lost its other starting defensive end from last year, Tyson Jackson, to free agency. Those three losses have shown up on the statistical sheet — Kansas City ranks 30th in yards per carry allowed — but not on the scoreboard. The Chiefs rank second in fewest points allowed and are also second in red zone defense (opponents have scored touchdowns on just 42.3 percent of drives) and goal-to-go defense (opponents have scored touchdowns only 57.1 percent of the time). Despite the general struggles on the ground, Kansas City has incredibly not allowed a single rushing touchdown all season: Each of the other 31 teams has allowed at least four. In addition to Houston, outside linebacker Tamba Hali and nose tackle Dontari Poe are having their usual great seasons. Cornerback Sean Smith is having a strong season, too. The Chiefs have the third best third-down defense in football, allowing conversions at a rate of 34.5 percent. And Kansas City’s defense ranks fourth in sack rate, at 8.6 percent. Last year, Coach Andy Reid helped turn a 2-14 club into a playoff team in one season. Many felt the 2013 Chiefs overachieved, benefiting from good fortune, including a string of games against second- and third-string quarterbacks. This year, Kansas City was supposed to slip back into the middle of the pack in the A.F.C. But after watching the team in the last eight weeks, it is clear that the Week 1 performance was the anomaly. With games against Seattle, Denver and Arizona in the next four weeks, we will see if the Chiefs can continue their dominant ways. One thing to count on: a lot of slow, methodical drives for the offense and a relentless pass rush from the defense. That has always been a great formula for upsets.
