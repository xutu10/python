PRAGUE —  Petra Kvitova and Lucie Safarova won the opening singles matches to give the Czech Republic a 2-0 lead over Germany in the Fed Cup final on Saturday. Kvitova, the Wimbledon champion, cruised past Andrea Petkovic, 6-2, 6-4, and Safarova stretched the lead by defeating 10th-ranked Angelique Kerber, 6-4, 6-4, to put the hosts one win from their third Fed Cup title in four years. The Czechs won their first title as an independent nation in 2011 and retained the trophy the next year. Czechoslovakia won five times, including three straight from 1983-85. The reverse singles and doubles are scheduled for Sunday. Safarova converted her third match point with a forehand passing shot for her third break of the set, having previously held leads of 2-0 and 4-2. Kerber broke Safarova to go ahead by 4-2 in the first set before Safarova fought back by winning four straight games. Petkovic double-faulted to hand Kvitova a match point in the final game and Kvitova, who is ranked No. 4 in the world, converted it when Petkovic sent a forehand too long. Kvitova improved to 22-6 in the Fed Cup singles and evened her head-to-head record with Petkovic at 4-4. “She just played a really good match,” Petkovic said about Kvitova. “We all knew if Petra is in her right spirit and if she plays that way, it’s going be difficult for all the players in this world, not only for me on a fast court.” Kvitova was in the lead at the start and wore her opponent down with powerful serves and groundstrokes combined with occasional precise drop shots. She hit 25 winners compared to Petkovic’s seven. “That was the tactics on the fast court, to attack from the very start,” Kvitova said. Petkovic came into the final having won in Bulgaria last Sunday for her third WTA title of the year, but her relative lack of experience on big occasions proved decisive. Kvitova led the Czechs to their previous two Fed Cup titles while Germany has not won the trophy since 1992. “I was nervous but so was Andrea, and I was trying to capitalize on that,” Kvitova said. “It was not the first time, and I have experience to play like that. I’m just glad I did everything well.” Petkovic double-faulted to drop her serve in the second game of the opening set. Kvitova served an ace in the next game to build a commanding 3-0 lead and attacked Petkovic’s second serve with big forehands to earn another break in the sixth game. Petkovic got one break back to reduce the lead to 5-2 but was broken again when her backhand hit the net on Kvitova’s third set point in the next game. After losing the first set, the 14th-ranked Petkovic broke in the opening game of the second, but Kvitova immediately broke back and looked in control throughout. “It was very important that I got the break back,” Kvitova said.
