The World Marathon Majors is a series of races in Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York, which offers a $1 million purse split between a male and female runner at the end of a two-year cycle. Jeptoo was to fly to New York to be awarded the $500,000 prize for capturing the women’s World Marathon Majors title, as she led with 100 points, 35 points higher than Edna Kiplagat, also of Kenya.

Most athletes were reluctant to discuss doping culture, or the controversy unfolding around one of their top rivals. Should Jeptoo’s B sample come back positive, Kiplagat would lead the World Marathon Majors standings. Kiplagat, who is running in New York on Sunday, said she needed more information before commenting, having just learned of Jeptoo’s positive A sample. She said the chance to win the World Marathon Majors prize would not affect her race. “I’m going to run my best,” she said.
