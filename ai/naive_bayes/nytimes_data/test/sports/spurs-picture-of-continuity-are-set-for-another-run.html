Spurs, Picture of Continuity, Are Set for Another Run
With the same players, save for a rookie, the Spurs are trying to recapture the form they displayed in June when they eviscerated the Heat to win their fifth N.B.A. championship.

LOS ANGELES —  The  Danny Green switched uniforms, from No. 4 to No. 14, his old high school and college number. Coach Gregg Popovich grew a beard, giving him the look of an aged Russian poet. (“Why not?” he said.) And for something really different, the Spurs took on a new player — the rookie Kyle Anderson, who in college envisioned himself becoming the American Boris Diaw, without a predilection for croissants. This is what the Spurs do — they count on their time-tested values and their three ageless pillars (Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker) and see if they might be good enough and lucky enough to win a title. All 14 of the players who played in the playoffs last season are back, along with Anderson, who is filling out the final spot on the roster, as the Spurs try to recapture the form they displayed in June when they eviscerated the Miami Heat to win their fifth N.B.A. championship. “We’ll never play any better than we did the last three games against Miami,” Popovich said. “It won’t happen. We can’t play any better than that. If we got to that level, I’d be thrilled. We’ll see.” When Doc Rivers, now the coach of the Los Angeles Clippers, won a title with the Boston Celtics in 2008, he spent time that summer picking the brain of Terry Francona, then the Red Sox manager, and Bill Belichick, the Patriots’ coach, about how best to prepare teams to repeat. But the most sage advice did not come from them. “Michael Jordan told me the best: ‘You’re going to be shocked at how different your same players are,’ ” Rivers said. “ ‘It will take half the year to get them back into their same roles.’ ” It was a point Popovich did not argue. Only Duncan, Parker, Ginobili and the reserve Matt Bonner were with the Spurs the last time they tried to defend a title — something they have been unable to successfully do in four tries since winning their first championship in 1999. “Some guys might even be enjoying the championship today, and I think that’s totally reasonable, totally logical because they’re human beings,” Popovich said. “To try to fight that is kind of a waste of time. It will take care of itself as we move along.” Popovich was speaking in a corridor outside the visitors’ locker room shortly before the Spurs rallied late Monday to beat the Clippers, 89-85. It was their best performance of the season and evened their record at 3-3 before they headed north to play at Golden State on Tuesday night. The start of the season has been rocky for the Spurs. Kawhi Leonard, the most valuable player of the finals, missed three weeks of training camp with conjunctivitis, and three key role players are injured: Tiago Splitter (calf), Patty Mills (shoulder) and Marco Belinelli (groin). Mills will not return until January after having surgery over the summer, and the Spurs have missed his pace, energy and 3-point shooting off the bench. “You get everybody’s best shot every night,” said Duncan, whose team is seven points away from being winless. “There are no lulls in what you do. The games you show up for, you’re going to get the crowd into it, you’re going to get the team into it. That is definitely a grind.” When Oklahoma City tied the Western Conference finals in May, Popovich took time during a film session to show highlights of the Spurs’ victory parade down the San Antonio River in 2007 as a means of reminding his players what could lie ahead. But now, the reference and rallying points for a long season are closer at hand. “Now, we know what we’re capable of and we need to get back to that level,” Bonner said. “In order to do that, we can’t skip steps or fill-in-your-cliché-blank. We have to embrace the process, do it one day at time and focus on the same things as last year so we can get back to that point.” Although the Spurs are essentially intact, it does not mean they are unchanged. Popovich hired Ettore Messina, a respected Italian coach, and Becky Hammon, the first woman to have a full-time position on an N.B.A. coaching staff, to provide fresh eyes and voices. And he is handing more responsibility to Leonard, the franchise cornerstone-in-waiting, a move that began in earnest Monday night. “We ran more plays for him tonight than I ever have in his career,” Popovich said. “That’s the plan. We’ve got to start giving him the ball. He’s the future. I don’t think Tim and Manu are going to play any more than six or seven more years.” Leonard played the way he did in June. He scored 26 points, tying his regular-season career high, and stole the ball twice in the final two minutes. One of the steals led to the Spurs’ go-ahead basket, and the other steal came off Chris Paul, one of the league’s most careful point guards. The conjunctivitis in Leonard’s right eye is no longer contagious, but his vision has not completely cleared, and may not for several weeks. His conditioning is not where it will be, either. Although Popovich said Leonard never approached him about wanting a more prominent role, Leonard made it clear he was ready. “It’s better to really walk it, instead of just hearing Pop talk about it,” Leonard said. “I’m just going to need that to keep moving forward and be a better player, rather than when that time comes, it just hits me right in the face.” With the exception of Leonard, the Spurs did not shoot well Monday, and the offense has sputtered without Mills and Splitter. But down the stretch, the Spurs’ defense — which Popovich felt was overlooked during the championship run — stopped the Clippers on the final 10 possessions. “They basically gave us a clinic on how to close out a game,” Paul said. It was something that Paul and many others have seen before. It was the Spurs being the Spurs, a formula that — like their roster — remains familiar.
