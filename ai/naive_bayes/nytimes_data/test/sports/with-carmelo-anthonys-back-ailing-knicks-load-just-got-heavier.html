With Carmelo Anthony’s Back Ailing, Knicks’ Load Just Got Heavier
As Anthony recuperated after experiencing what the team described as back spasms, the rest of the Knicks were left to wonder how quickly he could return.

DALLAS — After another loss in a season already brimming with them, J. R. Smith spotted  “He could barely talk,” Smith said. “I didn’t really want to get on his nerves at that point.” When the  On Tuesday, Anthony was recuperating at the team hotel after a late-night visit to a Houston-area doctor to receive pain medication. A team spokesman said it was doubtful that Anthony would play against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night. Anthony was unavailable for comment. “As far as I’m aware, back spasms aren’t really something that you can push or rush,” Coach Derek Fisher said. “Until you can actually play without being in spasms, there isn’t really anything you can do. So hopefully, that will be soon.” Any injury involving Anthony is cause for concern, especially when he is only months removed from signing a $124 million contract that runs through the 2018-19 season. And while he has been a fairly durable player in his 12-year career, he is 30. He is not getting younger. He also plays a punishing brand of basketball. Free throws are an imperfect measure of how much contact a player has absorbed, but perhaps a useful one. Consider that Anthony ranks seventh among active players for most career free throws attempted, with 6,150. He ranks 35th on the career list. He could crack the top 10 by the end of his current contract. He could, that is, if he stays healthy and sticks with his aggressive style of play — the low-block isolations, the back-to-the-basket post-ups, the constant pursuit of whistles in his favor. Anthony has always embraced the physical side of the sport, and he has been able to sustain his approach. But every possession is fraught with risk, and he led the league in minutes played per game last season. It is worth noting that back spasms are not uncommon in the N.B.A. Dr. Andrew Hecht, the chief of spine surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, said that back spasms typically originate in the muscles. Treatment often includes physical therapy, medication and the application of heat. “Ninety-five percent of people who have the garden-variety muscle spasms from sprains or strains, so to speak, are usually better in three to four weeks,” Hecht said in a telephone interview. Smith dealt with back spasms in the preseason and was able to play through the pain, although he said it had taken about a month for his back to feel normal. Smith, who cautioned that he was “not a back specialist or anything,” said he suspected his problems had been a result of long bus rides to exhibition games. “My hips got out of place a little bit, and it messed up my lower back,” he said. It is unclear what caused Anthony’s spasms. Late in the first half against the Rockets, he retreated to the locker room with the tortured gait of an arthritic octogenarian. Cole Aldrich, moonlighting as a 7-foot cane, walked with Anthony in case he needed someone to lean on. Anthony’s return was considered questionable, then doubtful early in the third quarter, then impossible as the Rockets pulled away in the fourth. Afterward, Smith said he could sense that Anthony was in severe pain. The way Anthony was moving (very little) and talking (very little) in the locker room was alarming to his teammates. “Absolutely,” Smith said. “We just have to figure out a way to make up for that 27, 28 points a game. And his presence — I think that’s the biggest part.” In light of his team’s injury woes, Fisher has developed a verbal tic of prefacing his comments by explaining that he is not a doctor. He tends to avoid offering timelines, and he seldom relays whatever information he receives from the team’s medical staff. In some ways, he is already acting like a veteran coach. It was more of the same on Tuesday, as Fisher fielded questions about how Anthony was feeling: “I would assume he felt better with some medication.” About what could have caused the spasms: “Maybe there are some things that led up to it.” And about when Anthony might return: “I don’t know if we’ll know enough to diagnose where he is and where he’s headed for another day or so.” In the meantime, Fisher said, the rest of the team might need to compensate for Anthony’s potential absence — however long it lasts. Fisher worked to put a positive spin on the situation, saying it might embolden some of the other players to become more self-reliant. “So we’ll see how our guys respond to it,” Fisher said, “if that’s what it is.” REBOUNDS Larry Brown, a onetime Knicks coach who is now coaching at Southern Methodist, made a cameo appearance at the end of the practice. Brown, who has been critical of the current Knicks hierarchy, appeared to have a pleasant chat with Derek Fisher.
