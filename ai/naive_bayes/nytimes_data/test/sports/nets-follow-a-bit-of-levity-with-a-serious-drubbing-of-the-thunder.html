Nets Follow a Bit of Levity With a Serious Drubbing of the Thunder
Mikhail D. Prokhorov offered up some jokes, one about the departure of the former Nets coach Jason Kidd, and then his team, with Brook Lopez back for the home opener, routed Oklahoma City.

It had been almost 10 months since  Prokhorov, who has made only sporadic appearances at Barclays Center the past few years, was asked about his perspective on Jason Kidd, the team’s coach last season who left this summer after a widely reported attempt to nab more organizational power. “I think there is a nice proverb of English: ‘Don’t let the door hit you where the good Lord split you,’ ” said Prokhorov, a 49-year-old Russian billionaire. He later added of Kidd, now the coach of the Milwaukee Bucks: “I think we shouldn’t get mad; I think we should get even. And we will see it on the court.” The Nets have entered the season with little hype and diminished expectations, but Prokhorov said a championship was still the goal. Upon purchasing the team, Prokhorov joked that he would get married as punishment if the club did not win a championship before 2015. He emphasized Monday that he would not follow through on that, no matter the outcome of the season. “We have lost George Clooney,” Prokhorov said of the actor, who was married in September. “I think that’s enough for this year.” It was a comical start to an entertaining night, which the Nets capped on the court with a rollicking 116-85 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, improving their record to 2-1. The most encouraging element of the game for the Nets was the return of center Brook Lopez, who was playing for the first time since Dec. 20, 2013, when he fractured his right foot. Lopez had a sloppy start, heading back to the bench just 1 minute 49 seconds into the game after picking up two quick fouls. But he found a groove, finishing with 18 points, 6 rebounds and 2 blocks in 24 minutes and providing the sort of inside presence the team had sorely lacked in its first two games. “I missed it for a long time,” Lopez said. The Nets had a 13-point lead after one quarter, meaning a majority of the contest lacked much competitive tension. As such, the most exciting play of the night came in the final seconds of the second quarter. Bojan Bogdanovic (12 points) grabbed a rebound with 3.6 seconds remaining, raced the length of the court and lobbed the ball to Mason Plumlee (10 points, 8 rebounds), who smashed it through the hoop with both hands a fraction of a second before the halftime buzzer. It was a win, an easy one, but conclusions drawn from it will have to be taken with a grain of salt, given the recent depletion of the Oklahoma City roster. Kevin Durant, the league’s most valuable player last season, watched from the bench. He had surgery last month to repair a fractured right foot. And point guard Russell Westbrook will be out at least four more weeks after having surgery last weekend to repair a fractured bone in his right hand. The Nets shot 52.4 percent from the field, getting 17 points and 9 assists from Deron Williams. They had 25 assists, and each of the five starters had 8 to 10 shot attempts. “When the ball is moving like that, we’re having fun, we’re sharing the basketball — that’s what we want,” Williams said. The blowout sucked some of the energy out of the night. And Prokhorov’s interview was a tough act to follow. Beyond ribbing his former coach, he also attempted to slow down the recent speculation that he was interested in selling some, or all, of his 80 percent stake in the club, saying that he was listening to offers, but only those that would allow him to remain in control of the organization. “I think, for the time being, nothing is imminent,” he said. “But still, I think it’s not bad just to listen.” The Nets, who spent close to $200 million last year on salaries and luxury taxes, appeared to change course this summer, allowing Paul Pierce to leave as a free agent. “We need success now, but also we need to think about the future,” Prokhorov said. Prokhorov said repeatedly that the organization’s market value was five or six times what he had spent almost five years ago. Perhaps that explained his response to a question about a recent report that the team’s basketball operations department had lost $144 million last season. “It’s not a big deal,” he said.
