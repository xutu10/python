Arizona State’s Elevation to Division I Alters Hockey’s Profile in the West
The Sun Devils’ promotion to N.C.A.A. status opens college hockey to the West and to a metropolitan area of four million people, and it gives the N.C.A.A. a 60th Division I program.

On a sunny 74-degree day in Tempe, Ariz., as most other college hockey teams were snowed in or coping with freezing temperatures, Arizona State made a surprise announcement that it would join N.C.A.A. Division I next season. Arizona State’s bold move on Tuesday to elevate its club team drew a swift reaction. “I don’t want to overstate it,” said Mike Snee, the executive director of College Hockey Inc., an independent marketing arm for the sport. “But other than the creation of hockey itself, there hasn’t been a single event the sport can build off more.” The  The ultimate goal is the creation of a Pacific-12 hockey conference. Currently, Arizona State plays in Division I of the American Collegiate Hockey Association, where it was ranked No. 1 with a record of 18-1-0 entering the weekend. Arizona and Colorado play in the same division. The other Pac-12 teams play in A.C.H.A. Division II, except for Oregon State, which has no hockey program. Arizona State’s athletic director, Ray Anderson, hired in January after more than seven years as the N.F.L.’s executive vice president for football operations, said the Pac-12 supported the move. “The hope is that Arizona State will tip the dominoes to get some of the Northern schools, in Washington and Oregon, and our folks in California who have programs and probably don’t want to see us competing when they’re not,” he said. Hockey would provide valuable content for the two-year-old Pac-12 Networks, which are wholly owned by the conference members and reach 40 million homes. Arizona State has had club hockey teams for more than 25 years. Last season, the fourth under Coach Greg Powers, the Sun Devils went 38-2-0, winning their first A.C.H.A. championship. Powers, a former goaltender who balanced his full-time job as managing partner of an executive search firm in Scottsdale, Ariz., while building his hockey program into a perennial power, will coach the Sun Devils as they enter a new era. “We now have a responsibility to make this work,” he said. With an enrollment of 77,000, Arizona State is the largest public university in the country, and almost 200,000 alumni live within 20 minutes of the campus, so fan support should not be a problem. Since Wayne Gretzky joined the Los Angeles Kings in 1988 and the N.H.L. expanded across the Sun Belt in the 1990s, amateur hockey participation in this country has more than doubled, to about 520,000, according to USA Hockey. That increase has had an effect at all levels. Last season, 31 percent of N.H.L. players had college hockey experience, and this year, 200 N.H.L. draft picks are playing in N.C.A.A. Division I, according to College Hockey Inc. “College hockey needs more teams because of the quantity of quality players,” Snee said. With the addition of Arizona State, there will be about 1,200 roster spots in Division I hockey. By comparison, Division I basketball has 4,500 roster spots (351 teams), and football has 7,500 roster spots (252 teams). Next season, the Sun Devils will play A.C.H.A. and N.C.A.A. Division I teams; in 2016-17, they will play a full Division I schedule. Anderson said that if Arizona State could not secure a hockey conference membership, the program would remain independent. The Division I program was financed by a $32 million gift, the largest in the university’s athletics history for one sport, from Don Mullett, the father of a former Sun Devils player, and an anonymous donor. The gift will pay for the program, including 18 scholarships, for at least 10 years. It will also finance the addition of a women’s sport so that Arizona State is in compliance with Title IX. “We’re very confident that there are enough gung-ho folks who want to support A.S.U. hockey that we’ll end up being self-sustaining and fully funded in four to five years,” Anderson said. For more than a year, an informal group interested in expanding college hockey has been working to identify teams that might be interested in joining Division I. The group includes Bill Daly, the deputy commissioner of the N.H.L., and Joe Battista, a former coach and a founding member of the A.C.H.A., who helped guide Penn State into Division I in 2012. In July, Justin Emerson, an Arizona State student,  Snee and Battista said they believed Arizona State’s move would encourage more universities to upgrade their hockey programs. In fact, Snee said, within 24 hours of the A.S.U. announcement, he received emails or calls from people asking for help to “make it happen” at universities they support. The Sun Devils play at Oceanside Ice Arena, a nearby public rink with 500 seats. Until an on-campus hockey arena is built, the only options are US Airways Center in downtown Phoenix, home of the N.B.A.’s Suns, and the on-campus Wells Fargo Arena, which is the home of Sun Devils basketball and is not configured for hockey. Until Pac-12 hockey becomes a reality — the N.C.A.A. requires six teams for conference play — only two leagues are geographically appropriate for Arizona State: the nine-member Western Collegiate Hockey Association and the eight-member National Collegiate Hockey Conference. Although some teams have contacted Powers about making a trip to Tempe, the pool of potential opponents includes many established programs with a history of success. Powers said he saw the road ahead as “fun and challenging.” Battista, who said he had watched the news conference from Tempe with tears in his eyes, knows what lies ahead. “Greg’s going to be jumping into the deep end,” he said, chuckling, “but at least in Tempe, Ariz., he’s got a pool.”
