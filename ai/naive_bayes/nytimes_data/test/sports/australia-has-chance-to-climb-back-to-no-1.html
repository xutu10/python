Australia Has Chance to Climb Back to No. 1 in Cricket
Australia will dislodge South Africa as the top-ranked team if it sweeps a two-test series with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.

Rookie spin bowlers could hold the key as Pakistan goes for its first victory over Australia in 20 years in a series of two five-day test matches starting Wednesday in the United Arab Emirates. Pakistan was set to pair Zulfiqar Babar, a 35-year-old left-armer who has played only two tests before, with Yasir Shah, a 28-year-old wrist spinner who will be making his debut. Australia also is likely to field its own newcomer with plenty of experience at other levels of the game: left-armer Steve O’Keefe, who will turn 30 next month. Australia’s chief selector, Rodney Marsh, has said the roster was unlikely to be settled until the morning of the match. But O’Keefe received a warm endorsement from Australia captain Michael Clarke, which hinted that he could join Australia’s established spinner, Nathan Lyon, on the team. “His selection would be a fitting reward for the years of toil he has put in at first-class level,” Clarke told The Daily Telegraph, a Sydney newspaper. “He is a player who, as he has matured, has really come to understand his game and play to his strengths.” If he plays, O’Keefe will be the 14th spinner chosen by Australia since Shane Warne, its all-time record wicket-taker, played his last test in 2007. Pakistan goes into the series missing its top spinner. Saeed Ajmal, by far its most effective bowler, was banned in September after his bowling action was ruled illegal. Ajmal was effective in all formats of the game and under all conditions, but nowhere is he more formidable than in the Emirates, Pakistan’s home away from home since it was prohibited from hosting test matches after a terrorist attack on Sri Lankan players in Lahore in 2009. “I think there is no doubt that Ajmal is an amazing bowler. I think obviously Pakistan wish they had him available for selection,” Clarke told journalists last week. “I have always said that Pakistan have always had a lot of talent in any form of the game.” Pakistan is also missing two first-choice fast bowlers, Junaid Khan and Wahab Riaz. Both have knee injuries. “Their exit is a setback,” admitted Pakistan Coach Waqar Younis, a member of the last Pakistan team to record a series victory over Australia in 1994. “But that doesn’t mean that we sit and give up. Babar is bowling well and Yasir Shah has improved. The bowling attack is good. It may be inexperienced, but it’s good.” Each team can draw encouragement from their preliminary games. Australia won all four matches in the shorter formats — three one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match. But it then lost to Pakistan A, its second-string team, in a four-day warmup match. Waqar believes the four-day match showed Australia’s limitations. “They are a fine team, very professional side and do their things well, but yeah, we have definitely seen some weaknesses and we are working on it and hopefully we will deliver the goods,” he said. The incentive for Australia is that a 2-0 sweep would take it to the top of the world rankings, displacing South Africa. Much will depend on the performance of its star paceman, Mitchell Johnson. Apparently washed up a year ago, Johnson has enjoyed a career revival that has also transformed Australia as a team. He devastated England’s batsmen in a 5-0 Ashes sweep in Australia, then was almost as fearsome in a shocking 2-1 series victory in South Africa. The match beginning Wednesday at Dubai International Cricket Stadium will be Australia’s first test in seven months, and it is possible that Johnson’s hot streak has run its course. Fields in the Gulf rarely favor bowlers who rely on speed, and Pakistan will want the groundskeepers to keep it that way. But Waqar, a truly great paceman in his own day, recognizes the threat Johnson represents. “There is no doubt that Johnson will be an X-factor,” he said. “He is the most improved bowler in the last two, three years.”
