Memories Are Forever, but Owning a Medal Isn’t for Some Soccer Legends
Jimmy Greaves is the latest player from England’s 1966 World Cup-winning team to put his medal up for auction.

LONDON — Being an athlete apparently was not high on the list of Walter Mitty. Times change, however, and there is a big market now for those who want to live the fantasy that comes with sports memorabilia. Just as baseball jerseys and equipment have fetched hundreds of thousands of dollars in New York, so Graham Budd Auctions in London put fancy prices on soccer memorabilia on Tuesday. The older the better, because it has been some time, approaching half a century, since England ruled what England invented. Among the lots under the hammer were, for the second time around, the 1953 F.A. Cup winner’s medal of Stanley Matthews, the knight of the wing. Also resold, for 136,000 pounds, or about $216,000, was the 1966 medal won by left back Ray Wilson when England won the World Cup for the first, and only, time. More curious, there is the medal struck 43 years after that event for a man who never played in the World Cup final, Jimmy Greaves. It was sold for £44,000. To be fair, Greaves never asked for it to be minted in the first place. The fans did. They campaigned in the tens of thousands until FIFA and the English F.A. relented and changed the custom of granting medals only to the 11 winning players on the field at the final whistle of a World Cup. Greaves, a magnificent goal scorer who could pick the ball from the pockets of defenders before they even knew he was around them, struck 44 goals in 57 games for England and 491 goals for Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, A.C. Milan and West Ham during a career he ended at the age of 31. Greaves was a natural, on and off the field. You could not coach the poacher’s instinct that he and the great German Gerd Müller had. And while you couldn’t coach it, it was also nearly impossible for opponents to stop those two from doing it, either. When Greaves retired, he was not one of those washed-up athletes who then acted like a fish out of water. He could speak as well as he played. His quick wit made him popular on the speaking circuit, and it also netted him a British television show alongside the former Liverpool winger Ian St. John, the “Saint and Greavsie Show.” The Premier League era of high salaries came too late for Greaves, whose biggest paycheck was the £100 per week that he earned near end of his career, so he did not retire a rich man. And like Müller, Greaves drifted toward alcoholism, a fight that ended up the biggest contest for each, and ultimately the biggest triumph. Greaves, now 74, has not made public his reason for selling his World Cup medal. We could guess because the grand house he once owned is gone, because the sports talk shows he used to appear on are populated by younger, more recently retired players, or because his public speaking engagements are largely things of the past. Greaves has an easy-come, easy-go attitude to life. He was bemused by the campaign to get him a World Cup medal. He had started the tournament seven months after a bout of hepatitis stole a step from his nimbleness. Then in the third game of the ’66 Cup, a dreadful foul from the Frenchman Joseph Bonnell gashed his shin, requiring 14 stitches. Greaves admitted to being hurt, to feeling hollow, in missing out on that final. But he said, convincingly, that he “couldn’t give a monkey’s” about not getting a medal for being part of the final 11 on the field. It is often a fact of life that old players, like old soldiers, fade away, and it is also a fact that some players have less than others to fall back on in retirement. Eight of the English 11 from the 1966 World Cup final — the only Englishmen ever to win a national team trophy — have sold their medals or had them sold by surviving family members. The medal belonging to Nobby Stiles fetched £188,200. Alan Ball’s realized £164,00. Geoff Hurst, who replaced Greaves and scored a hat trick in the final against West Germany, sold his medal for £150,000, the same sum that Bobby Moore’s medal fetched for charity. Goalkeeper Gordon Banks’s realized £124,750, while those from the fullbacks George Cohen and Ray Wilson each got £80,000. Martin Peters, so stealthy on the field that opponents barely saw him create opportunities, never divulged his windfall from selling his medal. Just three of the 1966 medals remain with the original owners: Bobby and Jack Charlton kept theirs. Roger Hunt, as successful in business as he was industrious as a player, never needed to pawn his medal. And sometimes, the buyers have needs. Nick Hancock, an English television personality and comedian, sold for £220,000 the Matthews F.A. Cup medal for which he paid closer to £20,000 pounds in 2001. Hancock recently told reporters: “When I bought it, I had a job and no children. Now I have children, and no job.” What goes around, comes around — with the exception of England’s only once winning the World Cup, on home soil at London’s Wembley stadium.
