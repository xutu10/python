Patriots Sprint Past Dolphins to Wrap Up Division Title
New England led by just 1 point at halftime but scored 24 points in the third quarter in a home game against Miami.

Rebounding from a mediocre first half, the  Leading by just 14-13 at halftime, the Patriots scored on four consecutive series while piling up 24 points, the most in any third period in team history. The Patriots also became the first team in N.F.L. history with 11 division titles in 12 years. “We didn’t play very well in the first half,” Patriots Coach  New England can secure home-field advantage throughout the A.F.C. playoffs by beating the Jets and the Bills. Miami’s slim postseason hopes dwindled further. BILLS 21, PACKERS 13 Late in the game, defensive end Mario Williams forced Rodgers to fumble, and running back Eddie Lacy picked up the ball with 1 minute 51 seconds left, but the play was whistled dead for a safety because only Rodgers was allowed to advance the ball at that point. Dan Carpenter hit all three of his field-goal attempts, including a 51-yarder in the second half to help keep Buffalo in the A.F.C. playoff picture. The Bills also have their first eight-win season since going 9-7 in 2004. BRONCOS 22, CHARGERS 10 Manning left the game late in the second quarter. He apparently hurt his thigh while blocking linebacker Donald Butler on a run by C. J. Anderson. Manning returned for the start of the third quarter, and on Denver’s second possession, he threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas to give the Broncos a 16-3 lead. COLTS 17, TEXANS 10 The Colts have won four straight, but this one was not easy. Luck was 18 of 34 with 187 yards and an interception. The rookie Texans quarterback Tom Savage replaced the injured Ryan Fitzpatrick and was ineffective, going 10 of 19 for 127 yards. SEAHAWKS 17, 49ERS 7 The Seahawks, the defending Super Bowl champions, remained in contention for a division title and the No. 1 seed in the N.F.C. After a sluggish, sloppy first half, Seattle awoke in the final 30 minutes behind Lynch’s running and a defense that shut out the 49ers, holding them to 67 yards. Colin Kaepernick was sacked six times, and the 49ers did not run a play past the Seattle 38 in the second half. LIONS 16, VIKINGS 14 Detroit did not have an easy time, spotting the Vikings a 14-0 lead before a pair of second-quarter interceptions helped the Lions start their rally. Even at the end, Detroit had to sweat out a 68-yard field-goal attempt by Minnesota’s Blair Walsh on the game’s final play. The kick was short. STEELERS 27, FALCONS 20 The Steelers remained half a game behind Cincinnati in the A.F.C. North with their second straight win. The Falcons ensured themselves a losing season and slipped out of first place in the N.F.C. South. The Falcons made a game of it, pulling within a touchdown on Ryan’s 4-yard pass to Roddy White. But the Steelers clinched the victory with their final possession, converting twice on third down to run out the clock. PANTHERS 19, BUCCANEERS 17 The win, coupled with Atlanta’s loss to Pittsburgh, left the Panthers half a game behind New Orleans in the division. Carolina can move into first place if the Saints lose to Chicago on Monday night. Anderson was 25 of 40 and improved to 2-0 as a starter in place of Cam Newton, who is sidelined while recovering from injuries sustained in a car accident on Tuesday. RAVENS 20, JAGUARS 12 Baltimore gained only 31 yards rushing through three quarters and scored just once with its offense on the field. But the defense was solid, and special teams helped the Ravens earn a victory they needed to stay in the thick of the A.F.C. playoff chase. Terrell Suggs was credited with two and a half sacks, and the rookie Timmy Jernigan, starting for the suspended Haloti Ngata, had two. CHIEFS 31, RAIDERS 13 Knile Davis had touchdowns running and receiving, and De’Anthony Thomas returned a punt 81 yards for another score as the Chiefs got even for a 24-20 loss to Oakland last month. FORMER PACKER DIES The team confirmed Sunday that Thurston had died after several years of health problems. Born Fred Thurston, he helped Green Bay win five N.F.L. championships. He also won a title with Baltimore in 1958.
