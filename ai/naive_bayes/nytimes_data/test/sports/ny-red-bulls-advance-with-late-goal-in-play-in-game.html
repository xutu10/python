HARRISON, N.J. —  The up-and-down world of  The Red Bulls, last season’s winners of the Supporters’ Shield as the No. 1 team in the regular season, erased a one-goal deficit in the second half to defeat Sporting Kansas City, 2-1, last year’s M.L.S. Cup winner, on two goals by Bradley Wright-Phillips. The victory was the Red Bulls’ first in the postseason in five tries since the club moved to Red Bull Arena in 2010. It was the team’s first home playoff win since October 2005. On Sunday, the Red Bulls will host the first game of a home-and-home Eastern Conference semifinal series against D.C. United, which finished first in the conference. The Red Bulls spurned several chances in the first half, paying dearly in the 53rd minute when Benny Feilhaber of Kansas City stole the ball from Eric Alexander in the midfield, dribbled 30 yards and split the Red Bulls defense with a pass that Dom Dwyer placed past Luis Robles. The Red Bulls drew even in the 77th minute when Peguy Luyindula, who joined the game in the 65th minute, found Thierry Henry on the left. Henry’s soft cross was first-timed by Wright-Phillips past goalkeeper Eric Kronberg. With the match seemingly headed for overtime, Ambroise Oyongo raced down the right flank and hit a looping cross that Wright-Phillips, unmarked in front of goal, nodded inside the far post for the go-ahead goal. Wright-Phillips had finished the regular season with 27 goals, tying the league record. Neither team displayed much initiative or creativity in the first 15 minutes of the game, seemingly more wary of conceding an early goal than interested in scoring one. The Red Bulls, who led the league with 38 goals scored at home, cobbled together a few credible scoring chances in a span of six minutes but were guilty of being a bit too hasty in the attack. In the 17th minute, Henry sent a free kick from the right side into the Sporting penalty area. It sailed over the defense and fell to Jamison Olave, who miscued a shot. The ball fell to Tim Cahill for a chance that he hit over the crossbar, but Cahill was clearly offside. A few minutes later it was again Henry, this time on the left flank, sending a diagonal ball that Wright-Phillips chested down and tucked behind goalkeeper Kronberg. Again the Red Bulls were called for offside. Probably the best chance came in the 32nd minute when midfielder Lloyd Sam slipped past Kansas City defender Seth Sinovic, dribbled to the end line and lifted a right-footed cross that found the head of Wright-Phillips, who nodded it over the bar. NOTES After keeping the core of their roster intact last off-season, the Red Bulls could be headed for wholesale changes, on the field and in the front office. Andy Roxburgh, the sporting director, 71, is expected to leave the club after two seasons in charge. The contract of Thierry Henry, 37, expires at the end of the year and he could return to England with Arsenal as a reserve. There have been reports in Australia that Tim Cahill, 34, will return home and play for Melbourne in the A-League. Bradley Wright-Phillips, 29, who tied the M.L.S. single-season goal-scoring record, could attract renewed attention in England. In addition, all M.L.S. teams are expected to lose players in the expansion draft for Orlando City and New York City F.C., which will join the league in 2015.
