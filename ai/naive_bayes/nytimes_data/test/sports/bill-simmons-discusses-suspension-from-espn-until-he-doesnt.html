Bill Simmons Discusses Suspension From ESPN, Until He Doesn’t
Simmons was suspended for three weeks after calling N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell a “liar” concerning when he became aware of the Ray Rice video.

When Bill Simmons was suspended by  On his newest podcast, which was posted Friday, nearly all of a 15-minute discussion about his suspension was removed from an interview with James Andrew Miller, the co-author of a newly expanded oral history of “Saturday Night Live” as well as one about ESPN. Simmons said that he and his team edited that section of the podcast of his own volition, without telling ESPN what had occurred. “If I’m going on the record about it, I’d rather do it in a real way, with permission from ESPN,” he said Friday during an interview. “That’s what we do with podcasts. We tape them and decide what stays.” Miller initiated the discussion late in the interview, prompting Simmons to joke that Miller was “hijacking my podcast.” A small but unedifying part of it remained after being heavily condensed by Simmons and his team. One question by Miller and an attempt to ask another one stayed in the podcast. Thirteen seconds of elevator music was added as a way to cover the absence of Simmons’s answers. And Simmons left in his caution that “maybe three minutes” of the ESPN segment would survive the editing. Also left in was Simmons’s judgment that the discussion was “illuminating.” In a telephone interview, Miller said: “I totally understand why the elevator music is there. It’s a raw situation right now. Basically, he’s just back after a suspension, and the last thing he needs is to be suspended again.” Simmons said that none of his remarks would have earned another suspension. “I’m trying to move forward,” he said.
