FIFA’s Investigative Report Is Stamped Top Secret
An exhaustive investigation of FIFA by Michael J. Garcia, a former United States attorney, yielded a report that has yet to be released publicly.
===
It sounds like a Tom Clancy screenplay, an international tale of conflict straight from central casting: the dogged investigator, charged with uncovering wrongdoing; the aged overlord, determined to keep the investigator’s report from seeing the light of day; and the well-intentioned agents of change pushing for justice while battling the old cronies (and, naturally, themselves). Sometimes it feels as if all that is missing from the world soccer scene these days is a gravelly-voiced narrator intoning, “Sepp Blatter said that’s all he knew ... but was it?” By now, even the most engaged soccer fans may find FIFA’s machinations a bit too much to follow. But there is an important, if alarming, revelation to be taken from this latest twist, so the short version of the story goes something this: Four years ago, FIFA’s executive committee, led by its longtime president, Blatter, voted to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. Both results were stunning, as was the notion of voting for two tournaments at the same time, which seemed to invite vote trading. Allegations of corruption and a tainted process emerged  Garcia spent more than 18 months crisscrossing the globe to interview witnesses and informants and stakeholders and voters, and this year he submitted a 350-page report that also included about 200,000 pages of evidence. The report may or may not be the proverbial smoking gun, but regardless, it might offer a rare window into just how seamy the global soccer business can be. That is, if anyone — even some of the people named in it — ever gets to see it. At the moment, only four people are believed to have seen the report: Garcia and his deputy, who produced it, as well as Hans-Joachim Eckert, the head of the adjudicatory arm of the FIFA ethics committee, who will determine whether it merits further discipline, and Eckert’s deputy. Some current members of the ExCo tried to expand that circle during the committee’s meeting last month in Zurich, pushing for the report to be appropriately redacted (to protect whistle-blowers or other witnesses) and then  According to multiple people in the room, Blatter shut down any meaningful discussion on the issue during the ExCo meeting, differentiating between members who were part of the committee for the World Cup vote in 2010 and those who were not. Essentially, Blatter argued, those who were not there for the vote were not entitled to have a say on whether the investigation into that vote should be made public. During a news conference after the meeting, Blatter — as if imitating the stereotypical villain — declared flatly that, in fact, no one raised the issue of disclosing the report during the meeting, punctuating this assertion  When told of Blatter’s comments, several ExCo members were furious — because Blatter had misrepresented what had happened and there had been a loud debate about releasing the report. FIFA’s director of communications assured those who complained that a public clarification would be made. No such clarification was issued. In an interview last week, Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer and an ExCo member, said there was unquestionably a discussion about transparency. “Numerous members of the ExCo, including me, have spoken passionately about the need for appropriate disclosure,” Gulati said. “So you can be sure there were plenty of strong views expressed.” Moya Dodd, another ExCo member and a vice president of the Asian Football Confederation, also spoke in favor of disclosure, saying that “enough must be published about the reasons and evidence to give the football public confidence in both the process and the outcome.” So this is where it stands: Eckert has promised to deliver an initial reaction to the report — a report on the report, one might call it —  Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that FIFA has decided to take its showcase tournament to Russia and then Qatar in the next two cycles. The governments in each country operate much as FIFA’s leaders do: secretly and at the direction of  Think about how Gulati answered a question about Blatter’s attempts to restrict newer ExCo members from voting on subjects that predated them: “Governments don’t work like that. Elected officials don’t pass on voting for laws that were raised before they were elected, right?” Yet Blatter still thought it was a reasonable position to take. In all likelihood, the entire Garcia report — or even most of it — will never be seen. Such is the power of an organization like FIFA, which essentially operates with no oversight, no restrictions and no accountability. As president, Blatter, who has held the job since 1998, is  There is another election in May, and Blatter, 78, has said he will run again because continuity, he believes, is what the people want. His people, he means, and there can be no denying that whatever is in the Garcia report — whether little or big — it will not be glowing, gushing reviews of what Blatter and his people did four years ago. To keep that report hidden until after the votes are counted is to all but ensure re-election. Therein, of course, is the chilling realization for those who love soccer and follow soccer and want to see, finally, some measure of change in soccer. The Garcia report is not a silver bullet; it is probably not even the sort of stun-the-world investigation that would prompt a re-vote on where the next two World Cups should be held. Yet it is important all the same, a document that represents a dollop of accountability and a sliver of responsibility. It should be made public, but it will not be. Blatter will keep it hidden. Because he can.
