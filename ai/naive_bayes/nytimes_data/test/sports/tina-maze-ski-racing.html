Tina Maze Puts Chaotic Year Behind and Dominates Again
The Slovenian skier, who won two golds at the Sochi Olympics but struggled all through the World Cup season, has won three times so far this season, all in different disciplines.

DENVER — On March 2013, Tina Maze of Slovenia made history when she collected 2,414 points in a single World Cup season, shattering the Austrian great Hermann Maier’s previous record of 2,000. Since then, Maze’s career has been a tumultuous tableau of highs and lows. In less than two years, three coaches have left her small team. Amid one of her worst World Cup seasons in years, she won two gold medals at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia. In March, her head coach/team manager/boyfriend Andrea Massi quit her team. At the end of last season, the star racer’s future was uncertain. Maze, 31, has come a long way since March. Today, she is coming off of five podium finishes in nine races and  “I’m skiing like two years ago. It’s pretty amazing. It’s a lot of work and experience behind that.” Maze has climbed back to the top of ski racing after finishing fourth in the overall standings last year with only 964 points, 1,450 fewer than the year before. She attributes her dismal 2014 season to emotional and physical exhaustion from her record-breaking 2013 season. “I was tired after the big season, and I had trouble finding the good feeling on my skis,” Maze said in an interview last month in Vail, Colo. Last season’s struggles started early. By January, Maze had only three podium finishes, compared to eleven at the same time the year before. So, she fired her coach, Walter Ronconi, and hired Mauro Pini. Ronconi had been with the team less than a year, starting in June 2013 to replace Livio Magoni, who resigned after the season ended in March 2013. With Pini at the helm, it wasn’t long before Maze was back to her winning ways. On Jan. 25, she won her first race of the season, a downhill in Cortina, Italy. She regained her form just in time for the Olympics, where she nabbed two gold medals in the giant slalom and downhill, becoming the first Slovenian to win gold at a winter Games. “It was a dream for me,” Maze said. “When the emotions hit me and I realized what happened it was huge.” But after the Olympics, Maze’s slump continued. Her season came to a head in March at the World Cup finals in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. After Maze finished more than five seconds behind Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States in the slalom’s first run, Massi resigned from the team. (Shiffrin went on to win the event.) “For me, it’s not respect to make one run and be five seconds behind,” Massi said. “I have respect for the sport, and for sponsors, and for the Slovenian people, and so we had a big clash.” A few days later, Pini also left the team. At the end of the 2014 season, Team to aMaze, Maze’s independent team, was in tatters. By summer, Maze and Massi reconciled, and he rejoined the team. They immediately implemented changes. First, Maze took some time off to study to become an elementary school teacher, the profession she will likely pursue after her ski career ends. She hired a new female physiotherapist, who, Maze said, has offered her some much-needed female companionship on the grueling World Cup circuit this season. She also brought on Valerio Ghirardi, an Italian with twenty years of coaching experience, to replace Pini. And, when it came to ski racing, Massi realized that he needed to put some distance between himself and his star athlete. “I took a step back,” Massi said. “It’s hard for a lot of coaches in their careers to take a step back. It was very difficult for me, but she goes fast now and that is what is important.” Judging from her early season results, the modifications have worked. After finishing 22nd in the opening race in Sölden, Austria, Maze has won three races thus far. What makes Maze’s success all the more impressive is that her victories have come in three different disciplines — slalom, giant slalom, and downhill — events that require vastly different skills. She is one of only six women in history to have won in all five World Cup events. “Being able to switch from one discipline to another is tough. It’s like going from tennis to Ping-Pong,” she said. At the moment, Maze is a master of all disciplines and has her eyes set on world championship medals, the overall title, and retirement, which will likely happen after this season. “It’s really great what we are doing and I hope to stay on the top.” Look to Maze to wrap her career with a very tidy bow.
