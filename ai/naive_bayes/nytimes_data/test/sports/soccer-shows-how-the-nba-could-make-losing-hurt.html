Soccer Shows How the N.B.A Could Make Losing Hurt
With a relegation system like those in European soccer leagues, the worst N.B.A. teams would be sent down to lower tiers, providing an incentive to avoid tanking.

There are some terrible, terrible basketball teams in the  The  The Philadelphia 76ers lost their first 17 games and looked so bad doing so that there was open speculation about whether they could beat a top college team. And what penalties will these teams pay for their  Indeed, the worst of the worst will be rewarded for failure with better draft picks next year than the teams that fought hard to win a few more games. That is why some fans, including the former Lakers superstar  But what if teams that bad faced a punishment more fitting for their crimes? Imagine if, as in soccer leagues around the world, the very worst N.B.A. teams were relegated to a lower league the following season. The benefits would be tangible, and immediate. The specter of tanking would cease to haunt the N.B.A. Teams would have to fight tooth and nail to stay where they were, instead of finding themselves, heaven forbid, in the N.B.A. Development League the next season. The annual and unsavory spectacle in which losing teams dump good players late in the season would come to an end. Teams instead would constantly beat the bushes to improve themselves while keeping a wary eye on those behind them in the standings. From a fan’s perspective, the conclusion of the regular season would improve immeasurably, as European soccer leagues demonstrate every year. As it stands, games in March and April often decide little except perhaps whether a team will wind up as the fifth- or sixth-seeded team in the postseason. And games between bad teams become unwatchable. For instance, on April 15, 2015, the Detroit Pistons, another awful N.B.A. club, will play the Knicks at the Garden. Tickets will be full price. Any interest in going? Yeah, didn’t think so. But if relegation existed, that game could well determine whether Carmelo Anthony and the other Knicks heirs to Willis Reed and Patrick Ewing would be playing their games next season in San Antonio and Miami, or in Sioux Falls and Reno. Or whether Detroit would suffer that fate. Now that’s real drama. And imagine what it would be like if a big-name team, in particular, were relegated. What could be more delightful than seeing Kobe Bryant and his fellow highly paid members of the Lakers suiting up to play the Fort Wayne Mad Ants in a D League game? With relegation, of course, comes promotion, with other teams moving up to take the place of the clubs moving down. That, in turn, could deliver a needed jolt of energy to professional basketball nationwide. There are 351 Division I college basketball teams. There is no reason that there could not be 100 thriving professional basketball teams in the country — if those teams had the carrot of a real chance of promotion to the N.B.A. someday. Would not Seattle support such a team? Tampa Bay, St. Louis and Pittsburgh? Couldn’t Chicago have more than one team, and New York and Los Angeles more than two? Such a system would also mean longer careers for fading N.B.A. stars and more jobs for younger American professional players. And a better chance for a college star to ply his profession for the Louisville Thoroughbreds or the Harlem Renaissance rather than for Real Madrid or the Liaoning Flying Leopards. And this system might curtail cities’ practice of handing out huge tax breaks and free arenas to teams for fear of their leaving town. If a team did try to leave, a local entrepreneur could simply start up a new one. If fans turned out, the money would be there to climb up the leagues and get the city its N.B.A. status back in a few years. What could be more, well, capitalist? Ah, but that brings us to the problem with our little thought experiment. It is never going to happen. N.B.A. owners, as might be expected, quite enjoy the financial benefits that a monopoly brings. Imagine telling an owner that his N.B.A. franchise, currently worth almost a billion dollars, could lose, say, three-quarters of that value because of a couple of bad seasons and the relegation that results. English soccer That sort of implosion should be terrifying to American sports owners. And it means we’re not going to be seeing any seismic changes like a relegation system. Enjoy that Pistons-Knicks season finale, folks!
