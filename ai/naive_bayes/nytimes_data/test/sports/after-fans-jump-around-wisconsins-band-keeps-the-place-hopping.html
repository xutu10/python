After Fans Jump Around, Wisconsin’s Band Keeps the Place Hopping
The University of Wisconsin marching band helps to turn every game at Madison’s Camp Randall Stadium into a raucous celebration.

Before there was “Jump Around,” there was “You’ve Said It All.” The blasting of House of Pain’s 1992 song “Jump Around” from the loudspeakers between the third and fourth quarters at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wis., and the way that 80,000 fans follow the song’s instructions and thus create the sensation of an earthquake (the press box really does shake), have become a  “Jump Around” made its debut in its modern form, according to Barry Alvarez, the former Wisconsin football coach and current athletic director, on Oct. 10, 1998, when Wisconsin hosted Purdue and its  But two decades earlier, the Budweiser jingle “You’ve Said It All” occupied center stage, until it was thought to be too raucous and was banished to a postgame celebration now known as the Fifth Quarter. “I came here at a time when football fortunes were pretty poor,” said Michael Leckrone, who arrived in Madison in 1969 and has directed the university’s marching band since 1975. “We tried to make it a little more showbiz.” But he might have gone too far. The last straw, Leckrone said, came after the playing of “You’ve Said It All” during a 22-19 victory over Oregon early in the 1978 season. The stadium shook so much that Athletic Director Elroy Hirsch put a stop to it. The song itself was an early-1970s advertising ditty composed by the jingle writer Steve Karmen. “When you say Budweiser,” it goes, “you’ve said it all.” Wisconsin fans replace “Budweiser” with “Wisconsin.” Leckrone had begun to anchor a smaller, though still raucous, postgame celebration around “Beer Barrel Polka” — “I figured it’s Wisconsin; everyone knows how to polka,” said Leckrone, who is from Indiana — and soon several other songs were added, including “You’ve Said It All.” Glenn Miller of The Wisconsin State Journal named the postgame festivities the Fifth Quarter, and Wisconsin put a “5” on the scoreboard after games. These days, several thousand fans can be counted on to stay after for the band’s 20- to 30-minute performance in and near the north end zone. Attendance varies, depending mainly on whether the Badgers won, Leckrone said. Cold and snow did not deter a sizable crowd from sticking around after  The band launched into the theme from “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Dancers formed circles around other dancers, who made snow angels; only Bucky Badger, the mascot, declined, presumably not wanting to ruin his nice striped sweater. It was difficult to make out all that was going on as the snow’s volume increased, which was probably why Leckrone conducted from the top of a step ladder, which helpers periodically moved to different points on the field. There was “Hey! Baby,” “Tequila,” “The Time Warp” and, of course, “You’ve Said It All.” The crowd stood and swayed on cue. The sousaphone players formed a line. Mel Rush, a sophomore, said her fellow band members enjoyed the Fifth Quarter as much as the spectators did. Though choreographed, it is their most recreational activity. “After a long week of working, going out to a game — you just take out your stress,” she said. This held true even though she insisted she had the most difficult job: As a cymbal player, she is periodically required to perform “flips,” in which she flicks her wrists, stylishly rotating the crash cymbals, which are metal discs that cannot help brushing against her sleeve. “It’s the hardest thing in the cold,” she said.
