The International Olympic Committee said there was a choice of 12 bobsled and luge tracks around the world that could host events for the 2018 Winter Olympics if the sliding site was moved out of South Korea. I.O.C. officials said they were in talks with organizers of the Pyeongchang Games about relocating the sliding sports to another country to save money and avoid leaving South Korea with a venue that it has little use for after the Games.
