Matthews made six 3-pointers and finished with 28 points, leading the  Matthews, who leads the N.B.A. with 106 3-pointers this season — and punctuates the shots by shooting an imaginary arrow — made five 3s in the first half against the Knicks. His teammate Nicolas Batum had five 3-pointers and finished with 17 points. The Blazers made 16 of 36 from long range. They have made at least 10 3s in five of their last six games. The loss was the eighth straight for the Knicks, who had just nine players available at the game’s start and then lost Carmelo Anthony for the second half because of a sore left knee. Cole Aldrich had 12 points and a career-high 19 rebounds for the Knicks, and Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 17 points. SUNS 116, LAKERS 107 “They’ve got one on the left, one on the right and one in the middle,” Bryant said. “You can’t cover them all.” With Goran Dragic, Eric Bledsoe and Isaiah Thomas on the floor together in the final minutes, the Suns had more than enough options to keep their winning streak rolling. Dragic scored 24 points, Bledsoe had 20 of his 22 after halftime, and visiting Phoenix beat Los Angeles on Sunday night for the Suns’ sixth consecutive victory. The Lakers lost their third straight despite Bryant’s return. He had 10 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists in 32 minutes in his first game back from a three-game absence to rest his body.
