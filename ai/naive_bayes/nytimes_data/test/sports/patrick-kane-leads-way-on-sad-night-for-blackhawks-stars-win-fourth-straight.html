Playing with heavy hearts, Patrick Kane and the  Kane had a power-play goal and two assists, leading Antti Raanta and the Blackhawks to a 4-0 victory over the visiting Toronto Maple Leafs on Sunday night. The Blackhawks played with a “CR” decal on their helmets after the assistant equipment manager Clint Reif died earlier in the day. “We’re still in disbelief,” the team captain Jonathan Toews said. “The fact we went out there and played the way we did, I think we dedicated that one to our good friend Clint. “I’m glad we got the win tonight.” Reif, 34, was “found to be unresponsive in his home” on Sunday morning, according to a statement from the DuPage County Coroner’s Office. Authorities are investigating the death, and the coroner’s office declined further comment. Raanta made 31 saves for his second shutout of the season, helping Chicago rebound from a 3-2 shootout loss Saturday night in Columbus. “I commend the guys,” Coach Joel Quenneville said. “Very emotional, draining day. To come up and play such a solid game, from Antti right on out, they played the right way.” David Rundblad, Kris Versteeg and Toews also scored, and Patrick Sharp had three assists as the Blackhawks won for the 14th time in their last 17 games. Chicago has just one regulation loss in its last 13 games. STARS 6, OILERS 5 Shawn Horcoff had the winning score in the eighth round of the tiebreaker and collected his fifth goal in the first period. Erik Cole and Jamie Benn also scored in regulation for the visiting Stars, who have won five of six. Taylor Hall and Mark Arcobello each had two goals for the Oilers, who blew a 5-2 lead. AVALANCHE 2, RED WINGS 1  Nathan MacKinnon and Matt Duchene also scored in the tiebreaker as Colorado ended a three-game trip with 5 points. Gustav Nyquist and Tomas Tatar had shootout goals for Detroit, which fell to 1-7 in the tiebreaker. BRUINS 4, SABRES 3 Dougie Hamilton scored twice for Boston, including a tying goal with 1:31 left in the third after the Bruins pulled goalie Tuukka Rask. Buffalo could not quite hang on after holding a 3-2 lead for most of the third period on Tim Schaller’s first N.H.L. goal.
