Mikaela Shiffrin Looks Beyond Slalom to Overall Title
In her dreams, the American teenager sees herself not just winning during this World Cup season, but dominating.

BOSTON — If all goes according to plan Saturday at the opening slalom race of the World Cup season in Levi, Finland, Mikaela Shiffrin will walk away with a reindeer, the unconventional prize traditionally awarded to the winner, and kick off her march toward history. “Right now, the goal is Levi and I’d like to defend my title there. They’re still doing the reindeer prize, and hopefully I’ll get another reindeer,” said Shiffrin, who won last year’s race by over a second and collected her prize, a six-month-old fawn she named Rudolph. (Rudolph now lives on a farm near Levi.) With her impressive success at such a young age, Shiffrin, 19, has emerged as the face of a new generation of skiers who are starting to dominate the sport. Last season, all the women’s World Cup titles — except for the downhill — were won by a someone 24 or younger. Anna Fenninger,  25, of Austria, won the 2014 overall and giant slalom titles, as well as gold in the super-G and silver in giant slalom at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia.  Lara Gut, 23, of Switzerland, won the super-G title and took Olympic bronze in the downhill. Shiffrin won the World Cup slalom title, her second, by winning five of her eight races in the discipline. Several veteran icons, including Maria Höfl-Riesch of Germany and Marlies Schild of Austria, retired after the 2014 season. In a moment emblematic of the shift toward youth, Shiffrin became the youngest gold medalist in slalom by edging her childhood idol, Schild, 33, at the Olympics in February. “It’s inevitable that the next generation is going to come up,” Shiffrin said. While there have always been child prodigies, the newest generation has benefited from advances in sports science and has built on the experience of the athletes before them. “It took me many years to figure out what was good for me and what made me strong,” said Schild, who holds the women’s record with 35 slalom victories. “The younger skiers coming up now, they see what we have done, what I have done, and maybe it helps them know what to do.” Roland Pfeifer, the United States ski team’s women’s technical coach, believes the younger generation takes a more professional and individualized approach to the sport, which has allowed many of them, such as Shiffrin, to experience so much success at such a young age. “They kind of have their own specialists, their own slalom coach, downhill coach, P.T.s,” or personal trainers, said Pfeifer. “Ten years ago, there was just one conditioning coach for 15 ladies.” Shiffrin, now in her fourth World Cup season, also has a World Championship gold and 17 top-three finishes to go with her other titles. She has loftier objectives this season than just a slalom title. “The goal is to win as many races as I can. I have this dream of winning every race in a single discipline in a season. Nobody’s ever done that before,” said Shiffrin in a telephone interview from her home in Eagle-Vail, Colo. Shiffrin is already off to a strong start. Three weeks ago at the first race of the World Cup season, a giant slalom in Sölden, Austria, she tied for victory with  Fenninger, the reigning World Cup overall and giant slalom champion. It was Shiffrin’s first win in an event other than slalom and a step toward establishing herself as a multidiscipline threat and serious contender for the overall trophy, which measures a racer’s success across all five disciplines over a season. To win the overall trophy, Shiffrin must consistently achieve the podium in slalom and in at least one other event, which will most likely be G.S., as it is the discipline the most similar to slalom. That’s how Marcel Hirscher of Austria has taken the World Cup overall title for the past three years. “If I ski to my potential in slalom and G.S. and hopefully super-G, then the overall will be a possibility,” she said. This season, Shiffrin will make her debut in the speed disciplines. According to  Pfeifer, the United States ski team’s technical coach, Shiffrin plans to compete in her first World Cup super-G in Val d’Isère, France, in December, followed possibly by the super-G in Bad Kleinkirchheim, Austria, and a combined event featuring a super-G leg in Bansko, Bulgaria, in March. Not only will these speed races give her a better shot at the overall, but the events in France and Austria will also offer her the chance to qualify to compete in the super-G at the World Championships in February in Beaver Creek, Colo., where she also plans to race slalom and giant slalom. According to Pfeifer, Shiffrin’s super-G skiing is so strong at the moment that he believes she has the ability to beat Lindsey Vonn, one of the fastest female speed skiers in history, who is likely to return to competition in December after nearly two years away from the slopes due to a knee injury she sustained in 2013. “Definitely she can beat Vonn, especially in the technical super-Gs like Beaver Creek. If Mikaela didn’t think she had a chance to win, we would not start racing super-G now,” Pfeifer said.
