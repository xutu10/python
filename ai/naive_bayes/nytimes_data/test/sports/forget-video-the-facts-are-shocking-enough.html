Ray Rice Footage Prompts Roger Goodell’s Action
Video of Ray Rice punching his then-fiancée made the assault seem worse, but the facts alone should be enough in any domestic violence case.
===
Did N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell see the video of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice cold-cocking his fiancée in an Atlantic City elevator before that video appeared on the Internet on Monday? Did he know just how nauseating it is to see a man crumple a woman with a single, almost nonchalant blow before he penalized Rice with a spineless two-game suspension? Does it really matter if he did? The league claimed on Monday that Goodell hadn’t seen  After he appeared to spit on her. After he shoved her. And before Rice stood by, doing nothing, as she sat up, seeming dazed as another man appeared to console her and help her to her feet. Those vivid details of that night last winter are sickening. But you know what? None of those new details matter. Not a single one. Of course the video made the assault seem worse, and naturally it sparked a tidal wave of  But the facts alone should be enough in any domestic violence case. When a man or a woman pushes a spouse down a flight of stairs or takes a frying pan to a lover’s head, do we really need to see video evidence to realize that the act was wrong and cruel, or to adequately punish the offender? Based on the Rice case, it looks as if that’s true. Just after lunch on Monday — seven long months after the assault, but a few short hours after the video of it went public — Rice was cut by the Ravens. Soon after, Goodell announced that Rice had been suspended indefinitely by the N.F.L. All because of a video. But it never should have taken this long. Not long after the assault, the police investigated and determined that Rice had knocked out Palmer. An earlier video showed Rice dragging Palmer out of the elevator as if he were hauling a trash bag to the curb. That alone should have been enough for the N.F.L. to suspend Rice for a good, long time, or for the Ravens to get rid of him. It should have prompted the league to send a message to other players — as well as to its fans — that domestic violence will not be tolerated. But Rice was a star, and excuses are made for stars. Rice’s lawyers and the N.F.L. hinted that there were reasons for his aggression. That both Rice and his fiancée were at fault. Maybe she smacked her head on the floor and gave herself a concussion. Still, she and Rice had worked it out — after all, they got married afterward — so everything surely was O.K. None of the facts surrounding a player assaulting his fiancée were so discomfiting as to stop the Ravens from hosting Rice’s news conference in May, when he apologized to everyone: his coaches, team officials, fans. Everyone but the woman he had punched, who was sitting right next to him. Janay Rice, who said she loved her husband even though her body language didn’t show it, made it hard not to wince when she apologized for “the role that she played the night of the incident.” Yet the Ravens were fine with it, allowing Rice to sit all spiffy in a suit and tie, in front of a banner dotted with their logos, and thank his supporters for “teaching him what it is to be a man.” But the TMZ video should be a reminder that some men still have a lot to learn. Some still think it’s acceptable to use women as punching bags. In casino elevators. In suburban living rooms. On Super Bowl Sunday, maybe over a team’s loss. On game days, after too many drinks. Police logs sometimes tell the story. On rare occasions, a video tells the story. Most of the time, no one is there to tell the story. So when the league has the chance to punish the violent, it should act swiftly and surely, knowing that millions, including its players, are watching. Late last month, Goodell promised he would do just that. He said he “didn’t get it right” when he  Maybe we need to see him saying it on video to believe him.
