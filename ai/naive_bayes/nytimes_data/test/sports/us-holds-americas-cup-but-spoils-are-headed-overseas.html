U.S. Holds Cup but Won’t Be Host 
Instead of meeting the challenge on its home waters, the United States team elected to do so in Bermuda.

The America’s Cup has generated some strange partnerships and situations in its 163 years. A yacht club from landlocked Switzerland once won the Cup in New Zealand with a crew full of New Zealanders. Another Cup match was an unfair fight between a big, single-hulled boat and a nimble, wing-masted catamaran. But Tuesday provided one of the oddest plot twists in the long-running story line of the event, sailing’s most prestigious, as an American team chose — with no outside pressure — to defend the Cup outside the United States. Larry Ellison This was a first for an American team. And it was only more symbolic that the announcement came in New York, home to the New York Yacht Club, which zealously kept the Cup in the United States for 132 years. “I think it’s a curious choice,” said Gary Jobson, a former Cup sailor who is now a broadcaster. “It’s not in the United States, which I find very disappointing as a past president of US Sailing. The whole thing makes me scratch my head.” Bermuda has long caused sailors concern — consider the Triangle — but the worries this time are that it offers too small a commercial base for teams in search of sponsors and too small a fan base, with its population of 65,000 perched on a group of islands in the North Atlantic Ocean. Bermuda is a fine and picturesque place for a sailboat race. It has a rich maritime history and is already the finish line of the Newport-Bermuda Race, held every two years. Many of the Cup’s stars, including Ainslie and Oracle’s skipper, James Spithill, know the islands and their waters well. But shipping the Cup to Bermuda certainly does not seem like the ideal route to building big interest in the event in the United States, which was one of Ellison’s stated goals before the last edition. Oracle’s historic comeback against Emirates Team New Zealand, in which it rallied from an 8-1 deficit by winning eight straight races, generated real buzz at home as well as abroad. But instead of riding that wave in San Francisco, Ellison and Russell Coutts, Oracle Team USA’s chief executive, have chosen to start anew in a British overseas territory — as close as the British have come to staging the Cup since they lost the inaugural regatta at home off the Isle of Wight in 1851. “Well, we’re halfway there,” said Ben Ainslie, a British yachtsman who sailed for Ellison in 2013 but is now the head of a British team, Ben Ainslie Racing. Moving the race closer to Europe was a major reason for choosing Bermuda, Coutts said, as was the territory’s proposal to build a central base for teams and spectators. For now, there are five confirmed challengers for the 2017 Cup: Team New Zealand, Ben Ainslie Racing, Artemis, Luna Rossa and Team France. Four of those teams are from Europe. Finding the right time zone for European television “was absolutely critical to us,” Coutts said in an interview Tuesday. An East Coast location in the United States — Newport, R.I., was briefly considered — would certainly have checked off some of the television boxes, too. Bermuda is, after all, just one time zone closer to Europe and still four hours behind Britain and five hours behind most of Continental Europe. Yet Coutts said he believed that starting the racing at 3 p.m. in Bermuda would be a fine fit for global broadcasters and that Bermuda would be a convenient, meet-in-the-middle point for sponsors and spectators from Europe and the United States. Scheduling the Cup in June also takes it outside the N.F.L. season in the United States and the heart of the club soccer season in Europe. Coutts, the most successful skipper in the Cup’s history, has clearly learned some lessons after helping pick a September date last time around. Perhaps more than anyone, he symbolizes the global nature of the modern Cup. A star for New Zealand, he was one of the top sailors who left to join Alinghi, the Swiss syndicate that took the Cup from Team New Zealand in 2003.  He then helped pick Valencia, Spain, as the site for the 2007 Cup, with the Swiss in need of a location on the sea. He said that taking the next Cup out of the United States had been “an important decision, but I don’t think it was a hard decision, in light of all the factors.” Coutts added, speaking of the Golden Gate Yacht Club in San Francisco: “You could view this very narrowly and say it’s best for us to host the event right outside our yacht club, and our members can sit out on the yacht club balcony and watch the race. Or you can sit back and say, actually, we’ve got to make sure broadcast works for the overseas teams, and we better make sure that some of the other key conditions around the event work as a whole.” Coutts rejected the suggestion that Bermuda’s gentle tax rates had played an important part in the choice. “It wasn’t even a factor in our consideration frankly,” he said. But the bottom line is clearly a big factor, as the decision not to return to San Francisco made plain. Even Ellison, with all his billions, surely wants to cut his losses.  Coutts said: “I call it creating more fiscal responsibility, because really we could, I guess, choose to rely on wealthy individuals who keep putting their hands up and providing the funding for this. That’s one model you could select, and some people would believe that’s sustainable and that could go on and on, and someone will always be prepared to pay for it. But our way of thinking is that we need to make this work better for the teams and for the owners to be truly sustainable on a longer term.” This Cup still proved too rich for the Hamilton Island Yacht Club in Australia, which withdrew its challenge this year. And though Team France, Team New Zealand and Ainslie’s team were well represented at Tuesday’s news conference in New York, all are still in search of the necessary funding. If they make it, at least they can take comfort in knowing they won’t have to compete in hostile waters against the defender. In this Cup, nobody will be sailing at home.
