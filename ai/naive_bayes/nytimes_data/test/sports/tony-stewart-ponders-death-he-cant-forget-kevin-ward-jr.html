Tony Stewart Ponders a Death He Can’t Forget

KANNAPOLIS, N.C. —  Tony Stewart has been exonerated in the sprint-car accident that killed the driver Kevin Ward Jr. at Canandaigua Motorsports Park in upstate New York on Aug. 9. He may be cleared, but a soft-spoken Stewart said Monday that he was not past the anguish he has lived with since that night. In his first news conference since the accident, and less than a week after a grand jury in Ontario County, N.Y., declined to indict him, Stewart, 43, sat on a dais inside his Stewart-Haas Racing shop and answered questions for more than 30 minutes. He addressed everything from the dark days after the accident to his return to the Sprint Cup series on Aug. 31. “I think about it a lot every day,” Stewart said of the accident, which occurred during an open-wheel sprint-car race at a dirt track not far from a Cup event scheduled at Watkins Glen International on Aug. 10. “That’s the great thing about getting back in the racecar, because it gives me time to forget about it for a minute and to stop thinking about it. After you get done at the end of the day, you start thinking about it again. It’s not something that goes away.  “It will never go away.  It’s always going to be part of my life, the rest of my life. That’s the unfortunate part.” The accident came after Ward, while racing next to Stewart, crashed into the outside wall. Ward exited his racecar and walked onto the track, confronting Stewart as he drove by on the next lap. Ward was killed when Stewart’s racecar struck him. Stewart did not take questions Monday regarding the specifics of the accident. He could still face a civil suit from Ward’s family. But Stewart said he was relieved the criminal case was over. “Anytime you’re facing something like that and your fate is in someone else’s hands, it’s natural to be fearful,” he said. “But all along, I knew what the facts are. I knew what had happened.” Stewart had little reaction to the toxicology report that indicated Ward was under the influence of marijuana that night. “It was still a tragic accident,” he said. “I just know in my heart that it was a hundred percent an accident; that detail didn’t mean anything to me personally.” Asked if he would have done anything different that night, Stewart said, “I’d have stayed at Watkins Glen that night.” A three-time Cup champion and long a fan favorite in racing, Stewart went into seclusion after the accident. He sought professional help to deal with grief. And he did not race for three weeks before returning in Atlanta. “All you thought about is what happened and asking yourself why,” he said. “Why did this happen? So you just sat there for entire days on end asking questions and trying to come to terms with what happened and why it happened.” Stewart said he had also spent some time reading about the criticism he faced from some following the accident. Many turned to social media to blame Stewart for Ward’s death. But Stewart found support inside the Nascar community. Many in the garage privately reached out to him. When he returned to racing, he received an ovation from fans in Atlanta during prerace introductions. Stewart even joked about fans mistaking him for the popular driver Dale Earnhardt Jr., a rare moment of levity during the news conference. “At first I thought I accidentally walked out in Dale Jr.’s spot,” he said, “but it was very overwhelming.” Stewart has not reached out to Ward’s family but said he would talk to them if they wanted. In the meantime, Stewart said he was not certain he would return to racing sprint cars. It has been a hobby for years that brought him back to his roots. But he said that he had never considered quitting Nascar or retiring as a driver. On the contrary, Stewart said he was encouraged by his performance at Dover International Speedway on Sunday, when he finished 14th in the AAA 400. He is not in the playoff this season, which was looking like a long shot for Stewart even before the accident. “This is what I’ve done all my life,” he said as the Cup series shifts to Kansas Speedway this weekend. “This is what I’ve done for 36 years, and I wouldn’t change anything about it. I love what I do.  I love driving racecars, but I think it might change right now as far as how much of it and what I do, but there was never a thought in my head about stopping. That would take the life out of me.”
