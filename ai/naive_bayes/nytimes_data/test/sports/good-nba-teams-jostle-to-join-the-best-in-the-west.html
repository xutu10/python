Good N.B.A. Teams Jostle to Join the Best in the West
A percolating class of teams is trying to break up the dominance of the Spurs and the Thunder in the Western Conference, where there is a reasonable chance that teams will need 50 wins just to make it to the playoffs.
===
Once again, the N.B.A.’s Western Conference is so deep that there is a reasonable chance it will take 50 wins just to make the playoffs. In the Eastern Conference, only the Cavaliers and the Bulls are expected to win as many as 50. Despite the relative parity out west, the  The narrow margins between these teams and the stakes of moving up one or two playoff spots to gain home-court advantage have created some of the league’s most passionate rivalries. The only team the Clippers dislike more than the Grizzlies is the Warriors, who really can’t stand the Rockets, the team that feuded with the Mavericks this off-season. Each team is searching for a way to break from the pack. The conference’s two incumbent superpowers offer competing models for reaching the top. The Thunder have the best player in the conference in Kevin Durant, the league’s most valuable player last season. They also have the all-N.B.A. point guard Russell Westbrook, and they use their speed and talent to bludgeon their opponents into submission. The Spurs may not have the best player, although they have plenty of talent, and they certainly have the best system. It has taken many seasons for Coach Gregg Popovich to acquire pieces, like Boris Diaw and Danny Green, that perfectly complement the core of Tim Duncan and Tony Parker, and to install a system that maximizes everyone’s ability. Unseating the Thunder and the Spurs means overcoming incomparable talent or surpassing a culture and a system 15 seasons in the making. Getting ahead of either team can be compared to running a marathon at a full sprint. The Clippers appear best suited to challenge for the top spot. In terms of talent, Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, now in their third season together, are the best one-two punch this side of Durant and Westbrook. The Clippers should also enjoy a measure of continuity. With the disgraced former owner Donald Sterling gone and Coach Doc Rivers in his second season, the Clippers have established an identity but have sputtered in the playoffs, when the stress and intensity of the postseason can cause even the most talented teams to crack. The other five teams that made the playoffs last year would bristle at the notion that they have not moved closer to contention. The Mavericks brought back Tyson Chandler and signed Chandler Parsons; both moves will make them more athletic. Dirk Nowitzki remains one of the most difficult players to cover with just one defender, and a better defense could lead to a repeat of their improbable run to the 2011 title. Unlike the Mavericks, the Trail Blazers and the Rockets were relatively quiet in the off-season, and are counting on the natural maturation of their stars. At some point, James Harden and Dwight Howard of the Rockets and Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge of the Trail Blazers must prove they can outgun the conference’s other star pairings. Although the Rockets and the Trail Blazers have committed to building through their stars, it is unclear if they have found a recipe for a 50-win season, let alone a run to the finals. And neither team can be regarded as particularly deep. In contrast, the Warriors and the Grizzlies have committed their resources to premium role players. Favorable contracts to key players — Stephen Curry for the Warriors and Mike Conley for the Grizzlies — have allowed them to spend more freely on the margins. The Grizzlies and the Warriors have unorthodox profiles. The Grizzlies play a brutal brand of disruptive defense: Marc Gasol deftly handles the interior while the thieving hands of Conley and his fellow backcourt pest Tony Allen frustrate opponents on the perimeter. When Gasol was healthy last season, the Grizzlies won at the pace of a 56-win team. They hope that good health and an influx of shooting from the free-agent signee Vince Carter will take them to the next level. The Warriors may have been the team whose coaching staff left the most wins on the table last season. It’s up to Steve Kerr, Golden State’s first-year coach, to maximize a talented but unconventional roster. Each of these teams faces major questions and must be careful that efforts to address weaknesses do not backfire. Improving at the margins is difficult because a roster that can win 50 or more games usually has no glaring weaknesses. Although the path forward is fraught with potential perils, these teams are far from being in a bad position. An
