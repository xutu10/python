MADISON, Wis. — Wisconsin running back and Heisman Trophy finalist Melvin Gordon made it official Wednesday, skipping his senior season to enter the NFL draft. Unlike the departure of coach Gary Andersen for Oregon State, this move was expected in Madison. Gordon has run for a Big Ten record 2,336 yards going into the Outback Bowl on Jan. 1, when the 17th-ranked Badgers will face No. 19 Auburn. When asked on the Dan Patrick radio show Wednesday morning if he was not returning to Wisconsin following the bowl game, Gordon laughed and just said “Yup.” Andersen left the school later Wednesday. Wisconsin athletic director Barry Alvarez said he thought that “everybody was well aware that Melvin was going to go into the draft,” but that Andersen’s departure was shocking to the team.
