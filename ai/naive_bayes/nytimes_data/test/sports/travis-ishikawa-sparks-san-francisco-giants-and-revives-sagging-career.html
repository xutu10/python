Travis Ishikawa Sparks San Francisco Giants and Revives Sagging Career
The Giants are being defined by players such as Ishikawa, a journeyman who had been contemplating retirement but who has made the most of an unexpected opportunity.

ST. LOUIS —  When Travis Ishikawa arrived at the ballpark on Sept. 25, the last Thursday of the regular season, he looked at the lineup card and blinked. Over parts of seven seasons in the major leagues, he had never started anywhere in the field other than first base. “I just came in and saw my name in the starting lineup in left field and had to look at it three or four times to make sure I’d seen it right,” Ishikawa said, smiling. As he described that unlikely scene, Ishikawa was immersed in another one — surrounded by a group of reporters Saturday night after helping the  The Giants are striving for their third World Series title in five seasons, and they are doing so with a group of familiar characters: the baby-faced catcher Buster Posey, the unpredictable third baseman Pablo Sandoval, the overcaffeinated right fielder Hunter Pence and the unflappable ace Madison Bumgarner. They all played prominent roles in the Game 1 victory. But these Giants also are being defined by players like Ishikawa, who have been handed unexpected opportunities as a result of injuries to teammates and have made the most of them. Over the second half of the season, the Giants have lost four seemingly crucial pieces — pitcher Matt Cain, their former staff anchor; second baseman Marco Scutaro, the catalyst for their offense and the N.L.C.S. most valuable player in 2012; and outfielders Angel Pagan, their leadoff man, and Mike Morse, their biggest power threat behind Posey. All are gone for the season except Morse, who has just returned after missing more than a month with a strained oblique. Nevertheless, the Giants are in a familiar place — a team rolling through October. The rookie Joe Panik has filled in exceedingly well at second base, batting .345 since Aug. 4; a revived Jake Peavy — acquired from Boston at the July trade deadline — has taken Cain’s place; Gregor Blanco has moved into Pagan’s place in center field and at the top of the lineup; and Ishikawa has replaced Morse. “We’re not full strength, but guys have stepped in and done a great job,” Giants Manager Bruce Bochy said. “That’s what it takes.” Of the replacements, Ishikawa may have been the most unlikely. Panik, 23, is a former first-round pick from St. John’s, Peavy is a former Cy Young Award winner and Blanco’s defense would very likely have earned him a role as a late-inning replacement. But earlier this season, Ishikawa was mulling retirement. He started at first base for the Pirates on opening day but was released at the end of April when they acquired Ike Davis. He signed a minor-league contract with the Giants, the team he came up with. But when he found himself sitting on the bench at Class AAA Fresno in June, the burden of a career that appeared to be flat lining weighed heavily on him. Ishikawa had spent 2013 mostly in the minor leagues and with four teams — including a one-game stint with the Yankees — and saw his wife and three children for a total of 14 days from Feb. 1 to Sept. 1. “Any time you struggle this late in your career in the minor leagues — there were some times I wasn’t even playing — I didn’t’ know if it was worth it to be a bench guy in Triple A,” said Ishikawa, who recently turned 31. “So, yeah, there’s been times where I’ve thought about retirement. Thank God I stuck with it.” Ishikawa bought an outfielder’s glove in 2009 but never got around to using it much, even for shagging fly balls in batting practice. He had not played the outfield regularly since he was a sophomore in high school. But as he sat on the bench in Fresno, he told his manager, Bob Mariano, that he could play the outfield — and so he did, getting 12 starts. By the end of July, he was back with the Giants. By the end of August, Morse was hurt. By mid-September, so was Pagan. Blanco, who regularly replaced Morse for defense, was the first to fill in. In late September, Bochy turned to Juan Perez, another excellent defensive player, and the rookie Chris Dominguez, a September call-up, but they both hit well below .200 and the Giants’ offense struggled. Ishikawa at least was a dependable bat with playoff experience. “We felt like we needed a little bit more offense and he was our best option,” said Bochy, who had looked for new left fielders late in 2010 and 2012 when Jose Guillen and Melky Cabrera were given drug suspensions. “We worked him pretty hard out in the outfield before we put him there, and once he went out there, he started taking great routes.” One of those routes came Saturday night. Ishikawa already had two singles — the first one driving in the Giants’ first run — when the Cardinals’ Yadier Molina laced a ball into the left-center field gap with two outs and a runner at first. Ishikawa closed on the liner and gloved it as he dived to the turf, Molina throwing his bat down. Bumgarner noted that Ishikawa was wearing Mike Trout model spikes and now seemed to be playing like the All-Star outfielder. Bochy, who kept Morse on the bench to start the series, figured that Ishikawa, who had started five of the six playoff games, would ask him why he was replaced for defense. Blanco said he thought Ishikawa would have a harder time. He has not made an error, either at first base or in the outfield, in 144 chances this season. For his part, Ishikawa admitted that the dive might not have been necessary. He was worried about tripping and kicking the ball loose, so he just let his momentum carry him. It has been his only flop so far.
