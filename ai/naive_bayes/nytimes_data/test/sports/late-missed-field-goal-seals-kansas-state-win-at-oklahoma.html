Michael Hunnicutt missed a 19-yard field goal late as No. 14 Kansas State held off No. 11 Oklahoma, 31-30, in Norman, Okla., on Saturday afternoon. Oklahoma, trailing by a point in the fourth quarter, drove to the Kansas State 1-yard line, but could not punch the ball in. Hunnicutt then missed the short field goal that would have put  Hunnicutt, hailed as an all-America candidate before the season, missed a total of two short field-goal attempts and had an extra-point attempt blocked. Jake Waters passed for 225 yards and two touchdown passes for the Wildcats, who defeated the Sooners by 24-19 two years ago on their previous trip to Norman. Oklahoma’s Sterling Shepard tied a university record with 15 catches for 197 yards and Trevor Knight passed for 318 yards and three touchdown passes for Oklahoma (5-2, 2-2). SYRACUSE 30, WAKE FOREST 7 Robert Welsh returned an interception 42 yards for a touchdown and Micah Robinson scored on a 51-yard fumble return to give Syracuse its first win since Sept. 13 when they beat Eastern Michigan. The Orange (3-4, 1-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) knocked out Wake Forest’s starting quarterback, John Wolford, in the second quarter, rendering the Demon Deacons’ (2-5, 0-3) already struggling offense even more ineffective. His replacement, Tyler Cameron, was benched in the fourth quarter. MARYLAND 38, IOWA 31 The Terrapins (5-2, 2-1) scored 24 straight points after falling behind by two touchdowns with eight and a half minutes elapsed. It was 24-21 before Likely picked off a Jake Rudock pass and sprinted untouched into the end zone with 12:29 left. Stefon Diggs caught nine passes for 130 yards and a touchdown for Maryland, playing its first season in the Big Ten after leaving the Atlantic Coast Conference. Iowa fell to 5-2, 2-1. MINNESOTA 39, PURDUE 38 Cedric Thompson had two interceptions for Minnesota (6-1, 3-0), including a diving pickoff of Austin Appleby with 2:28 remaining to seal it. This was the first time in 23 games under Coach Jerry Kill that the Gophers rallied from a halftime deficit to win. Appleby threw three first-half touchdown passes for the Boilermakers (3-5, 1-3), but he was only 4 for 10 for 18 yards in the second half.
