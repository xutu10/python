Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski, whose critical, entertaining and fashion-conscious figure skating analysis on NBCSN drew praise during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, have earned an expected promotion to the lead team for the sport on the NBC Sports Group. NBC “Tara and Johnny are a very authentic team,” Jim Bell, the executive producer of NBC Olympics, said in a telephone interview. “They’re fun and fresh. They’re not afraid to offer strong opinions and come back and take a selfie on Instagram.” He added: “You look for their kind of chemistry. You can’t make it up.” Lipinski and Weir will be the prime-time voices of figure skating for NBC during the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, but will start in their new roles during the NBC broadcast of Skate America on Sunday. They are replacing Scott Hamilton, the 1984 Olympic men’s ice skating gold medalist who began calling the Winter Olympics for CBS in 1992, and Sandra Bezic.

Weir and Lipinski’s ascent was first reported last month when Hamilton, Bezic and Hammond told The Chicago Tribune of the changes. Bell said he had not decided if another team would be formed to call figure skating on NBCSN. He did not rule out double duty for Lipinski and Weir, who could be calling figure skating for NBC until its Olympics rights deals end in 2032.
