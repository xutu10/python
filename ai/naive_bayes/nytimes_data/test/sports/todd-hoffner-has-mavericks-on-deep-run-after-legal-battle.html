Todd Hoffner Has Mavericks on Deep Run After Legal Battle
University administrators and players did not want Todd Hoffner to return after he had spent two years away from the team mired in a legal controversy, but his first year back has been full of success.

MANKATO, Minn. —  Todd Hoffner tossed around footballs and joked with his players as the Minnesota State Mavericks prepared for their playoff game on Saturday against a familiar instate rival, Minnesota-Duluth. It was 21 degrees, the practice field was frozen and the head coach was trying to keep his team’s motor running. “Where my dogs at?” Hoffner barked loudly when he wanted one of his players to retrieve a football. “Where are your shorts?” he teased another, even though he himself was bundled in a Mavericks coat The jovial mood underscored a good moment for Minnesota State. The Mavericks are undefeated, and top-ranked in the national N.C.A.A. Division II poll. With three more wins, they can earn their first national championship. Better, Hoffner is a changed man, with a team that finally is behind him. Eight months ago, this was unthinkable. During spring practice, Hoffner’s players refused to take the field with him after a legal nightmare kept him absent from the team for two years. His troubles began in August 2012, when he was charged with two felony counts of child pornography after one of the college’s technicians discovered naked videos of his young children on his university-issued smartphone. The revelation came on the heels of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal and quickly gained national attention. Minnesota State officials removed Hoffner as coach and put him on administrative leave. By December 2012, a judge dismissed the charges, ruling that the videos of the children amounted to nothing more than them dancing naked and acting silly after a bath. In an interview in his office this week, Hoffner, 48, said it took him a week after the ruling to make up his mind to take his old job back. He knew it wouldn’t be easy, but he felt it was part of the “restorative justice” that he had sought after being charged and banished from the team and the university. “If I didn’t come back to this situation, I would have always second-guessed why I didn’t come back,” said Hoffner. “If you know you are right and you truly believe you haven’t done wrong and you want to try to make yourself whole again, you have to go back into the fray.” But university officials were not eager to welcome him back, first reassigning him and then firing him altogether. It took a lengthy legal battle, but in April an arbitrator decided that Hoffner had been wrongfully terminated and ordered his reinstatement. The university publicly apologized to Hoffner, but there was no playbook to follow for when a successful former football coach reclaims his job after a drawn-out public dispute, and must coexist with the administrators who ousted him. Minnesota State’s president, Richard Davenport, citing privacy laws, declined a request for an interview. In a statement, he said that he has tried to make the return as smooth as possible. “I admire Todd’s positive attitude and his leadership in taking the team forward toward a national championship this year,” he wrote, adding, “I’ve pledged my full support to Todd, the team and the athletic department.” Soon after announcing his return to Minnesota State in a tearful news conference, Hoffner went to work winning over his players, many of whom he had recruited. “It was tough sledding,” he said of the early days. While Hoffner was sidelined, one of his top assistants, Aaron Keen, led the Mavericks to a 24-2 record. He was everything that Hoffner wasn’t — easygoing and approachable. In April, in a show of loyalty to Keen, the team boycotted the first spring practice. The next morning, Hoffner called all the players and coaches to a team meeting and asked them to offer complaints and questions in an attempt to clear the air. Keen was there as well. “It was a tremendous opportunity for people to vent, to share their displeasures and things that were on their mind and ask questions — and, you know, shoot bullet holes in me, if you will,” he said. Kevin Buisman, Minnesota State’s athletic director, said the team meeting was a turning point for the players and the program. The next month, Keen left to become an assistant coach at Eastern Michigan University. “They had been through a lot,” Buisman said. “Coach Keen had provided excellent leadership and they had grown accustomed to his coaching style. I understand the sense of anxiety and frustration about another change in circumstances.” One thing that unified the Mavericks, who finished 13-1 in 2013, was their intent to win a national title this season. “Not five minutes into that meeting, those players wanted to make sure that Coach Hoffner was on board with their goal of a national championship,” Buisman said. Shortly after the meeting, Hoffner put a sign-up sheet on his office door and asked his players to make appointments for one-on-one sessions. One of his seniors, Keyvan Rudd, told Hoffner that he and his teammates didn’t want his return to “change the way people look at our program.” “I’m here to play football,” Rudd told him. “I’m a senior. I’m ready to help lead these guys. And I want you to understand that things have changed around here.” The players also asked Hoffner to adjust his style. In building the program, Hoffner acknowledged that he had to “rule with a stern iron fist.” This season, it was time to loosen his grip. He empowered his assistants to be more hands-on with the players while he managed the program from above. “I’m not as crazy,” said Hoffner, laughing. So, for one of the finest autumns ever for Minnesota football, the focus has remained on the field — and not on who was or was not on the sideline. The Mavericks opened their season with a 31-0 win over St. Cloud State. Last Saturday they beat Pittsburg State, 24-21, in overtime. Now the Minnesota State faithful are thinking that this could be a team of destiny rather than controversy. “Winning is very important and has been very important in this process,” Hoffner said. “It would have been very easy to point the finger at me.”
