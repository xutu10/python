A Boy’s Injury Rallies a County
A community in Indiana came together after an 11-year-old sustained a severe head injury during a game.
===
HAYDEN, Ind. — Erin Stoner, a teacher at Hayden Elementary School, gave the information to her sixth-grade class straight, without sugarcoating it or tiptoeing around it. One of the students’ classmates, Calvin Clark, had just sustained a severe head injury during a football game. She felt obliged to tell them the truth. “Calvin hurt his brain, and he’s hasn’t woken up yet,” she recalled telling them two days after the injury, which happened early this month. “I’m not going to tell you that he’ll be O.K. because I don’t know that. It’s too early to say.” One of their vocabulary words was “responsive,” so Mrs. Stoner talked about what that meant, as in, “Calvin is not responsive.” Eleven- and 12-year-olds asked questions like “When will he be back?” and “Will he remember me?” She wanted to provide answers but could say only, “I just don’t know, guys.” She explained that Calvin, who is 11, had an operation to repair a burst blood vessel in his brain and that the first 72 hours were crucial. The children counted the minutes. “It’s been 36 hours — halfway!” one said to her, and Mrs. Stoner responded with an assuring nod. But, really, it’s been as if all of Jennings County has been holding its breath as it watches the clock’s hands tick by. Maybe people in Jennings, in southeastern Indiana, knew that 2014 had been particularly deadly for football players, and that the deaths of nine high school players had been attributed directly to football. Maybe they didn’t know. Perhaps they had long thought that those tragedies happened in other towns, to other families, to other children. But this time, without warning, the issue of football safety has landed directly on their doorstep, in this close-knit community where many people know one another and work on farms or in factories. It was a marvel to see how people in this county of about 28,500 — including the 6,728 in North Vernon, Calvin’s hometown and the big city here — rallied to help one of their own. Within hours of his injury, dozens of people on Facebook had made their profile picture a growling panther (Jennings County High School’s mascot) with the words “Praying for Calvin.” T-shirts with “Praying for Calvin” on the front and Calvin’s last name and football number, 48, on the back, were sold for $10 as a fund-raiser to help pay for his medical expenses. Bake sales for Calvin. Soup dinners for Calvin. Silent auctions for Calvin. His classmates came up with the saying #CalvinStrong, which soon popped up around the county, on T-shirts, on signs posted along the streets and even on badges that were made and worn by first graders. The principal at Hayden Elementary, Brent Comer, said he didn’t even think the children knew what a hashtag meant, but they thought it was cool, so he decided to order rubber bracelets with the phrase #CalvinStrong, to sell for $2. All of it, again, to raise money for Calvin’s family. “We can moan and groan and be angry and be sad about what happened, but the family wants us to give them positive vibes, so that’s exactly what we’re trying to give them,” said Mr. Comer, who drove with Mrs. Stoner to try to see Calvin right after his injury. “We consider Calvin one of our family, and none of us are thinking about why it happened, or about football, right now. Not yet, at least.” So many other places in the United States recently have gone through situations like this. Small towns. Larger cities. Parts of the country that live for football and parts that don’t. About a month ago, in the span of one heartbreaking week, it was Troy, Ala., then Rolesville, N.C., then Wading River, N.Y. — all places where high school players died after sustaining  How many more communities will be forced to consider, in the harshest, most personal manner possible, how safe it is for their children to play football? It’s Jennings County’s turn to ponder it. Maybe not now, but soon. These days here, there hasn’t been much time for introspection. Calvin was injured on Nov. 1, when he and his county youth travel team played in an end-of-season all-star tournament in Columbus, about 30 miles from here. The event lasted two days, with doubleheaders each day. Several witnesses said that Calvin, a wispy running back, was “horse collared” in the first of two games that Saturday, which meant that an opposing player had pulled him down by grabbing the inside of his shoulder pads. One of his teammates and classmates, Raul Ruiz, told me Calvin was later blindsided by one tackle, got up from the ground, then dropped his head and grabbed his face mask, appearing distraught. “He was in the huddle crying, but when the coach said, ‘You, O.K.?’ He just said, ‘Yeah,’ and kept playing, tough little guy,” said Raul, who is 12 and considers himself Calvin’s best friend. After getting tackled during the second game that first day, Calvin walked to the sideline and told the coach and his father that he felt sick. Moments later, he collapsed, unresponsive, several witnesses said. An ambulance brought him to a hospital, and then he was airlifted to Riley Hospital for Children, in Indianapolis, where he had brain surgery and stayed. Raul’s mother, Laura White, was at the game and said all the parents congregated near the field, shocked at what had just unfolded. Even some top experts in the subject of sports concussions can’t agree whether children as young as 11, like Calvin, or 12, like Raul, should play tackle football. Some experts now say children younger than 14 shouldn’t play because their brains are still developing and their neck muscles aren’t yet strong enough to stabilize their heads during tackles. To me, that makes sense. Better safe than sorry, right? Others contend that a new focus on player safety has made youth football safer than ever, and that there is no reason to keep children from tackle football until there is scientific proof that it is more dangerous than, say, riding a bike. Raul, for one, said he was not thinking about quitting the game. At 5 feet 5 and 200 pounds, he thinks his size will protect him. “I’m not scared, but I’m scared for my smaller teammates,” he said. He acknowledged, though, that just before Calvin was injured, he almost pulled himself out of the game because his head was hurting from one tackle. His headache lasted for two days, he said. Scientists are still in the early stages of gathering data on young players. A trailblazing 2012 study showed that seven players age 7 and 8 sustained some hits as forceful as the more severe ones on the college level. Calvin’s immediate family declined a request to be interviewed, but other family members — and there are a lot of them here, as Calvin’s mother has nine brothers and sisters — said the episode would most likely give Calvin’s parents pause as to whether their three boys should continue to play football. One aunt, who didn’t want her name used out of respect for Calvin’s parents, said she had thought about pulling her young son from the sport, but had not. “He really loves it,” she said. “And besides, he’s really good at it and wants to play Division I football.” Calvin’s injury “can’t be pinned on X or Y,” his aunt said, and even his doctors can’t say definitively why his blood vessel burst that day, she said. Two weeks after Calvin got hurt, the fund-raisers are still going strong. At the high school girls’ basketball team’s season opener on Friday night, $254 was raised for the family in a 50-50 raffle. More than 1,500 “Praying for Calvin” T-shirts have been sold. Mr. Comer, Calvin’s principal, last week drove more than two and a half hours round-trip to Bloomington to pick up a signed football and a game-worn jersey with Calvin’s name sewn on the back, a gift to Calvin from Indiana University football Coach Kevin Wilson. Raul, Calvin’s buddy, said he often thought about whether Calvin will recognize him the next time they meet, which makes him teary-eyed. And Mrs. Stoner continued to give her class honest updates. On Friday, she shared the good news that Calvin was breathing on his own. “But you still can’t visit him, and he’s still not talking,” she told them. “It still will be a long road, and he might have to learn how to do things like eat and read again, so we all have to be here for him.” Of course, his classmates will be there. And this community will be there. In Jennings County, it’s ingrained in people to watch out for one another. The introspection about football’s safety issues will come, in time. For now, Calvin’s desk remains as he left it. His classmates have vowed not to touch the top of it until he returns. The reality is that the clock’s hands might tick for weeks, or months, before Calvin is back, perhaps so long from now that the Superman water cup atop his desk gathers dust. It’s a reminder that the legions of children who play football — though tucked inside their helmet and pads of superhero armor — are nowhere near invincible.
