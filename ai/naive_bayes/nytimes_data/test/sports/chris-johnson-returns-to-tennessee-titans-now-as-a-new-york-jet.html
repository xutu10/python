Chris Johnson Returns to Tennessee Titans, Now as a New York Jet
Now with the Jets, running back Chris Johnson said the decision to leave the Tennessee was not his, but he does not expect Titans fans to give him a break.

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. —   “I know a lot of fans don’t understand the business side of the game,” Johnson said Friday. “It was not my decision to leave.” Tennessee cut Johnson after he became the sixth back in N.F.L. history to gain 1,000 yards in each of his first six seasons, including an N.F.L-record 2,509 yards from scrimmage, 2,006 of them on the ground, in 2009. The move was driven, at least in part, by salary-cap considerations. Johnson was celebrated in Tennessee as CJ2K after he was the league’s offensive player of the year in 2009. Johnson’s production began to diminish after he sat out training camp in 2011. He returned after negotiating a four-year contract worth $53.5 million, with $30 million guaranteed. He dropped to a career low of 1,047 yards, from 1,364 in 2010. He rebounded to run for 1,243 yards in 2012 before declining to 1,077 yards last season, when he averaged a career-low 3.9 yards per carry. “He was trying to hit a home run every single carry, and that did not mesh with the offense,” said Frank Wycheck, a former Tennessee tight end who is now an analyst on the team’s radio broadcasts. Tennessee drafted Johnson in the first round in 2008, taking him 24th over all out of East Carolina, largely because of his game-breaking potential. He ran a 4.24-second 40-yard dash at the scouting combine, blinding speed that helped him score 50 touchdowns in his first six seasons. Wycheck believes that, to some degree, Johnson’s breakaway speed started to work against him. He thinks it led him to hit holes too quickly in his desire to uncork a spectacular run instead of keeping to the designed play. “You have to be patient, set up the blocks, let the guys up front take over, get to the next level and then hit the jets,” Wycheck said. Ken Whisenhunt, the Titans’ first-year coach, said several factors contributed to Johnson’s departure, but he declined to be specific. “I know how much he was liked here, how much he was respected, but it is certainly not uncommon in the N.F.L. now that players end up changing teams,” Whisenhunt said. “I don’t know Chris personally, but everything that I have heard about him has been positive, and I know that the Titans are grateful for his contributions.” Johnson, 29, signed a two-year contract worth $8 million to join the Jets, who, at 2-11, have the same dismal record as Tennessee. The Jets have kept to their plan of using him as a part-time back. With 125 carries for 558 yards and one touchdown and only three games left, Johnson’s streak of 1,000-yard seasons is surely over. He has taken a back seat to Chris Ivory, who leads the team in rushing attempts (162), rushing yards (714) and rushing touchdowns (five). The Jets hoped Johnson’s speed would provide a jolt to a passing game that sputtered, whether operated by Geno Smith, their unpolished second-year quarterback, or Michael Vick, their aging veteran. Johnson has only 22 receptions for 151 yards and one score. Nor has he been the playmaker the Jets hoped for in the red zone. They rank last in the league when it comes to converting opportunities inside their opponents’ 20-yard line, generating only 14 touchdowns in 37 tries (37.8 percent). “It’s not easy,” Johnson said of his reduced workload. “With losing on top of that, it’s tough.” Johnson ranks third in the history of the Houston/Tennessee franchise with 7,965 yards, trailing only Eddie George (10,009) and Earl Campbell (8,574). Among all N.F.L. backs, only Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings rushed for more yards (8,774) during the previous six years. Johnson defended his contribution in limited time with the Jets by noting that his average per carry improved to 4.5 yards. “The only thing I could do was to make sure I took advantage of my opportunities,” he said. Even Johnson’s harshest critics must commend his willingness to take the ball for Tennessee. He finished with 1,742 rushing attempts in six seasons. He made every start in 2013 despite tearing his meniscus in the third game. “I was the face of the organization,” Johnson said. “I wanted to be out there. I did all that, and really it didn’t mean anything.” Perhaps that commitment will be worthy of some applause in Tennessee.
