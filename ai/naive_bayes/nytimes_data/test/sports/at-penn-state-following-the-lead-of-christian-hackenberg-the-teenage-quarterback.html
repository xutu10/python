Penn State Follows the Lead of Christian Hackenberg, Its Teenage Quarterback
Hackenberg, a 19-year-old sophomore, behaves like the adult of the revitalized Nittany Lions, standing for something beyond the obvious tangible rewards of the game.

PISCATAWAY, N.J. — The quarterback walked into the interview room appearing to be significantly taller than his listed height of 6 feet 4 inches. The mind wasn’t playing tricks because Christian Hackenberg, a 19-year-old sophomore who behaves like the adult of the revitalized  A very good thing happened to a young man who didn’t slink off in the manner of Bill O’Brien, the former Penn State coach, who lured him to the program with convincing but ultimately empty ideals. It was Hackenberg, a teenager, who stayed and stood for something beyond the obvious tangible rewards. “When you come to a place like Penn State, it’s such a special place within college football, the history of college football,” he said after driving his team 80 yards late in the fourth quarter of  Play for a cause, or what big-time college football was once presumably intended to be about, too many millions of dollars ago. Make a statement on any given Saturday, as Hackenberg did when, seconds after a holding penalty nullified an apparent winning touchdown pass, he stepped back into the pocket and converted a third-and-12 sideline pass to Geno Lewis to the Rutgers 6, from which Bill Belton, in two running plays, reached the end zone. In its Big Ten debut, Rutgers was energized but inevitably still just Rutgers, throwing away good effort and karma — mostly in the form of five Gary Nova interceptions. Still, Hackenberg and company did have to make the most of their good fortune. Minutes after midnight, Hackenberg was chewing gum and wearing a blue Penn State cap over his dark hair. He talked about why he, as part of the uncompensated masses, did not pack up and move on when the highly paid O’Brien used the excuse of failing to exorcise the ghost of Joe Paterno to opt for even more money with the N.F.L.’s Houston Texans after last season. “I was back at home,” Hackenberg said. “I had my high school coach, both my parents, my group of people I like to talk to. At 18, you can’t go out and make an irrational decision based on emotions.” Who would have blamed him for shouting, “Get me out of here,” and moving to a place where he could at least shoot for a national title? Hackenberg’s back story is well chronicled: His father, Erick, grew up in Pennsylvania coal country, dreamed of playing quarterback for Paterno and wound up as a backup at Virginia. The pull of State College was strong, and O’Brien, while winning eight games with an undermanned team in 2012, played the recruitment hand to convince the much-sought-after Hackenberg that three years with no postseason opportunities would be a better deal for him than he would get anyplace else. Beyond O’Brien’s reputation as an offensive guru — he was a coordinator for Bill Belichick and Tom Brady in New England — there was resonance in the pitch, even if O’Brien would soon bail on it. Proof was the relief and, yes, the joy that the 2012 team produced for a university and a community scarred by the Jerry Sandusky horror and the subsequent dismissal and death of Paterno. There were no bowl dollars for two years, but as it turned out, there was plenty of currency in making the most of the privilege of still existing. “Every single week we went out there thinking we had to prove something,” Mike Hull, a senior middle linebacker, said. When O’Brien left, the Hackenbergs took the high road, saying that he had been honest with them during the negotiating process and that they understood college football was, after all, big business. Still, the family had to think about what to do next, depending on the identity of the new coach. That coach was James Franklin, formerly of Vanderbilt, by reputation a world-class recruiter and talker, who began his postgame news conference Saturday night by thanking reporters for covering the game and ended it by cautioning them to drive home safely. It didn’t take long for him to persuade Hackenberg that his passing fancies and N.F.L. prospects would be unaffected, which was logically the first priority. But Hackenberg, given a chance to reconsider his original choice, to sit out a season and to rematerialize in 2015 at another football factory, again did not fall for the bowl-game hype, the friends-of-the-program junket gifting. By circumstance owed to criminality and tragedy, Penn State’s players had discovered the meaning of true collectivism, and, Hackenberg said, “that is not going to change for a while,” even after  But perhaps it is inevitable that the low-hanging fruit of a down year can create too much priority and pressure of its own. When Penn State had nowhere to go, O’Brien, to his credit, helped make each game an event. He took chances others would not. He gambled on fourth downs. On Saturday night, with a 3-0 record at stake, you could already see Franklin playing it safe, surrendering potential shots at the end zone for safe calls, for field goals and punts. Hackenberg bailed him out at the finish. Even in a down-cycle conference, Penn State is no great team, and it has an inexperienced offensive line. It should still make some bowl game named for a car or a potato. Franklin is said to be on a recruiting roll that might even carry the Nittany Lions back into national title contention if he, unlike O’Brien, hangs around long enough. The lessons of the past three years at Penn State and the ethics of this sport at large should give us pause to think about how important that pursuit should really be. But for Hackenberg, at least, the restoration of bowl eligibility feels like a judgment fair-minded and fitting. Early this year, he saved Franklin a difficult first season by staying. On Saturday night, with his second late winning drive in three games, he spared his coach a defeat that would not have been taken kindly by the friends of the program in State College and potential recruits. “He’s light years ahead of a true sophomore,” Franklin said. The teenager stands tall as a program leader, arguably more than any coach, past or present.
