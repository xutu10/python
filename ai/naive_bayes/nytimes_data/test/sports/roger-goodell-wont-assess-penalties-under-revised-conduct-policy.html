Roger Goodell Won’t Assess Penalties Under Revised Conduct Policy
Under the league’s new N.F.L. personal conduct policy, announced Wednesday, Roger Goodell would cede the authority to assess penalties but retain the power to hear appeals.

IRVING, Tex. —  In a major step, Goodell would also cede authority to assess penalties but retain the power to hear any appeals by players. Goodell has been accused of having too much power and applied that power inconsistently. The revisions, which were approved unanimously by the 32 N.F.L. owners at a meeting here Wednesday, come in the wake of domestic abuse scandals involving Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and other players that have mushroomed into the biggest crisis of Goodell’s eight-year tenure. Several times in the past few months, Goodell has apologized for mishandling the cases and admitted that he did not understand the severity of domestic violence. His unusually frank mea culpa has done little to assuage his critics, from players to women’s support groups, who have called on him to resign. The strengthened personal conduct policy is also likely to trigger a showdown with the N.F.L. Players Association, which has argued that any changes to the policy should be collectively bargained. The union has suggested it may file a labor grievance and potentially go to court to argue its case, a step that could lead to an injunction. The N.F.L. said that it has sought input from the players during the past few months as it worked on the revisions. But it claims that the policy is ultimately under league control and does not have to be collectively bargained.
