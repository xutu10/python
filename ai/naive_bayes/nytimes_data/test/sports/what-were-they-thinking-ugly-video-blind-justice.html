Ray Rice Domestic Abuse Case Offers Questions for Prosecutors
What about this act of violence surprised professional football men? And what about it failed to move and anger New Jersey prosecutors?
===
Say this for Ray Rice: His left cross was of professional quality, a short, explosive punch. And his fiancée’s head snapped back as if she’d been shot. You watch that video and you get the national freakout. But what about this act of violence surprised professional football men? And what about it failed to move and anger New Jersey prosecutors? Robert K. Kraft, the New England Patriots’ owner, talked of his revulsion, citing the video as the reason Rice may never play again in the  Hello? This is the face of domestic abuse; it’s blood-bruise ugly. When the wife of an N.F.L. cornerback sports a black eye; when the girlfriend of a linebacker has road burn on her thighs because he dragged her outside his car; when a running back’s 4-year-old son is beaten with a small tree branch; when women have finger bruises on their necks, fractured ulnas and splintered clavicles, do league owners and general managers allow their minds to run down darkened alleys toward the truth? Or do they take refuge in anodyne phrases like “domestic abuse” and assume they see an aberration? As Ozzie Newsome, the Baltimore Ravens’ general manager, said of Rice in July, “That night was not typical of the Ray Rice we know and respect.” A man’s most brutal blows often are delivered in private and at night. Maybe that’s a relief for an employer. Maybe that is how Kraft, who talked of his family-values Patriots, justified trading in 2003 for Corey Dillon, a 6-foot-1, 225-pound running back. Three years earlier,  Dillon said he was trying to defend himself when he accidentally struck her. He received probation, made a donation to a battered women’s shelter and received counseling, according to The Chicago Tribune in 2001. Dillon set franchise running records and helped the Patriots win a Super Bowl. He retired to loud applause. To which we should append a footnote: In 2010, Dillon was arrested again, on suspicion of assaulting his wife. The Los Angeles district attorney later found “insufficient evidence” for a conviction, as Dillon’s wife recanted and said she was not assaulted. There was no videotape in that case. There is a spot of good news for the N.F.L. However halting and driven by economic calculus, Commissioner Roger Goodell has fashioned one of the toughest domestic abuse policies in professional sports. New Jersey prosecutors can make no such claims. In February, after Rice knocked Janay Palmer senseless in a casino elevator, Atlantic County prosecutors obtained two tapes. They watched as Rice delivered his knockout blow, and they watched as, with chilling nonchalance, he lugged his fiancée’s unconscious body five-sixths of the way out of the elevator. Then he picked up her shoes. Not long after, a grand jury handed up a felony indictment. Then the prosecutors did the legal equivalent of nothing. They allowed Rice to enroll in pretrial intervention, in which he agreed to counseling and admitted nothing. It was the puncher’s equivalent of a traffic ticket. Prosecutors insist they afforded him no special privilege. My colleague David Kocieniewski interviewed prosecutors, defense lawyers and domestic abuse experts the width and breath of New Jersey. Nearly everyone agreed this was true; this is how domestic abuse is treated. And New Jersey ranks toward the top on this problem. The prosecutors offered a scramble of justifications, flavored with dollops of truth. Domestic battery evidence is uncertain, and female victims are loath to testify against their men. (Janay Palmer took denial a step further; she married Rice the day after he was indicted on a charge of rendering her unconscious.) Prosecutors say they want to avoid records and jail terms for otherwise law-abiding young men. So legal precedent and wishful thinking serve to straitjacket prosecutors. I called a former New Jersey prosecutor, Ben Barlyn, who served as executive director of the  He also suffers from the habit of speaking honestly, and he could not quite conceal his disgust. Pretrial intervention gives much discretion to the prosecutor. It can help men and women who stumbled stupidly or emotionally, and should not face ruin. It was not intended for someone who knocked his wife into darkness. “If we had a videotape of someone cold-cocking his wife, that should be the end of it,” Barlyn said. “You don’t need the victim to testify.” There was no need to jail Rice. An admission of guilt alone sets a useful precedent. “It’s obnoxious,” Barlyn said of the decision to allow Rice to walk away. “It was clear and serious domestic violence.” Counseling is a notoriously unreliable cure. In New York, the Center for Court Innovation in 2005  Judy Harris Kluger was chief of policy for the New York State Courts and now heads  “Wife beating is not drug addiction; it’s not alcoholism, it’s not something that can be ‘cured,’ ” she noted. “It’s criminal conduct. They are not beating up their boss and their friends; they are beating up their girlfriends and wives.” Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, helped write and lobby for a bill, signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, that toughened penalties for second-time abusers. The goal is not to send more men trotting off to prison. It’s to send a clear message to a bully. “Conviction seems to be one of the big deterrents,” Vance said. “Most studies seem to suggest the more intrusive the sentence, the lower the rate of recidivism.” So we walk back along a curling trail to the N.F.L. and the Rice case. Goodell’s thrust, to suspend abusers for six games at a cost for the player that could run into the millions of dollars, was an exercise in firm consequences. (Goodell’s more recent decision to suspend Rice indefinitely carries the heavy odor of panic.) And now he faces a yet more momentous decision: What to do about the Minnesota Vikings’ Adrian Peterson? Perhaps the best running back of this age, Peterson was indicted on charges of abusing his 4-year-old son with a small tree branch. With his punch, Ray Rice has left a door ajar for a league and a nation. The ugliness inside horrified. So far, the N.F.L. has taken bigger steps than many state prosecutors. That’s a little scary all on its own.
