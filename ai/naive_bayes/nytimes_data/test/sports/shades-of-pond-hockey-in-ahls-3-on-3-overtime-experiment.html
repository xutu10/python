Shades of Pond Hockey in A.H.L.'s 3-on-3 Overtime Experiment
The American Hockey League is testing a new seven-minute overtime, and this rule change in the N.H.L.'s top farm league could be a blueprint for making the shootout a rare event.

Few things in sports are as roundly reviled as the hockey shootout, but this season the American Hockey League is conducting an experiment that has become so successful it may render the shootout an endangered species. At present, when an N.H.L. game is tied after a five-minute overtime, three skaters from each team take alternating penalty shots — a gimmicky skills competition, purists say — to determine a winner. But A.H.L. games now feature a seven-minute overtime, in which fans may see a three-on-three game. The result is a wild end game of breakaways, odd-man rushes and defense-be-damned pond hockey. It has thrilled fans and players and has resulted in winning goals so often that it has helped slash the number of shootouts by two-thirds. “The shootout was exciting for a while, but I think maybe it ran its course,” said Luke Richardson, the coach of the Binghamton Senators. “This is a team sport, and if you can end the game as a team sport instead of an individual skills competition, it’s better. And three-on-three is exciting at the same time.” Most N.H.L. general managers and coaches and many players have viewed the shootout with distaste since the league adopted it in 2005-6 to abolish ties (it is not used in the playoffs). But the rule change in the A.H.L., the N.H.L.’s top farm league, seems to be a blueprint for making the shootout a rare event. The first three minutes of overtime in the A.H.L. are played conventionally, with four skaters versus four skaters. If the game is still tied at the first whistle after the three-minute mark, the teams switch to a three-on-three game for the remainder of the extra period. If the score is still tied after seven minutes of overtime, only then will the game go to a shootout. The results have been emphatic. Last season, when the A.H.L. used the conventional five-minute, four-on-four overtime, 64.7 percent of games (178 of 275) went to a shootout. Entering Wednesday’s games, only 22.2 percent of overtime games reached a shootout (12 of 54). Of the 42 overtime goals scored, 22 were tallied while teams were skating four a side; 20 came with three skaters a side. Fans who have seen three-on-three action live or in video clips are treated to breakneck, end-to-end play or stick-to-stick passing in the offensive zone as defenders scramble futilely to keep up. If an attacker gets free with the puck, invariably there will be no one between him and the goaltender. If the goalie stops the shot, it often will start an odd-man rush charging back the other way. “I think it’s awesome,” Bridgeport defenseman Aaron Ness said. “It’s definitely a different look for the fans, and a different look for us, too. We’ve got more room, more time, more chances to use our ability.” Coaches and players have little experience with three-on-three outside of summer leagues and childhood games on frozen rivers and ponds. “We’re still trying to figure it out, who’s covering who and who we want out there at certain times,” Ness said. “Right now it’s more of a guessing game for guys.” Coaches say they have not figured out a strategy for it beyond putting their fastest, most skilled players on the ice and asking them to take just the right amount of risks. “You don’t want to absolutely sell the farm to create something, but if the opportunity arises to create something, you want to be efficient and make the most of it,” said Ken Gernander, the coach of the Hartford Wolf Pack. “In order to get, you have to give up a little bit.” Inevitably, players are making back passes to goalies — tactics almost unheard-of in hockey — when a team is pressured in the neutral zone. According to statistics, during three-on-three play almost twice as many shots are taken as during four-on-four play, and a higher percentage find the net. All this is music to the ears of N.H.L. general managers, especially Ken Holland of the Detroit Red Wings, who has spearheaded the three-on-three movement. At last week’s meeting in Toronto, he and other managers said it was too early to assess the A.H.L.’s experiment, but they will revisit it in March when they meet again and could propose it to the rules committee in June for adoption for the 2015-16 season. The N.H.L. installed the shootout to win back fans who had become alienated by years of turgid play and the season-long lockout of 2004-5. Since the start of the 2011-12 season, about 58 percent of N.H.L. games that go to overtime are decided by shootout. While many fans still like the shootout, most people in hockey chafe at the idea of games and playoff positions being decided by a static, one-on-one penalty-shot contest that only tangentially has anything to do with hockey. But not everyone in the A.H.L. approves of three-on-three play in overtime. Bridgeport Coach Brent Thompson says it is “not real hockey.” Texas Stars center Travis Morin calls it “goofy” and says he is “not a fan of it.” But more often the verdict is favorable. Gernander said he “definitely” preferred three-on-three play over shootouts because it was “more along the line of traditional hockey or a situation you would see” in a game. “I don’t know why the shootout is still around,” Richardson said. “Maybe it was a good in-betweener to get us to this point. With three-on-three you know you have to go for it. It’s a good way to end the game.”
