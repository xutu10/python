So Close to Goal Line and Yet So Far From It, Jets Feel Red-Zone Blues
The Jets are among the N.F.L.’s worst teams at scoring touchdowns once they have advanced to the red zone, the area from the opponent’s 20-yard line to its goal line.

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. —  Twelve times this season,  Inside the condensed area that begins at the opposition’s 20-yard line, a space that shrinks passing windows and compresses running lanes and accentuates the importance of trust between quarterbacks and receivers, the Jets have scored four touchdowns. They have also fumbled three times, taken three sacks and committed two turnovers. Their 33.3 percent conversion rate (4 of 12) inside the  Coaches emphasize no sacks, no interceptions, no penalties. Yet “we’ve done all those things,” Coach  The Jets’ troubles vex Ryan, his coaching staff and the players. In 36 snaps (33 offensive plays), the Jets have gained 27 yards. Their running game (14 rushes, 15 yards) has been silenced by an abandonment, which the coordinator Marty Mornhinweg took responsibility for, and by opponents’ blitzes. Their passing game has been stymied by poor reads, imprecise throws and, to a lesser degree, the absence for much of last game of Eric Decker, who made seven of his 11 touchdown catches last season on plays that originated in the red zone. The onus, in many respects, is on  The day after the Jets’ loss in Green Bay, the receivers coach Sanjay Lal showed his unit film of Philip Rivers’s three touchdown tosses to Antonio Gates in San Diego’s victory over Seattle — as if to say, “This is what we should aspire to.” Gates and Rivers have cultivated that connection over a decade. Smith and his receivers are still developing chemistry, and in the red zone, where there is little time — or room — for plays to develop, the slightest miscommunication or misunderstanding can portend doom. “Not to say you don’t try to be perfect all the time,” Lal said, “but in the red zone, you have to be as close as possible to have success.” In the red zone, receiver David Nelson said, everything happens faster. Decisions. Throws. Routes. The shrunken field limits what offenses can do — no deep threats, for instance — but Lal said it also narrowed the Jets’ focus. It allows teams to divine opponents’ defensive tendencies and then design plays — and practice them, over and over — to beat those coverages. Ryan said he was pleased with Mornhinweg’s play calling, if not the team’s execution. Mornhinweg was candid, by his standards, in assessing the Jets’ red-zone deficiencies. He acknowledged that the Jets should have rushed the ball more against Chicago, especially on their last drive, when, despite having two timeouts, they called six straight pass plays. One of their strengths is Chris Ivory, a bruising running back, and he did not have a touch in the fourth quarter. More cryptic — and fascinating — was Mornhinweg’s criticism of Smith. He said that Smith’s turnovers “were an issue now” and that although he played “beautifully” for 90 percent of the Chicago game, perhaps Mornhinweg had too much confidence in him in the red zone. A week earlier, Mornhinweg said he should have trusted Smith to fix an alignment problem instead of gesturing for a timeout that eventually negated a tying score in Green Bay. “I just relied a little too much on him,” Mornhinweg said, referring to the Bears game, “and there will be a time, hopefully very quickly, where we can do that.” He added, “I put just a little too much on his plate there, and I could have helped him a couple different ways.” Across three games, Smith has turned in some of his best moments in the red zone — his bootleg touchdown in Green Bay, his 13-yard toss to Jeremy Kerley on third-and-11 against the Packers, his 19-yard scoring pass to Kerley against Chicago — but also some of his worst. The sacks he took were inexcusable, coaches said, and each knocked the Jets back at least 12 yards. One sack, a 19-yarder against Oakland, pushed them out of field-goal range. Smith’s interception on Monday night, when he underthrew a ball to David Nelson, came after the pocket had collapsed. Smith violated a central tenet that his coaches preached. Touchdowns or checkdowns, they tell him. If Smith’s first or second option is not immediately open, he is taught to run with the ball or dump it to a running back underneath — not, say, to scramble left and throw across his body. “It starts with the quarterback position,” Ryan said. “We’ve got to be 100 percent dead-on in that situation.” Mornhinweg mentioned that perhaps he would simplify, and shrink, some of the Jets’ play calls in the red zone. But Ryan said that should not be interpreted to mean that Smith would wear, as his predecessor, Mark Sanchez, once did, a color-coded wristband — plays were coded as red (conservative), yellow (caution) and green (aggressive) — intended to ease the decision-making process. The Jets emphasized red-zone work last week, especially the importance of being more productive on first down. Of six plays run on first-and-10 against Chicago, the Jets gained 2 yards or less every time. Included in that ineptitude was Smith’s interception. After reviewing film of that loss, Decker came away with one overarching thought. “We really need to score touchdowns,” he said.
