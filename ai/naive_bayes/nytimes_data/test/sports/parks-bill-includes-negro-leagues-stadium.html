One of the final remaining stadiums where Negro leagues baseball was played may soon become part of a national park. The Senate overwhelmingly approved a measure Friday that would add Hinchliffe Stadium to Great Falls National Historical Park in Paterson, N.J. The measure, one of several parks bills that were attached to a defense policy bill, now heads to President Obama’s desk. The stadium opened in 1932 and was home to several Negro leagues teams, including the New York Black Yankees and the New York Cubans.
