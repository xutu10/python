You’ve noticed his photo credit line for years — BARTON SILVERMAN/THE NEW YORK TIMES — but he is retiring at 72 after a five-decade career of capturing what he called “the peak of action” at sports events. “You have to be quick or you’re dead,” he often said. “You can’t ask ’em to do it again.” You can’t ask Giants receiver David Tyree to pin another football to his helmet in the Super Bowl. You can’t ask Reggie Jackson to smash another home run in the World Series. You can’t ask Joe Frazier to throw another left hook that will flatten Muhammad Ali. “You can’t tell horses to run the race again,” he said. “You either get it or you don’t.” As an esteemed newspaper sports photographer, he almost always got it. The next day, his photo was splashed across the front page of The Times’s sports section, if not on the front page of the paper. With grace, he moved from film to digital photography, enabling people to see his work more immediately on screens around the world. The photo desk depended on him to get  “I’m a photo-reporter,” he liked to say. “The next day, that event, that moment, has to be in the newspaper.” Growing up in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, he was 6 when his father, a Fulton Fish Market merchant, died. Years later, he was cleaning a closet when he discovered cameras and lights his father had used. “I’m 12 years old; I’m in the seventh grade,” he recalled. “To me, it was like finding jewels.” He joined the camera club at Seth Low Junior High School. At Lafayette High School, he was the club president. At Brooklyn College, he was photo editor of the student newspaper and the yearbook. He answered a Times classified ad for a photo lab technician and got the job. He hustled assignments that staff photographers didn’t want. In 1965, after winning a worldwide award for his photos of the construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, he was promoted to the staff. And if you’ve enjoyed his photos all these years, you know the rest.
