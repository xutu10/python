A Final Handshake, Perhaps, and More Head-Shaking for Rex Ryan
Ryan, in perhaps his final home game as the Jets coach, was narrowly denied a victory over Patriots Coach Bill Belichick, whom Ryan has measured himself against during his tenure in New York.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — When it was over,  Maybe someday they will have a beer or two together. Ryan, in a lighter moment last week, said he would like that. But he was not in much of a mood to discuss his social plans late Sunday afternoon, after Belichick’s  The two coaches shared a quick handshake and awkward embrace, and off they went. As they drew close, Ryan may have said something to Belichick. Or Belichick may have said something to Ryan. “I don’t remember,” Ryan said. Give him the benefit of the doubt, but the man has encyclopedic recall. He has never forgotten, and very likely never will, how the Patriots won by 2 points in October, by 3 last September, by 30 on Thanksgiving night 2013, by 3 in overtime two Octobers ago, and so on. As the Patriots dashed to their 10th victory in 11 games and a first-round bye, the 3-12 Jets are wheezing toward the end of the season and, probably, Ryan’s final week as coach. His reign could be distilled into one sentence: He never did dethrone New England. Including a postseason victory in 2011, Ryan went 4-9 against the Patriots. Their six consecutive A.F.C. East titles — the second-longest streak in N.F.L. history — coincide with Ryan’s six seasons as coach. “I think you look at them, that guy does a hell of a job,” Ryan said of Belichick. “There’s no denying that. They make big plays at big times.” So they did again Sunday. Jamie Collins’s third-quarter interception led to Jonas Gray’s go-ahead touchdown. Dont’a Hightower’s 10-yard sack of Geno Smith, on third-and-4 from the New England 24, increased the degree of difficulty for Nick Folk, whose go-ahead 52-yard field-goal attempt was tipped by Vince Wilfork and fell short. Brandon Bolden’s 8-yard rush gave the Patriots the first down they needed to run out the clock and send the Jets spiraling to more misery. Ryan concocted a defensive game plan that limited the Patriots to 231 yards, the fewest in his 13 games against them as the Jets’ coach, and drew praise from both locker rooms. “You’re thinking about things all day,” Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said. Belichick added, “We’ve played a lot of games like this against the Jets.” Ryan’s obsession with all things Belichick and New England is consuming — “I’ve never stopped not thinking about the Patriots,” Ryan once said — and steeped in respect, for sure, but also in envy. New England has Brady, the quarterback Ryan wished he had; and Darrelle Revis, the cornerback Ryan once had, wanted back and needed this season; and the A.F.C. East championships Ryan thought he would win, that he would wrest away, when he was hired in January 2009. For all their superficial differences, Ryan and Belichick are quite similar. Both are regarded as defensive masterminds. Both are accepting of players with perceived character issues, confident that they can reform them — Santonio Holmes and Antonio Cromartie among the Jets, Randy Moss and Albert Haynesworth among the Patriots — with what they believe is the proper structure and methods. And both engender tremendous loyalty among their players. “Rex has been so sturdy and so strong, so resilient, and led the charge week after week,” said offensive lineman Willie Colon, who added, “I honestly wanted to win for him more than anybody.” Ryan looked toward New England, toward the Belichick bunker, and felt — and still does, presumably — that his style would be just as effective. That is why he barged into New York saying he would never kiss Belichick’s rings, turning an already fierce rivalry into something a little more personal. When the Jets lost, 45-3, at New England in December 2010, Ryan acknowledged that he went up there to “kick his butt, and he kicked mine.” For so long these games, rooted in what the former defensive tackle Kris Jenkins once called “professional hatred,” have served as the Jets’ barometer, and the contrast in personalities had made their twice-yearly matchups among the more entertaining in the N.F.L. “We know how much this game meant to us,” Jets safety Calvin Pryor said when asked about Ryan’s message to the team. “We knew this was going to be our Super Bowl for this season.” There was no official acknowledgment of Ryan’s precarious job security, of course. No tribute video or highlight montage, and Ryan said he did not take any mental snapshots as he retreated into the tunnel and strode into a future uncertain beyond next week’s finale at Miami. When he took his place behind the lectern for what could have been his final time at MetLife Stadium, Ryan lamented how close the Jets were, how close they have been, losing three of their last four games with New England by a total of 6 points, and yet they are still so far. Ryan came to New York to unseat Belichick. He tried. But, it seems, he never will.
