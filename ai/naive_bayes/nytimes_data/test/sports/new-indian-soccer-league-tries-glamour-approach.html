New Indian Soccer League Tries Glamour Approach
The creation of a professional league, backed with huge investments and Bollywood glamour, has prompted a level of excitement more common to cricket.

NEW DELHI — Indian soccer fans still sometimes dream of an alternate reality, one where their sport, and not cricket, is the national obsession. Domestic soccer is a niche game here, largely starved of funds and facilities and forgotten by most Indians. But the creation of a new professional league — backed with huge investments, Bollywood glamour and a phalanx of faded international stars — has at least temporarily revived interest in the sport, which has long been overshadowed by cricket and cricket’s $3 billion Indian Premier League. The Indian Super League, which opened last month, has brought unprecedented money and attention to Indian soccer. It has signed aging big-name European players for what is the latest and most concerted effort in a perhaps quixotic quest to establish the game in the mainstream here. Alessandro Del Piero, Robert Pirés, Freddie Ljungberg, Nicolas Anelka and David Trezeguet are among a dozen veteran foreign players signed up for the 10-week tournament. Although the risk of relying on aging talent quickly became apparent — Ljungberg, out with a hamstring injury, has played only once — it has had its benefits. Fifty-six million Indians watched the first week of the Super League, comparing favorably with the audience of 140 million for the I.P.L.'s opening two weeks. The Week 1 Super League audience was 15 times as big as the one for the opening games of India’s current domestic league, the I-League. Audiences later fell to about 11 million in Week 5, a warning that celebrity appeal may not be enough for the soccer revolution the organizers hope for. But the numbers are still unprecedented for Indian soccer, easily surpassing those for this year’s World Cup. The league’s broadcaster says the real number of viewers could be triple that reported. “Soccer is already bigger in India than everybody thinks,” said Arunava Chaudhuri, chief executive of Mumbai City F.C., one of the new clubs. “But it needs to start somewhere. It’s not going to be a one-shot thing.” The league is the biggest private Indian sports venture since the I.P.L was introduced in 2008. Owners of its eight new teams pay about $25 million each for 10-year franchises. The English Premier League is a partner, and most of world soccer’s major sponsors are involved. Like the I.P.L., the Super League was designed for television, and its competition is a seasonal tournament, with a winner but no relegation. The I-League, in comparison, embraces the relegation and promotion model of European soccer. The new league is being portrayed as a first step toward India’s becoming a soccer nation and coincides with growing investment at the amateur level. In 2017, India will hold FIFA’s Under-17 World Cup, the first time it has been host to a global soccer tournament. “If you want to build something, you need money,” said Robert Pirès, 41, the former Arsenal striker and World Cup winner with France who is now playing for Goa F.C. “And there is a lot of money in India.” He said he had been paid $750,000 for the three-month competition. Six weeks in, the league is seen as a solid if not overwhelming success, with room to grow. “These numbers are enough to bring the sponsors back,” said Joseph Eapen, an analyst at Repucom, which monitors advertising reach in Indian sports. “It is already working.” It may seem odd now, but once India did not think of itself as a cricket nation. From the early 20th Century until the 1960s, soccer was the country’s main sport, and the Indian national team once was the champion of Asia. Kolkata is still home to the world’s largest soccer derby. But a decline in investment and facilities saw the sport slip into insignificance. India’s national team is currently  Although the 10-team I-League has grown steadily since 2007, its stadiums are small and the level of play is below that in the United States. But with a growing middle class that is increasingly willing to spend on entertainment and with millions already watching European soccer, the Super League’s backers believe India can support two national sports. World soccer’s authorities have long viewed India, with its population of 1.2 billion, as a sleeping giant waiting to become the sport’s biggest market. The league is part of rising investment in Indian sport: STAR India, the broadcaster behind the soccer league, invested $3.2 billion in sports last year and has introduced major leagues in badminton and field hockey, popular sports here. India’s huge population alters the calculus for broadcasters. “Even a niche does very well for numbers,” said Siddhanth Aney, editor of Sports Illustrated India. “You only need 1 percent of the TV audience to be successful.” The Super League is supposed to direct some of that enthusiasm to the I-League. The All India Football Federation, the country’s ruling body for soccer, said this week that it plans for the two leagues to merge within the next five years, and the I-League could use the help. While cricket players like Sachin Tendulkar are revered, I-League players are largely unknown, and their wages average only about 5 percent of those in the I.P.L. Although the I-League has brought professionalism to the game — players no longer work in hotels to support themselves — it has struggled to attract sponsors. In 2013, the league’s own official broadcaster decided it wasn’t interested in televising the opening games. A respected business paper, The Economic Times, said the league “might as well be happening on Mars.” Publicity isn’t a problem for the new league, which has borrowed unabashedly from outside success. Bollywood actors and cricket stars, like Tendulkar, have bought stakes in teams. Kolkata’s team goes by “Atlético de Kolkata,” a nod to the Spanish club Atlético Madrid, which is a co-owner of the Indian club. With television ratings already slipping, some have questioned the staying power of such manufactured appeal, but many fans are just pleased to see money flowing toward India and well-known players taking part in the game there. “There is a lot of corporate marketing behind this Super League, but I think it is genuinely exciting,” said Kanishk Tharoor, an Indian journalist who covers soccer. “To see Robert Pirès, very slow and doddering, playing in Goa is a kind of surreal, wonderful thing.” Enthusiasts also point to India’s history as one reason the new soccer league could succeed. Soccer played an important role in India’s independence movement, generating a sense of national pride. A 1911 match in which an Indian soccer team beat an English club to win an all-India tournament is still celebrated as a moment of national awakening. “That kind of destroyed the impression of invincibility of the British,” said Kausik Bandyopadhyay, author of several histories of Indian soccer. “Football became a way for Indians to show their worth, as manly, as against European imagery of Bengalis as womanly.” Quality may be the biggest threat to the new league: The level of play is still well below that of top-tier leagues in Europe and organizers say they know it must improve if they are to keep people watching. It has already had to scramble to keep up with its ambitions: With India short on soccer stadiums, several of the league’s fields are cricket pitches with soccer fields hurriedly laid over the top.
