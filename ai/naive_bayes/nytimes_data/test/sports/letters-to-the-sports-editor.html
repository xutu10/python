To the Sports Editor: Re “Playoff Selection Quandary: Should Injuries Matter?” Dec. 1: What a disappointment that the executive director of the new College Football Playoff, Bill Hancock, was quoted as saying that injuries were fair game for the committee to consider. An obvious argument is that highly ranked teams have earned their stripes over a long and grueling season. And good coaches can use such injuries to effectively rally the troops and get an unexpected win. A more compelling argument is the present state of football in the N.C.A.A. and the N.F.L. The news is rife with reports of on-field and off-field violence: concussions, domestic violence and sexual assault. Do we really want to provide motivation, however subtle, for more injuries? If the college playoff committee members ultimately give weight to injuries, that is the message they are sending. CHRISTINE M. HRENYA Boulder, Colo. More on ‘No More’ To the Sports Editor: Re “To Rescue Image, Ray Rice Turns to Best Ally, the Woman He Hit,” Dec. 2: Watching Janay Rice and reading about her characterization of Ray Rice’s behavior as a mistake produces a nightmare to match witnessing the abuse on video. “Mistake” becomes a meaningless euphemism when applied to what could be considered criminal behavior. Ray Rice’s real mistake was being videotaped, and his act became little more than the latest reality television. The “mistake” remains for all to see and for some potential Ray Rices to mimic. PATRICIA AIKEN O’NEILL Naples, Fla.  To the Sports Editor: Re “N.F.L.’s Rice Wins Reinstatement in Arbitration,” Nov. 29: Any N.F.L. team that signs the former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice will make a mockery of the league’s “No More” public-service announcements: “No more violence, no more silence, no more excuses.” MIKE RICE South Wellfleet, Mass. Nothing Worth Toasting To the Sports Editor: Re “Cue the ‘Chariots of Fire’ Theme, With Burps,” Dec. 3: It is the height of hypocrisy to highlight events like the beer mile and express alarm when a fraternity drunkfest gets out of hand. Deep down — or at least a few shots down — some of these runners are the same characters. GLENN ROBBINS Glen Ridge, N.J. Concussions: Plain Talk To the Sports Editor: Re “Concussions, by the New Book,” Nov. 30: Neurologists, neurosurgeons, athletic trainers, CT scans and M.R.I.s only identify concussions. When will some of the experts just say, “There is no treatment for a concussion”? Tear a ligament; we’ll reconstruct it. Break a bone; we’ll cast it or put rods, screws or plates on it, and it will heal. But a concussion is forever. Can anyone just say that? LOUIS LURIE, M.D. Bonita, Calif.
