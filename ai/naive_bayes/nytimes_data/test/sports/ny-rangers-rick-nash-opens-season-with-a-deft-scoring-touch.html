Rangers’ Rick Nash Opens Season With a Deft Scoring Touch
The bounces didn’t go Nash’s way in last season’s playoffs, but he is off to a blistering start this year.

GREENBURGH, N.Y. —  Rick Nash insists there is no secret formula that is sending his shots into the net instead of high or wide. High and wide shots were a common sight during the  Nash points to grinding effort and lucky bounces as to why his results have been favorable the first two weeks this season. “It’s definitely puck luck,” said Nash, who was tied with the Anaheim Ducks’ Corey Perry for the N.H.L. lead in goals entering Friday’s games. “I usually find myself a streaky player. If they are going in, they are going in.  When they’re not, that rebound doesn’t come right to you.” With a franchise history that dates to 1926, Nash is the first Ranger to score goals in six of the team’s first seven regular-season games. The only Rangers with as many goals through seven games to open a season were Bill Cook in 1931-32 and Don Murdoch in 1976-77, when he had eight goals in six contests. Nash’s tying goal late in the third period of On Sunday against the San Jose Sharks, Nash dumped the puck toward goalie Alex Stalock from beyond the blue line, then chased his own rebound through three Sharks  Nash’s efforts were evident during last spring’s playoffs, but bounces did not go his way. He scored only three times in 25 playoff games, all against the Canadiens in the six games of the conference finals. His frustration was never higher than after an overtime chance in Game 5 of the finals against the Los Angeles Kings.  Nash had the chance to send the series back to New York for Game 6 with a clear shot at an empty net, but Kings defenseman Slava Voynov managed to tip the puck out of harm’s way. Los Angeles eventually scored to finish the series and hoist the Cup for the second time in three years. That angst-causing memory will forever remain with last season’s Rangers, but Nash said he had turned the page. “We got to the finals and it was a lot of fun,” he said. “But it’s over and done with. This is a new season.” Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault has always kept his faith in Nash, who scored only 26 goals in 65 games last season. He missed 17 contests early in the season with a concussion. Vigneault constantly praised Nash’s two-way game in the playoffs, an ability noticed by teammates as well. “He works extremely hard, backchecking and creating chances,” Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist said. “He has a very intelligent approach to the game. He really reads plays well. With Rick, it’s one quick move and in the net.” With the top-line center Derek Stepan out with a broken leg, the 6-foot-4 Nash has recently been skating on a line with the 6-foot-5 Hayes and the 6-foot-3 Chris Kreider, a combination of size sure to create challenges for the opposition. Nash’s success scoring does not surprise Vigneault. “Definitely, it’s a product of hard work,” Vigneault said. “But goal scorers are that way. Rick has played some really good hockey for us. He was getting unreal chances and for whatever reason they weren’t going in. Now everything he seems to be throwing at the net, he’s in the right place at the right time.” Nash joined the Rangers in a blockbuster trade with the Columbus Blue Jackets in July 2012 after the Rangers lost to the Devils in the Eastern Conference finals. The first overall pick of the 2002 draft by the Blue Jackets, Nash was viewed as the scoring machine the team needed to reach the next level. But the mild-mannered Nash seemed to take time to adjust to the faster pace of life in Manhattan. He had 21 goals in 44 games of the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season, but just one in 12 playoff games. Last year was similarly frustrating in the postseason. But Nash’s calm outward demeanor has not changed, whether he is struggling to score or he is rippling the twine in bunches. “I’m always trying to get my game honest and safe defensively,” said Nash, who has 344 career goals. “I try to get my chances from good defense.” SLAP SHOTS Alain Vigneault said the 19-year-old rookie forward Anthony Duclair, who is from Montreal, would dress against the Canadiens. Duclair was a healthy scratch the past two games after recording three assists in the first five.
