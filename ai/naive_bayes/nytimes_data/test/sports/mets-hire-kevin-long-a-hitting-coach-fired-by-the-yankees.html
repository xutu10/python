Mets Hire Kevin Long, a Hitting Coach Fired by the Yankees
It came as little surprise that the Mets hired Long, the hitting coach the Yankees dismissed this month, given the struggles of Curtis Granderson, the former Yankee who became the Mets’ most expensive free-agent signing in years.

Curtis Granderson played some of his best baseball in the four years Kevin Long served as his hitting coach. Granderson became a dynamic power threat, albeit in a hitters’ park, and at times had success against left-handed pitching. So it came as no surprise when the  Although the Mets may never admit it publicly, Granderson’s signing is weighing on them. Last off-season, they made him their most expensive free-agent addition in years, hoping he would bring leadership and power. But his debut season was troublesome. Granderson, who will turn 34 in March, batted just .227 and drove in 66 runs. He is still owed about $45 million over the next three years, a huge sum for the frugal Mets. Already this off-season, the Mets have decided to move in the right-field fences at Citi Field, most likely with Granderson in mind. Of the 20 home runs Granderson hit in the regular season, only seven came at home. Under Long’s tutelage, Granderson had his best season in 2011. The Yankees led the majors in runs scored three times and finished second twice while Long was their hitting coach. But they struggled this season, finishing 13th in the American League in runs, and dismissed him this month. Long, 47, is the Mets’ third hitting coach in five months. The Mets started the season with Dave Hudgens in the role, fired him on Memorial Day and replaced him with Lamar Johnson. But the team’s problems at the plate continued, resulting in a search that led the Mets to a coach associated with their crosstown rivals.
