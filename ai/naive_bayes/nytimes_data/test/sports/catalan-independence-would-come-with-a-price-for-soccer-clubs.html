The president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, said Catalan clubs such as Barcelona would be excluded from league soccer should the region succeed in its push for independence from Spain. The government of Catalonia is pushing for a referendum to see how many of the region’s inhabitants would like to secede. The plan is overwhelmingly opposed by Spain’s parliament. ■ Landon Donovan will captain the United States on Friday in his national team finale against Ecuador in East Hartford, Conn. ■ UEFA barred the Italian football federation president, Carlo Tavecchio, for six months after he made a racist comment during his election campaign. Tavecchio made a reference to bananas when discussing the presence of foreign players in Italy. ■ The manager of the English club Watford, Billy McKinlay, was replaced after just eight days in charge. Watford owner Gino Pozzo decided that the club needs a more experienced coach and hired a former Chelsea midfielder, Slavisa Jokanovic. McKinlay was unbeaten in his two games in charge.
