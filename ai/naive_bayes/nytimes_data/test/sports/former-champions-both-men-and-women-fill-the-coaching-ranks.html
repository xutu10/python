Former Champions, Both Men and Women, Fill the Coaching Ranks
WTA Tour players looking to break through are following the lead of Andy Murray and enlisting former top players as their guides.

Andy Murray Murray enlisted the former champion Ivan Lendl to coach him at the start of the 2012 season, trusting Lendl to give him the boost he needed to win his first Grand Slam singles title. Murray won the  Other leading men’s players followed suit, hiring Lendl’s contemporaries. In this year’s Wimbledon final, Novak Djokovic, coached by Boris Becker, defeated Roger Federer, coached by Stefan Edberg. In the United States Open final, Marin Cilic, guided by Goran Ivanisevic, steamrollered Kei Nishikori, whose coach is Michael Chang. After Murray and Lendl  “It’s hard to ignore when everyone else, especially on the ATP Tour, was doing it,” said Stuart Duguid, Radwanska’s agent. “I think at this point, she maybe felt like she had plateaued a little bit, and was looking for some fresh inspiration, motivation. So this idea was kind of conceived among us in her team, and she thought it was a good idea. And then Martina was the only person that it would have worked with; she wouldn’t have done it with anyone else, because she was her idol in tennis. “Aga has won at every other level, she’s been to the final of a Grand Slam, she’s won Masters; the only thing she hasn’t done is won a Grand Slam. Who better to help her take the next step than Martina?” Navratilova, who will be the clubhouse leader among coaches with her 18 Grand Slam singles titles, said in a statement announcing the partnership: “I did not sleep very well last night, thinking about getting back into match mode and the competitions. I can’t wait to get started on this new phase of my career.” Radwanska, who will also continue to work with Tomasz Wiktorowski, her current coach, will join Navratilova after Christmas in Miami, Navratilova’s base. Navratilova is under contract through Wimbledon, and is slated to work with Radwanska at seven tournaments in the first half of next year. Davenport, a mother of four, was less eager for a coaching opportunity than Navratilova, her colleague in the commentary booth for Tennis Channel. (A third Tennis Channel commentator, Justin Gimelstob, will also moonlight as the coach of John Isner, the highest-ranked American on the men’s side.) Davenport was initially approached for more of a mentorship role with Keys, but they hit it off in their first meeting, and Keys relocated to California from Florida. Keys has trained in the off-season with Davenport, whose husband, Jon Leach, has also pitched in on the court when not at his finance job. Keys even joined her new coaches and their children, the oldest of whom is 7, on their family trip to Hawaii. After a planned partnership between Keys and Wim Fisette, Simona Halep’s former coach, did not pan out, Davenport agreed to a larger role as a traveling coach. “She’s been phenomenal to work with,” Davenport said of Keys, 19. “We feel like, in some cases, we have a fifth child now, and we love it. We’re going to help her until things kind of fall into place for her, and maybe then I’ll be a mentor and not be there every day. But for right now I’ll do whatever is needed.” In addition to work on the court, Davenport has watched DVDs of Keys’s matches, provided by her producers at Tennis Channel. Davenport said: “The player I see playing those matches last year, in certain parts of the year, doesn’t even seem like that same girl that we’re hitting with on court, if that makes sense. I’m very curious to see, as these tournaments come up that I’m going to with her, how she plays matches, and what goes through her mind. Because obviously that’s missing when you just train in the off-season.” Davenport, who was once a teenager whose potential outstripped her initial self-belief, sees similarities in Keys’s current stage of development. “She has that type of personality that you don’t always see in a player that’s supposed to do great things,” she said. “Some people believe they were born to do it, and other people, it takes them a little longer.” Though it took female champions like her a little longer to enter the coaching ranks, Davenport is thrilled. “It seems like the door needed to be opened for it to become O.K.,” she said, “and obviously Murray was the one who kind of broke that down. In both cases: first hiring Lendl, and then opening the door for the women now by hiring Mauresmo. Not all former great players are good coaches, and not all partnerships are a good match of personalities. Sometimes you have to get lucky; sometimes a player will take what they need to get out of it — who knows? But I think it’s great. It was exciting for me, even when I was just doing TV, to see Lendl around, and Edberg around, and Becker.” For Davenport, seeing a female player join the group was even more exciting. “I got goose bumps when I read Andy Murray’s press release on Mauresmo,” she said. “I mean, that’s great, it’s cool. It shouldn’t be that big a story, but it’s great. Hopefully we keep on bucking the trend, and having women out there as coaches. Having past players still involved in the game, I think it’s fantastic.”
