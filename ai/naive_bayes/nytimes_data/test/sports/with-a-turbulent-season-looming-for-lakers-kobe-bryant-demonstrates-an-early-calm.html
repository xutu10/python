With a Turbulent Season Looming for Lakers, Kobe Bryant Demonstrates an Early Calm
Bryant, once notorious for his hair-trigger impatience, has seemed to display more collegiality and tactful communication this season with teammates despite the Lakers’ dim prospects.

LOS ANGELES —  It was an unusual scene. Here was  Their 118-111 loss to their hallway rivals, the  “I couldn’t be more pleased in this loss, actually,” Bryant said. “I think we figured a lot of things out.” There was no sarcasm, no seething. Bryant, once notorious for his hair-trigger impatience — with teammates, coaches, the front office and any sort of losing — was now wrapping his arms around a moral victory, prompting a question about the last time he had felt so good after a loss. “Probably never,” he said with a shrug. If this is a Zen-like transformation or merely some late-career pragmatism, it helps explain the current state of the union between Bryant, 36 and coming off two serious injuries, and the Lakers, with a roster of flotsam and jetsam surrounding him. It is going to take continued compromises. And that may be the only item of interest with the Lakers this season: Will this good soldier still be so at ease with his circumstance in February, or will his desire to win another championship prompt him to ask for a trade? Bryant’s patience is being tested. He lost a kindred basketball mind with Steve Nash’s season-ending injury and lost a promising young talent he might mold when Julius Randle broke his leg. And then he lined up again against Chris Paul, another reminder of the trade to the Lakers that David Stern nixed. “I know him and I know he’ll stay professional about it,” Clippers forward Matt Barnes, who spent two seasons with the Lakers, said of Bryant. “You always want to see someone who’s had a historical career go out in the right way, but it doesn’t look like it’s going to happen that way. It’s going to be a long season for him.” Bryant can no longer carry a team, not the way he once might have been able to do over 82 games or even attempted to do when the Lakers lost by 18 to Houston and 20 to Phoenix to open the season. But on Friday, Bryant revealed how he can still influence a team — and a game. He whipped passes out of double teams. He guarded Paul. He blew past Barnes for a reverse dunk and later sold him on a pump fake. He stole the ball from Blake Griffin in transition. He sank a fadeaway 3-pointer in the corner over the shot blocker DeAndre Jordan and suckered him with a highlight reel pass fake before banking in a layup. He threw in a reverse lay in. And he kicked a pass out to Wayne Ellington, whose 3-pointer tied the score for the last time. When Bryant did not have the ball in his hands, he was often pointing the direction he wanted to see it move. When he sat on the bench, he did not keep his observations to himself. “They still take his lead,” Clippers Coach Doc Rivers said of Bryant, who had 21 points and 7 assists. “He gives that team toughness, he gives them resolve. I guarantee you, whether they play well or not, they’re not going to be a team that gives in, because Kobe never gives in.” What pleased Bryant the most was how  This was a different, more collegial, tact than he might have taken in the past, Bryant said. There were no death stares. “Absolutely,” he said. “A lot more teaching. A lot more communication as opposed to the players we had in the past. Here it’s really kind of teaching, how to get things down, how to deal with the emotional roller coasters that take place throughout the course of games, the challenge of things and figuring things out.” Midway through the fourth quarter, Bryant had Paul posted up on the block, and demanded the ball from Ronnie Price, the backup point guard who had the ball on the wing. But Price, sensing that Blake Griffin would be crashing down from the free-throw line to double-team him, instead fed the ball to Griffin’s man, Jordan Hill. He sank a long jumper, the last of his 23 points. A few minutes later, with the shot clock winding down, Lin waved off Bryant and hit an off-balance 3-pointer. What Bryant liked is having a teammate strong-minded enough to make his own decisions on the fly. “You have to be able to assert yourself, especially on a team I’m playing on,” Bryant said. “I don’t want chumps and I don’t want pushovers. If you’re a chump and you’re a pushover, I will run over you. And so it’s important for them to have that toughness and to say ‘I believe in myself. I can step up and make these plays, I can perform.’ I think that’s very important.” The Lakers, Bryant seemed to sense, will need much more of that this season if they are going to leave any kind of mark.
