Question Mark Shadows Derrick Rose’s Return to the Bulls
Rose, whose Bulls will face the Knicks on Wednesday, is coming back from two knee injuries, and whether he can still be a franchise player will be an intriguing subplot this season.

GREENBURGH, N.Y. —  Some basketball players have careers. Others have odysseys. Derrick Rose is on an odyssey. There was a time when Rose, the  Limited to 10 regular-season games since April 2012, Rose is expected to make it 11 on Wednesday night when the Bulls and the Knicks meet at Madison Square Garden. Season openers are always fraught with meaning. For the Knicks, the game will mark the official start of the triangle-infused Phil Jackson era. (Various adventures are sure to follow.) For Rose, though, his simply being on the court will come as a small triumph, one celebrated by much of the league. “I’m a fan,” the Knicks’ Carmelo Anthony said, “and I’m always going to be a fan of Derrick Rose.” Few players command more respect from their colleagues than Rose, the league’s most valuable player in 2011. Other players are aware of his unique gifts. They remember the player he used to be — the speed, the strength, the savvy — and they have seen what he has endured in his attempts to return to the court and reinvent himself and reshape his game. “It takes time to really get back to your full self,” said Amar’e Stoudemire, no stranger to chronic knee injuries. “You have to trust your body again, which doesn’t come easy.” Rose’s injury history is as worn as an old paperback by now, familiar to nearly everyone with even the most casual interest in basketball. After tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during the 2012 playoffs, Rose missed the entire 2012-13 season. He returned to the Bulls at the start of last season only to tear the meniscus in his right knee last November. The injury ended his season. Some players can relate to Rose’s struggles more easily than others. The Knicks’ Iman Shumpert, a fellow Chicagoan, tore up his left knee on April 28, 2012 — the same day, in fact, that Rose sustained his first knee injury. Unlike Rose, who took 17 months to return to the court, Shumpert was back by the following January. “For me, I wanted to play through it,” Shumpert said. “But he was in a totally different situation. He’s a franchise player. He was coming off an M.V.P. year. He couldn’t come back and be like, ‘I’m playing my way back in.’ He’s got to be the M.V.P. right away.” Shumpert, now entering his fourth season, has not been quite the same player since his injury. As he put it, “My last two years ain’t been perfect.” Persistent trade talks involving him played a role in undermining his confidence last season. But Shumpert acknowledged that the psychological hurdles coming off his injury were more challenging than the physical ones. It hardly helped, Shumpert said, that everyone was dissecting his game. He was putting enough pressure on himself. So he could only imagine what Rose — one of the league’s most visible players — was going through. “I saw how critical everyone was when he stayed out,” Shumpert said. “I came back sooner than he did, and then people were like, ‘You should have waited.’ It’s a no-win situation.” Not long after Rose entered the league as the top overall pick in 2008, it was apparent that few opponents could defend him. He was like a bowling ball with wings. Too quick to guard on the perimeter, Rose was too sturdy to stop around the basket. That was the belief, anyway. But no athlete is invincible, and nothing can mask the inherent dangers of the job. It can come apart in an instant. “Injuries,” the Knicks’ Jose Calderon said, “are the worst part of being a professional athlete.” They are a constant, looming threat. Last October, when the Bulls and the Knicks met in Chicago, Rose made his first regular-season appearance at the United Center since 2012. He was not exactly transcendent, not that anyone expected him to look polished. He missed 16 of 23 shot attempts, but there were flashes of brilliance. In the closing seconds, he lofted the game-winning floater over the outstretched arms of Tyson Chandler. “Phenomenal shot,” Anthony said at the time, shaking his head. Less than a month later, Rose went down in a heap against the Portland Trail Blazers. Surgery followed. Again. In his absence, the Bulls relied on defense but ranked near the bottom of the league in offensive efficiency. The Washington Wizards ousted them in the first round of the playoffs. The Bulls needed Rose, and he needed them. Rose has made consistent progress since the summer, when he played for the United States team at the FIBA World Cup in Spain. He was rusty. In nine games, he averaged 4.8 points while shooting 25.4 percent from the field. He was 1 of 19 from 3-point range. It was not vintage Rose. But it was the process — the mere act of getting up and down the floor — that was most important, and its benefits were clear when he joined the Bulls for training camp. In eight preseason games, he averaged 16.5 points while shooting 48.4 percent, including 43.3 percent from the 3-point arc. The rhythms of the game were coming back to him. “I’m in a great place mentally, spiritually and emotionally,” Rose told The Chicago Tribune. Kenny Smith, an analyst for Turner Sports, said he expected Rose to feel less of a burden this season thanks to the addition of Pau Gasol, who signed as a free agent, as well as the continued emergence of players like Joakim Noah and Jimmy Butler. “Coming back, the load isn’t as big,” Smith said. “If he had to come back and the load was the same, I think that would be too much.” For now, Rose appears to be handling what he can. It is a start. REBOUNDS Jose Calderon was limited in practice Tuesday because of a strained calf, but Coach Derek Fisher said he expected him to play against the Bulls. ... The Knicks exercised the third-year option on Tim Hardaway Jr.’s contract, which will pay him $1.3 million next season.
