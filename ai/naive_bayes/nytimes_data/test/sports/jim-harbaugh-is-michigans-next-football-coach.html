He spent part of his childhood there while his father, Jack, was an assistant under Bo Schembechler. Harbaugh played from 1983 to 1986 for Schembechler. “I have to tell you, it’s been a dream of mine to come back as a football coach to the University of Michigan,” Harbaugh, 51, said.

Dozens of former and current players also attended. “To have my son take over at Michigan is one of the happiest days of my life,” Jack Harbaugh said. “Just an amazing day for all of us.”
