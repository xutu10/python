San Francisco Giants and Pablo Sandoval Hoping to Stay Together
As San Francisco celebrated its third World Series win in five years with another parade, the team and Pablo Sandoval expressed interest in working out a deal to keep him around.

SAN FRANCISCO —  Pablo Sandoval walked up the stairs Friday as he brought up the rear of yet another Giants victory parade and immediately got stopped by Barry Bonds, baseball’s career home run leader. “Don’t walk by me,” Bonds ordered, pulling his fellow slugger into an embrace. Sandoval insists he wants to play the rest of his career for the  “I want to wear that jersey for the rest of my career,” Sandoval said. “I’m going to go from what my heart tells me.” As the Giants parted ways for another World Series-shortened off-season, the biggest question is whether Sandoval will be back in the orange and black to make another run at a title. San Francisco’s slugging, switch-hitting third baseman preferred to savor his third World Series championship for a little while rather than contemplating where he will be suiting up come 2015. Re-signing Sandoval, known as the Kung Fu Panda, is a top priority for the franchise, too. Larry Baer, the team’s chief executive, said, “Pablo’s a huge part of the family.” But it could take months for the Giants and Sandoval to strike a deal. “We’re going to do anything possible to keep it together the best we can,” Baer said. “Literally, when that last shot of confetti goes out, we’re going to be hunkered down after today. I think the fans believe we have a good track record along those lines. We’ve stayed pretty consistent in the approach.” The 28-year-old Sandoval batted .279 with 16 homers and 73 runs batted in over 157 regular-season games for the Giants, and .366 in the postseason, with seven doubles and five R.B.I., four of those during the World Series win against Kansas City. “I’d love to be back here, I love the fans, I love my teammates,” Sandoval said. “They taught me a lot of things, to respect the game and play the game right.” The sides traded offers last spring but failed to reach a deal. While Sandoval might listen to the highest bidder, he declined to answer when asked about accepting a hometown discount. The Giants might have to open the pocketbook to beat out clubs like the big-spending Boston Red Sox to bring him back. San Francisco’s $164.7 million season-ending payroll — sixth-highest in the majors — is likely to go up next season. The World Series most valuable player, Madison Bumgarner, will receive bonuses of $100,000 for the Series M.V.P. and $75,000 for the National League Championship Series M.V.P. San Francisco did it again in improbable fashion, finishing the season with 88 wins for second place in the N.L. West. They celebrated with a star-studded affair featuring Bonds and the Hall of Famers Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Gaylord Perry, Orlando Cepeda and Juan Marichal. The left-handed reliever Jeremy Affeldt was still overjoyed by the fact he received the Game 7 victory after an official scoring change. Bumgarner was initially given the win. Affeldt was drafted by the Royals and once considered quitting during his time in Kansas City, before getting a new start with the Giants. When he got word he was credited with the win, Affeldt and his wife embraced and cried. “It was just a very emotional thing,” he said, surrounded by his wife and three sons.
