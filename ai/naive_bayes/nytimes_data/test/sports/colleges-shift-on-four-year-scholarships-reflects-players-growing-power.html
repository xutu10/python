Colleges’ Shift on Four-Year Scholarships Reflects Players’ Growing Power
The one-year scholarship has come to be viewed as similar to an employment contract, while four-year awards are seen as more in the spirit of amateurism.

Earlier this month, the Big Ten announced that it would become the first conference to guarantee its athletic scholarships for four years, a change from the widely followed practice of offering a single-year scholarship that can be renewed. Effective immediately, the Big Ten will ensure that none of its recruited athletes — in any sport — can lose their financial aid because of injury, poor play or coaches’ judgment. Jim Delany, the league’s commissioner, said, “To make a four-year commitment and give student-athletes the security, it’s the right thing to do.” A handful of universities have announced similar intentions in recent months — Indiana, South Carolina and Southern California among them — and on Monday, the Pacific-12 said that it, too, would guarantee four-year scholarships. The Atlantic Coast Conference has also voiced its support, as has the  “These scholarship terms are about power and control,” said Allen Sack, a professor of sports management at the University of New Haven and a longtime N.C.A.A. critic, “and what schools are willing to give up.” As the N.C.A.A. continues to navigate a series of lawsuits aimed at amateurism, an effort to unionize and a vocal chorus of critics, the scholarship — which usually covers tuition, books, and room and board — has long provided a window into the complicated relationship between players and their coaches and universities. Once considered a violation of amateurism, the four-year scholarship was adopted by the N.C.A.A. in 1956 to curb prohibited payments to college athletes. A decade later, some colleges had soured on it. At the N.C.A.A. Convention in 1965, Oklahoma’s faculty representative voiced frustration that players could quit a team but keep their free rides. The rules of the scholarship were questioned later that decade when athletic departments became the targets of student protests, mostly by black athletes, including public accusations of racism at several universities. The sociologist Harry Edwards once estimated that black college athletes had prompted 37 protests in 1968 alone. Coaches, meanwhile, grew concerned with the challenges to their authority. In response to the unrest in athletic departments, the N.C.A.A. determined in 1967 that players’ scholarships could be canceled if they quit a team. With the changes, Florida’s football coach, Ray Graves, said he no longer had to “deal with troublemakers.” After Title IX, a federal law mandating gender equity in college sports, went into effect in 1972, universities that suddenly had to expand women’s sports programs looked for budget relief. Scholarships were on the chopping block in 1973: The number of football scholarships was capped for the first time at 105 per program, and scholarships were officially limited to one year. “The protests continued, and the protesters could still keep their scholarships,” said Dave Meggyesy, who played football at Syracuse from 1959 to 1963 and in the N.F.L. and wrote “Out of Their League,” a memoir critical of football culture during the era. “Officially making it one year was the ultimate mechanism for control because there was an implicit threat that it could be taken away.” Bill Curry, who coached at Georgia Tech, Alabama, Kentucky and Georgia State between 1980 and 2012, said: “I saw coaches treat the scholarship like a one-year contract. There were guys who routinely signed too many players and then dropped them.” Kevin Lennon, an N.C.A.A. vice president, said the association had been more focused on other benefits for athletes over the years. In the 1980s, players were allowed to receive need-based federal aid, and a recent rule change allowed for unlimited academic and career counseling, including laptops and internships. The one-year cap also remained in place, Lennon said, to maintain consistency with aid based on merit and financial need, which is distributed annually, and to preserve the flexibility to offer scholarships to walk-ons. In 1991, the N.C.A.A. made accommodations to allow severely injured players to remain on scholarship without counting against a team’s limit. And universities are required to have appeal policies in place for players whose scholarships are not renewed. “With the one-year grant, students would need to be fully engaged as students and fully engaged as teammates,” Lennon said. Not until 2010, when the Justice Department questioned the N.C.A.A. about the one-year scholarship, did the issue resurface. Lawyers wondered whether a cap on aid could represent an antitrust violation by limiting the choices of recruits. The same year, Joseph Agnew, a former Rice cornerback, sued the N.C.A.A. over the one-year scholarship cap after his scholarship was revoked by a new coach when he sustained a back injury. He appealed to Rice and won the right keep the aid for his junior year, but not his senior year. The lawsuit was dismissed. The N.C.A.A.’s executive committee acted in 2011, eliminating the one-year restriction. The reaction at many universities, though, was negative. During a period in which they could review the new rule, Indiana State wrote to the N.C.A.A. saying that a university could be “locked in” to a contract “potentially with someone that is of no ‘athletic’ usefulness to the program.” The Big Ten’s guarantee is contingent on players’ following team rules and staying in good academic standing. But Sack, the New Haven professor, said the practicality of the four-year scholarship, as well as the legality, was important. He said he saw the newfound momentum as a direct response to the Northwestern football team’s effort to unionize, though he said he supported the movement toward four-year scholarships, no matter the reason. “If you have four-year scholarships with the proper protections in place for the athletes, then it looks a lot more like an academic institution and less like an employee model,” he said. “So that’s a good thing.”
