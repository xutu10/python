Fantasy Football: Waiver Wire Priorities for Week 3
While it is unfortunate for star players to be hurt, injuries create opportunities that fantasy owners can capitalize on.
===
If last week was Kevin Ogletree week, this is most definitely injury week. Quite a few fantasy stars were lost in Week 2 with Jamaal Charles, Ryan Mathews, Robert Griffin III and Mark Ingram all going down with injuries (and that list does not include Doug Martin, who was injured beforehand). While it is unfortunate for star players to be hurt, injuries create opportunities that fantasy owners can capitalize on. Since Week 2’s injuries will thrust some players into fantasy relevance, I will switch up this week’s format and prioritize potential pickups. Most of these options are not season-long adds, but they will be more than useful for owners in need of a warm body for the next few weeks. I’ll be introducing a new ZIP code to the column a little later, but, for now, here are this week’s priority pickups, in order. The Priorities (Players who I would be using high waiver priorities and/or a good chunk of my FAAB dollars on this week.) Knile Davis, Kansas City Chiefs Davis is not available in many leagues, but he is worth burning a high waiver priority on for fantasy owners in shallower leagues. In two games filling in for Jamaal Charles (Week 17 in 2013 and Week 2 in 2014), Davis has averaged 24.5 carries, 80 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. That is an extremely small sample size, but he should get at least three starts — Charles is likely to be held out until the Chiefs’ Week 6 bye because of a high ankle sprain. Donald Brown, San Diego Chargers Brown is not sitting on most waiver wires, but he needs to be scooped up if he is. Ryan Mathews is set to miss at least four weeks with a sprained M.C.L. and Brown will step in as the 1A to Danny Woodhead’s 1B in the Chargers’ backfield. Brown has not done much this season, but he was able to find the end zone six times in the Colts’ final seven games last season and should get plenty of opportunity to provide his owners with RB2/Flex numbers while Mathews is out. Ahmad Bradshaw, Indianapolis Colts The demise of Trent Richardson might be a little overblown (he still had 79 rushing yards on 21 carries against the Colts in Week 2), but Bradshaw has badly outproduced T-Rich over the first two weeks of the season. The 27-year-old is averaging 0.35 fantasy points per snap, according to ProFootballFocus (15th among fantasy running backs), while Richardson is down at 0.22 points per snap. Bradshaw will probably not see most of the carries in Indianapolis because of his injury history, but he should be considered much more than a handcuff for Richardson owners at this point. Bobby Rainey, Tampa Bay Buccaneers Rainey averaged a ridiculous 6.5 yards per carry on his way toward finishing with 22 carries and 144 rushing yards in a Week 2 spot start for Doug Martin. Rainey is worth a pickup this week based on those numbers, but I would not advise going all in as Doug Martin is supposed to play against the Falcons on Thursday. The Others (These players fall into the next priority tier, but they can still make a difference if they fill a positional need.) Kirk Cousins, Washington Redskins With Robert Griffin III out for at least the next two months, Cousins will step in as the starting quarterback for Washington. During his Week 15 and 16 starts in relief of Griffin last season, Cousins averaged 15.5 fantasy points. In relief of Griffin last weekend, he put up 18 fantasy points (good for QB5 for the week) against the Jaguars and led all fantasy quarterbacks with a 12.2 yard aDOT (average depth of target), according to PPF. James Jones, Oakland Raiders Jones will have to take a trip to Revis Island (which is about as much fun as a trip to see the smoke monster on “Lost”), but he has easily solidified himself as Derek Carr’s most trusted target in Oakland. Even though both of his touchdowns have come in the final minutes, points are points and Jones has seen as many targets as guys like Julian Edelman, Pierre Garcon and Vincent Jackson through two weeks. Larry Donnell, Giants What to make of Donnell? One cannot argue that he is tied for the Giants’ lead in receptions and yards (and is only one short of being tied for the team lead in targets). His 17 targets through two weeks have him tied for fourth among tight ends, and it is not lunacy to say he will finish as a top 10 fantasy tight end. Niles Paul, Washington Redskins Everyone loved Jordan Reed as a breakout tight end this season, but it looks like we may have picked the wrong Washington tight end. With Reed out with a hamstring injury, Paul has emerged as a go-to target and put up impressive numbers (12 catches for 185 yards on 15 targets). He is third in aDOT (thanks again, PFF) among tight ends who have played at least 50 percent of their team’s snaps. He should be a solid fantasy start as long as Reed is out. Drop City (To pick up the options above, someone has to be dropped.) Tom Brady  LeGarrette Blount Riley Cooper
