Lack of Suitors for Winter Olympics Prompts I.O.C. to Change Bidding Process
Reform proposals the International Olympic Committee announced Tuesday are designed to make bidding for the Olympics, particularly the Winter Games, less daunting by making it cheaper and easier.

The Olympics went on sale this week. Maybe you saw the fliers? Don’t want to spend $50 billion on the Games, as ruble-rich Russia did to host in Sochi last February? The  You say you can afford only part of the Olympic price tag, and you’d like to share the cost with the city — or even the country — next door? Have at it! Looking to host an Olympics with your favorite sport, even though it’s not in the Olympic program? Don’t let that stop you! Just ask the I.O.C. to put that sport into your Games — baseball, cricket, Ultimate Frisbee, whatever — and it could be a done deal. In its bid to make hosting the Olympics more enticing, and to avoid potentially difficult choices —  The I.O.C. president, Thomas Bach, told me that it was nothing specific that prompted his organization to make public potential changes to the Olympics and Olympic governance that would, among other things, make bidding for the Olympics less daunting by making it cheaper and easier. Bach said the 40 reform proposals the I.O.C. announced on Tuesday — which included changes to the bid process and an Olympic digital channel that could give Olympic sports broader exposure online — show that the organization is just trying to keep up with the changing times and protect its brand. “Reforms have to happen when you are in the driver’s seat,” he said. “If you are hit by problems, then you are no longer in the driver’s seat and lose your leadership. So the moment to change is now.” He’s right. The Olympics aren’t dying — NBC Universal earlier this year paid $7.75 billion for the exclusive broadcast rights to six Olympic Games, from 2022 to 2032. But it is hard to say the Games are thriving when several promising bid cities have turned away from the process as if the Olympics were toxic. Four of the six cities that were in the running to host the 2022 Winter Games canceled their bids for reasons that included lack of political support, tepid public enthusiasm and the pervasive feeling that the I.O.C.'s long list of demands for bid cities was ridiculously unnecessary. First, Krakow, Poland, ran for the hills, then Lviv, Ukraine (which postponed its bid because of unrest in the country). In January, Stockholm backed down, and soon Oslo took itself out of the running, prompting sportswriters around the world to shed a tear because the winter wonderland that was the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics in Norway was just so wonderfully compact and postcard-perfect. That left the I.O.C. with two less-than-ideal choices: Beijing, which hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in an atmosphere rife with pollution and accusations of human rights violations; and Almaty, Kazakhstan, which has a poor report card on human rights, too. What it revealed was that few countries want to host a Winter Games. (The Summer Games retain plenty of suitors.) That should not come as a surprise. Even Russia’s costly investment in Sochi didn’t guarantee a legacy, not a positive one at least. In other Olympic cities, many venues, including the Olympic Stadiums in Athens and Beijing, are now abandoned and crumbling. So what good is it to have billions of dollars coming in from broadcast rights when nobody wants to host your party? For so many years, the I.O.C. thought its demands and its unduly strict rules would never be challenged, and that was a huge mistake. But here comes Bach, and perhaps the outlook for the Olympic movement isn’t looking so bleak. If his 40 proposals to revamp the Olympics pass at the I.O.C. session in Monaco next month, maybe the 2030 Olympics won’t have to be held at the North Pole after all. Bach, a German who won an Olympic gold medal in fencing, has already done more for the Olympic movement than the previous few I.O.C. presidents combined. He arrived in his job in 2013, in the middle of the controversy over Russia’s anti-gay legislation as the Sochi Games approached. He told me then that discrimination of any kind had no part in the Olympics, but it wasn’t just lip service. Last month, Human Rights Watch — which excoriated the I.O.C. for holding the Olympics in Beijing and Sochi — gave him and the I.O.C. a gold medal for promising to include antidiscrimination clauses in its future contracts with host cities. That was a huge moment. “I can’t tell you how hard it was for me to say nice things about the I.O.C., but I really had to,” said Minky Worden, the director of global initiatives of Human Rights Watch. “The reform process used to be glacial, but Bach doesn’t do it that way. He’s a breath of fresh air.” Now, though, Bach is being just as aggressive at trying to lure more cities into bidding for the Games. He said the process would have fewer demands and more suggestions, making it both friendlier and less expensive. One of Bach’s main proposals is that the I.O.C. will help subsidize the bidding process. He also has proposed relaxed rules, including allowing host cities to include a sport in their Games that might not be on the Olympic schedule already. (Pay attention Tokyo 2020: stop your complaining about baseball and softball, because it’s possible that those sports will be in your Summer Games after all.) Among the other suggestions announced Tuesday was that the I.O.C. would consider joint bids, or even bids proposing that events be held across a region if, say, two countries shared mountains — Chile and Argentina, unite! — or if two countries were too small to bid by themselves. (There’s hope for you, Luxembourg.) “It’s time for our rules to evolve,” Bach said. “And they have to, just like in the corporate world.” Bach said he expected all of the 40 proposed changes to pass. But in the Olympic world, sale or no sale, nothing is guaranteed. “Fingers crossed,” he said.
