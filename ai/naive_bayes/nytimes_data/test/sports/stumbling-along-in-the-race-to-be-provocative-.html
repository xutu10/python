Stephen A. Smith's Comments on Ray Rice Illustrate Problematic Trend in Media Commentary
The suspension of the ESPN host Stephen A. Smith for comments relating to domestic violence and the Ray Rice case exemplifies how opinions intended to prompt public reaction can backfire.

Stephen A. Smith will return to active duty this week at  Smith received what amounted to a 10-yard holding penalty last week because, while discussing  In public and private conversations, Smith has said he wishes he had been clearer. Too late. One thing you quickly learn about writing for and appearing on television is that fitting nuanced points into three- to five-second sound bites is like trying to fire a pass through three defenders in airtight coverage. The masters can do it; the rest wind up getting picked off. Or fired. Smith’s remarks are the latest example of how the line between being thought-provoking and merely provoking has become blurred and how thoughtful discourse has been compromised. At its best, commentary, inside and outside the world of sports, provides insight, makes sense out of confusion and finds balance in the midst of controversy. In the last 25 years, with the rise of sports journalists as news media stars, those who have traditionally been charged with providing perspective have often been the ones lobbing verbal hand grenades. Last month, a radio host in Boston unleashed a hateful attack on the Fox commentator Erin Andrews, calling her “gutless” and using an expletive. He also said Andrews should “drop dead” because he didn’t like her approach during and after an interview with the All-Star pitcher Adam Wainwright. When will all of this end? When consumers want it to end. For all the focus on the individuals who create the outrage, the reality is that the histrionics are intended not as much to facilitate debate as to draw, and keep, fans. As competition has escalated, news media outlets have become increasingly obsessed with their audience numbers. We want your eyes, your ears, your wallets. And what does the audience want? Debate? Diatribe? Outrageous behavior? The great benefit of writing is that it slows things down. As a journalist and a columnist, I have found that the most useful — and reassuring — part of writing is the editing process: vetting ideas, arguing, being forced to flesh out a point before it ever sees the light of day. Being asked, “Do you really want to say that?” But even print has been forced to metabolize at a much faster rate as each innovation increases our ability to respond in real time. The process has resulted in not so much to a rush to judgment as simply a rush: an effort to put something in front of the public first, and to change and clarify on the fly. As I moved around the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Boston last week, a number of aspiring sports journalists talked about wanting to be TV anchors and personalities. Understandably, many think the quickest way to do this is to be provocative and irreverent. I am amazed — and troubled — by the large number of 20- and 30-somethings who acknowledge watching and listening to sports programming as long as they are awake. Given the nonstop tragedies that dominate the “real” news, sports can offer a refuge from the “real world.” Indeed, sports has become a world unto itself. This makes it all the more imperative that what sports journalists and commentators say and write does not feed the most regressive parts of an industry that at its worst can be homophobic, misogynistic and racist. One of the highlights of the N.A.B.J. convention was a panel discussion featuring Andrew Young, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations. Young was never shy about voicing opinions. Fortunately for him, he voiced them in a more forgiving era. At the 1984 N.A.B.J. convention, Young described Walter F. Mondale’s presidential campaign as being run by a contingent of “smart-ass white boys who think they know it all.” Before last week’s talk,  “Mondale let the experts there take over the campaign and put the money into television and did not get out the vote,” Young told Prince, “and there were a lot of problems.” Had Young made his original remark in today’s environment, he would have been buried under an avalanche of social media reaction that would have drowned out the substance of his point. His remark would have been played and replayed; news shows would have built entire segments around the backlash. In today’s environment, Young’s comments would have become content and would have run until the audience had sufficiently gorged itself on the controversy. Heated debates around polarizing figures and polarizing quotations make for good copy and great TV. But do they lead to positive change? The scandal surrounding Donald Sterling, the Los Angeles Clippers’ owner, who was secretly recorded making racist comments, brought up a wide range of captivating issues, including blacks working in a team’s front office and players exercising greater influence in team affairs. But has anything really changed? If there is a lesson to be learned from the spate of suspensions, it’s that in our zeal to tap new markets and attract new readers, viewers and listeners, we relinquish a sliver of our conscience and our responsibility to at least try to create order out of chaos. As we chase dollars, we make progressively less sense.
