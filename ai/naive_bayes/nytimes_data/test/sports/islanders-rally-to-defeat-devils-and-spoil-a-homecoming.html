Islanders Rally to Defeat Devils, and Spoil a Homecoming
Keith Kinkaid, a Long Island native making his second career start, had 31 saves for the Devils, but it was not enough to hold off the Islanders.

UNIONDALE, N.Y. —  The  Keith Kinkaid, a native of Farmingville in Suffolk County, made 31 saves and nearly gave the Devils a much-needed victory. But Josh Bailey scored the decisive goal of a shootout to push the Islanders past the Devils, 3-2, on Monday and deny Kinkaid his first N.H.L. win. “It was a memorable game in a memorable place,” said Kinkaid, who had more than 50 family members in attendance. “I thought I played well. It just wasn’t enough.” The Devils had two chances to win in the shootout, but the Islanders’ Jaroslav Halak denied Damon Severson and Marek Zidlicky, and Bailey scored in the fifth round. “We keep the same focus throughout the game,” said Bailey, who also scored the Islanders’ first goal. “We knew we would have our chances. It feels great to contribute.” The Devils led, 2-1, until Matt Martin scored 10 minutes 45 seconds into the third period, skating down the right wing and snapping a shot past Kinkaid for his fourth goal of the season. Kinkaid recovered, though, blocking a Kyle Okposo shot on a power play in overtime to send the game to a shootout. Kinkaid, 25, who was making his second career start, had seven saves in the first period, including pad saves on shots by Ryan Strome and Nick Leddy during an Islanders power play. In the second period, Kinkaid allowed the goal by Bailey but denied the other 10 shots he faced, and in the third period, Kinkaid stopped Matt Donovan from his front early and made another glove save on a Strome shot with just over two minutes remaining. “He played really well,” Islanders Coach Jack Capuano said of Kinkaid. “A local guy, he kept his emotions in check and had a very good game.” Zidlicky, a Devils defenseman, opened the scoring 12:15 into the first on a power play, blasting a shot from the point past Halak. The longtime Islanders nemesis Jaromir Jagr, who has accumulated more points against that team in his career than he has against any other, and Scott Gomez, who recently returned to the Devils after seven seasons away, were credited with assists on the score. The same three players combined for the Devils’ second score, with Gomez receiving credit for the goal after his centering pass bounced off a cluster of skates and into the net 15:20 into the first. Another assist on that play gave the 42-year-old Jagr 61 goals and 91 assists in 105 games against the Islanders, out of his career totals of 710 goals and 1,065 assists in 1,503 games. Bailey cut the Islanders’ deficit to 2-1 at 1:51 of the second period with his fifth goal of the season. But that was about all the Islanders could muster against Kinkaid and the tight-checking Devils. “We kept our structure and kept playing hard,” Capuano said. “Give them credit.” Kinkaid joined the Devils as a free agent in April 2011 after two seasons with Union College. Having spent most of the past few seasons with Albany of the American Hockey League, he is getting a chance as Cory Schneider’s backup. Kinkaid grew up an Islanders fan and often attended games at their home rink, saying before the game that it was his dream to play at Nassau Coliseum, which the Islanders are set to leave after this season. His enthusiasm ultimately was not enough to carry the Devils (11-15-6), who were playing their league-leading 21st road game, including a 3-1 loss at the Coliseum on Nov. 29. The Devils started the season 6-3-2 but have since gone 5-12-4 while struggling to stay in the playoff race; Monday’s loss left them tied with Buffalo for the 12th-best point total in the 16-team Eastern Conference. The Islanders, on the other hand, coming off a rousing 3-2 home victory over Chicago on Saturday, are off to such a fast start that their long-suffering fans are already envisioning playoff games. The team won for the 12th time at home after recording only 13 wins at Nassau Coliseum last season. The Islanders (21-10-0) are also 9-0 in games that have gone beyond regulation. They are the only N.H.L. team without a loss in overtime or a shootout this season. “Guys want the puck on their sticks,” a smiling Capuano said of the team’s success in extra time.
