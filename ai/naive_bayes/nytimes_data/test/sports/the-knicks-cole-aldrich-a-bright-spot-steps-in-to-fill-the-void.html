The Knicks’ Cole Aldrich, a Bright Spot, Steps In to Fill the Void
Aldrich, a center who played at Kansas, has started five of the last six games, shooting 63 percent from the field.

SANTA MONICA, Calif. —  The distinction between tragic and comic is a particularly fuzzy one, if it exists at all for the  So it is nice that Cole Aldrich, the all-elbows-and-kneecaps center, has what is surely the most useful quality anyone on the team can have these days: the ability to laugh at himself. Aldrich does not take himself too seriously, which is evident not only in the way he plays the basketball, which is like a hockey enforcer; it is also apparent in the way he smiles: like a hockey enforcer. As a sophomore at the University of Kansas, Aldrich lost an upper incisor to an opponent’s stray elbow, forearm or fist — he can’t quite remember — and has never seen fit to replace it. He does have a prosthetic tooth, which is attached to a retainer, but he does not wear it when he plays, or all that often off the court. “As weird as it sounds, I think it brings a little lightness to the air,” Aldrich said Tuesday after the Knicks’ practice. “Somebody says something funny and I get a big old grin on my face, and somebody starts laughing.” Recently, Aldrich has lightened the mood in this grim season in another, somewhat unexpected, way: with his play. With Samuel Dalembert a lingering disappointment and injuries to Andrea Bargnani and Amar’e Stoudemire, Aldrich has been provided an opportunity. He has started five of the last six games, shooting 63 percent from the field. In the last two games, he had a combined 30 points and 26 rebounds. He has started more games in the past week than he has in the previous four years in the N.B.A. “There have been a few stretches over my career where I’ve had the opportunity to play here or there,” Aldrich said. “I take the same approach every time that it happens, which is go out there and play hard, rebound, play defense and score when given the opportunity.” Aldrich’s arrival in New York as a free agent a little over a year ago was Glen Grunwald’s last act as general manager. Grunwald was fired the next day. The Knicks were Aldrich’s fourth team in less than 12 months, and as Phil Jackson began to overhaul the roster, it was less than certain that Aldrich would return after his one-year contract expired in June. But when the Knicks hired Derek Fisher as coach, he thought Aldrich, his former Oklahoma City teammate, would be a nice fit for a franchise in need of a culture change: somebody with a solid work ethic who would be positive presence, whether he was awarded playing time or not. “He’s a great guy to have on a team,” Fisher said. “He’s not a guy that tries to always lead in a vocal way, but he’s definitely become somewhat of a leader just in his approach and being an example of how you work at what you do.” When the Knicks play the Clippers on Wednesday, they are expected to have Bargnani, who has yet to play this season because of calf and hamstring injuries. He made it through Tuesday’s practice without any problems. Fisher is also planning on having Carmelo Anthony, who sat out the second half of Sunday’s loss at Portland with a sore knee. Jackson observed the practice at the Boys & Girls Club of Santa Monica, which had photos on the wall of Fisher and his former Lakers teammates Kobe Bryant and Lamar Odom. On his way out the door, Jackson said he would be at Wednesday’s game. As Jackson assesses what parts will be useful — or trade fodder — next year, Aldrich could be an intriguing figure. His jumper may look awkward and his movement ungainly, but his recent production — and his ability to pass the ball in the midpost area of the triangle offense — have been a modest bright spot in a season with few of them. The way Aldrich throws his body — and limbs — around the basket, it is surprising he has not knocked out others’ teeth. At Kansas, he also sustained a broken nose, which is evident in the right turn his nose makes near the tip. As for the tooth, all he remembers is getting hit in the Big 12 opener against Kansas State in his sophomore season. “I was going up for a rebound and something hit me,” Aldrich said. “I had a mouth guard, but it broke the root three-quarters of the way up. There was a free throw, and my mouth started to bleed. My girlfriend, now my wife, was in the stands, and I go like this.” Aldrich smiled. “My mouth guard was all bloody. I subbed out a few minutes later, and the team dentist runs down and says, ‘Well, we’re going to have to extract it tomorrow.’ I asked, ‘Can I play?’ He said, ‘Sure,’ so I took a little Advil and went back out there.” Aldrich said he had had surgery to build a bone graft, into which a titanium rod was eventually screwed and a false tooth was affixed. But it did not take. “So a few years later, I was back at Square One,” Aldrich said. “My wife keeps telling me: ‘You need to get it fixed. You need to get if fixed.’ At some point, it will happen, I guess.” For now, though, Aldrich is content to carry on without it. He laughs at the jokes, does not mind the jack-o’-lantern cracks around Halloween and is happy to mess around with his false tooth. And if James Harden can have his beard, and Chris Andersen can have his Mohawk, Aldrich can have his identifying trait — one that, in a way, is a fitting symbol for the Knicks and the gap that remains between them and the N.B.A.’s elite.
