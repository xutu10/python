The N.F.L. Players Association is expected to appeal the indefinite suspension given last week to Ray Rice, the former Baltimore Ravens running back, after graphic video showed him punching his fiancée was released. The union has until 11:59 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday to appeal. George Atallah, a spokesman for the union, answered questions about the appeal and other matters concerning Rice’s case. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. That video was certainly disturbing to all of us, and we certainly don’t condone what happened, but we have an obligation as a union to our members to make sure that their rights are not infringed upon. It’s not only our fiduciary obligation to them, but it is required by labor law. The message should be clear that the incidents involving any one of our members reverberate and have a broader impact on all players. Q. A. We have examples in the past, most recently in the bounty case, where players were accused and punished for something that wound up not being true. We did not make a judgment call as a union of the substance or validity of the claims until we understood all the facts. For Ray or any other player, our job is to diligently and vigilantly protect the fairness and transparency of the disciplinary process. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. Q. A. They have also expressed an interest in finding out if their own due process rights were violated by the second suspension (of Rice) and they know full well that a pursuit of a fair due process claim against the N.F.L. in this matter does not equate to support for that type of behavior. Our executive committee and board of player representatives understand the role that we have to play very well.
