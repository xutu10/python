An Orioles Veteran Savors Playoff Runs 17 Years Apart
Brady Anderson, the Orioles’ vice president for baseball operations, played for the powerful 1997 team that lost the A.L.C.S. to the Indians in six games.

DETROIT —  Brady Anderson played 15 seasons in the major leagues, but in his career, the things that stand out the most for him happened in two Octobers. The first was in 1996, the season in which he hit an uncharacteristic 50 home runs but then watched his team lose to the Yankees in the American League Championship Series, thanks in part to a 12-year-old fan named Jeffrey Maier who turned a potential extra-base hit by Derek Jeter into a home run. The other came a year later, when the  “I had a long career,” Anderson said in a hallway of the visitors’ clubhouse at Comerica Park on Sunday as he wiped Champagne from his face following the Orioles’ division-series sweep of the Detroit Tigers. “But if I’m really forced to close my eyes and look back on my career, the memories that are most vivid are the playoffs. Not even close.” Anderson is now the Orioles’ vice president for baseball operations, with a role in almost every aspect of the current team. He stands as one of the most visible links between then and now, including all the losing years in between. And the long-awaited return to the A.L.C.S. definitely took him back to his own playing days. “I can almost remember it at-bat by at-bat,” he said of the 1997 playoffs, which ended with a stacked Orioles team losing the A.L.C.S in six games to the Cleveland Indians. “I can recall how I felt in different phases of each series. How I felt winning and how I felt losing and coming home. There is really nothing quite like it as a player, to experience baseball when there are only a few teams left.” Those memories include a three-games-to-one series victory over the Seattle Mariners in the 1997 divisional playoffs, with the Orioles overwhelming a high-powered Mariners team that had Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Martinez, Alex Rodriguez and Jay Buhner batting in the middle of the order. But those Orioles had Anderson, Roberto Alomar, Rafael Palmeiro, Cal Ripken Jr., B. J. Surhoff and a pitching staff led by Scott Erickson and Mike Mussina. The Orioles went wire to wire that season, never falling out of first place from opening day on. In all, they won 98 games under their veteran manager, Davey Johnson. The current Orioles team does not really have the same star power. It does have Adam Jones, a four-time All-Star in center field, and Nelson Cruz, the slugger and three-time All-Star at designated hitter. However, third baseman Manny Machado, perhaps the team’s most talented hitter, and starting catcher Matt Wieters have missed much of the season with injuries and remain sidelined. In addition, Chris Davis, the slugging first baseman, was suspended for 25 games on Sept. 12 for testing positive for amphetamines and has not played since. Not that the 2014 Orioles need to feel defensive. Under the guidance of Manager Buck Showalter, they won 96 games and ran away with the American League East by 12 games. It’s just that the 1997 roster stands out. Dan Duquette, the Orioles’ current general manager, said that when he started scrolling back over the Orioles’ lineup from 17 years ago, he shook his head at all the star power it possessed. “We have some stars, too,” he said of the current squad. “It’s just that some of them are just not with us now.” The 1997 Orioles, however, did have a weakness in the bullpen. In Game 2 of the A.L.C.S. against the Indians, Armando Benitez — who later went on to blow postseason games for the Mets — gave up a three-run home run to Marquis Grissom in the eighth inning, and Cleveland won, 5-4. In Game 6, the Indians clinched the series with a 1-0 victory when Tony Fernandez hit a home run off — who else? — Benitez in the 11th inning. Somehow, the Orioles banged out 10 hits in that game to the Indians’ 3, but never scored. With two outs in the bottom of the 11th of Game 6, Anderson singled in his final postseason at-bat — he finished 15 for 42 in the playoffs that year for a .357 average — but Alomar then struck out. That it was it for the Orioles in the postseason until 2012, when they made it under Showalter as a wild-card team and went out in the first round to the Yankees. This year, they’re still going. “When people talk about chemistry on teams, it’s totally overrated,” Anderson said. “But on this team, particularly, I think it’s fitting.” And if the Orioles keep on winning, people will begin talking about the last time the Orioles won the World Series. That, by the way, occurred in 1983.
