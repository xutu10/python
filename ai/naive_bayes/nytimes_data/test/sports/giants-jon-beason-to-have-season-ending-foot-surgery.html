Giants’ Jon Beason to Have Season-Ending Foot Surgery

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Middle linebacker Jon Beason, a cornerstone of the Giants’ defense, will have surgery on his right foot and miss the remainder of the 2014 season. Beason, who has not played a full season since 2010 because of injuries, was sidelined for three games this year and missed parts of three other games because of his injury. A year ago, he appeared to have revived his career with the Giants when he had 98 tackles in 12 games. Acquired in a midseason trade with the Carolina Panthers, Beason, who will turn 30 in January, solidified the Giants’ run defense in 2013 and became a respected, vocal leader on the field and in the locker room. After the season, the Giants signed Beason to a three-year, $16.8 million contract. But in a workout June 12, he tore a ligament in his right foot and sustained a fracture of the sesamoid bone. He missed all of training camp but did not have foot surgery. Beason was activated in time for the Giants’ season-opening game in Detroit but has had trouble staying on the field since. He did not play in any of the Giants’ three victories this season but tried to play in each of the Giants’ losses, and frequently aggravated the injury. When Beason started against Dallas on Oct. 19, the Giants thought he was almost completely recovered. But he left that game, too, and during the team’s bye week last week, team doctors determined that the best course for Beason was to have the season-ending surgery. Beason, who was also sidelined in the 2011 and 2012 seasons, finishes the year with 11 tackles and leaves the Giants to wonder if they can count on him to stay healthy — especially at the price they are paying him. For now, Jameel McClain, who was signed as a free agent to play outside linebacker, will take Beason’s place, as he has during much of the 2014 season. “We lose a great leader in Jon,” McClain said after Monday’s practice. “But I’m sure after the surgery he’ll be around to help us in meetings and on the sideline. I’m sure we’ll feel his presence.”
