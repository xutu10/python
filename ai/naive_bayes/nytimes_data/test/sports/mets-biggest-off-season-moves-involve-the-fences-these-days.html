Mets' Biggest Off-Season Moves Involve the Fences These Days
On Tuesday, General Manager Sandy Alderson unveiled the pitching-rich team’s latest attempt to win more games than it loses: It moved in the right-center-field fence.

In movable outfield walls the  Standing against the right-center field fence as a razor sharp sun peered over the top of  At season’s end, the team’s analysts carefully studied home run trajectories and decided to move in this fence by as much as 11 feet. Alderson offered a flurry of statistics to show that the Mets’ right fielder,  But. ... But. ... Speaking as a lifelong fan, I can attest the Mets do this a lot, reducing you to a stammer. “This seems counterintuitive to you?” Alderson said to a reporter; he sounded puzzled. “Our assumption is that this will not adversely affect our pitching.” Look, I love analysis-speak as much as the next baseball geek, all that ISO, wins above replacement and OPS patter. Statistical analysis can peel back the game’s secrets like skin off an onion. By definition, however, the number of home runs that opposing teams hit to a particular spot in a particular outfield in a particular city is a variable that changes from month to month and year to year. Then there’s the question of trying to breathe life into the career of Granderson, who will be 34 in March. Age offers relentless erosions. What if his high arcing fly balls — if I were rude I would call last season’s version glorified pop-ups — fall a few feet short next year? Will Alderson again wave his hands and bring in the fences? And what if Michael Cuddyer, the 35-year-old injury-prone outfielder whom the Mets just signed to play the outfield for two years for $21 million, hits a few too many balls that bounce off the left-field fence instead of going over it? What is the e=mc2 divided by Flushing Bay humidity and adjusted Cuddyer’s birth date that will revive him? None of the teams that journeyed to the playoffs last season featured corner outfielders as old as Cuddyer and Granderson. I have no doubt that they are, as Alderson insists, “good clubhouse guys.” (Note: For a couple million dollars, I guarantee I will be the greatest clubhouse guy in the history of Mets clubhouse guys, including handing out marshmallows at team campfires during West Coast road trips.) I harbor no doubt that when healthy, and playing in the thin air in Colorado, Cuddyer positively raked. Two years ago, in Colorado, he led the league in batting average, although he was helped greatly by an unusually high batting average on those balls in play. But the calendar and health problems conspire to toss up a flapping flag of warning. Cuddyer lost 108 games to injury in 2014; he lost 25 games in 2013; and he lost 58 games in 2012. That’s 191 games in three years. The trend line is daunting. Combine that with the fact that, as Baseball Prospectus notes, he “does not field well” and is best limited to a bottom–of-the-order hitter and, well. ... Did I mention that the Mets moved in the fences after the 2011 season, when they won 77 games and lost 85? The next year they were 74-88. Did I note the Mets’ analysis showed that Jason Bay was uniquely suited to hit in  What’s perplexing is that the Mets give signs of hewing to an organizational philosophy. They have drafted strong young arms and young hitters. And the coming seasons offer some reasons for hope. If the team’s Type A potential ace Matt Harvey is healthy and strides to the mound next March, the Mets’ top pitchers — Harvey, the rookie of the year Jacob deGrom and Zack Wheeler — could offer as fine a hard-tossing young threesome as any in baseball. Their bullpen is loaded with young fireballers. First baseman Lucas Duda hit 30 home runs and knocked in 92 runs. The young catcher Travis d’Arnaud gave signs of being a hitter. Juan Lagares, a quiet, muscular center fielder who runs like the wind, has a preternatural feeling for where baseballs will land. (The Mets closed out last season on a September hot streak, although you really should allow that gremlin of doubt who is knocking on your door to step into the foyer. The gremlin could offer this counterpoint: The Mets began winning only when they fell irrevocably out of the race. Mediocre teams do that sometimes.) Doing the math suggests the Mets should examine their spending habits. They keep up the pretense of being a small-market team that happens to play in the biggest market in the United States. In fact, they spend $15 million per annum on Granderson, $11 million on Cuddyer and, last year, $7.25 million on Chris Young, who hit not at all for the Mets. Put those contracts together and you end up with more than $30 million per year, which would allow you to purchase a terrific outfielder. I digress. The Mets’ management can resemble yogis in their insistence on standing baseball management practice on its head. Alderson suggests that when attendance rises, they will spend more. That is like a NASA administrator arguing that when Mars moves closer, Americans will go to Mars. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Alderson noted that fans liked home runs. “We’re talking about creating a little more excitement,” he said. “That’s not going to appeal to the baseball purists. But we need more than baseball purists to fill the ballpark.” Well, right, except maybe not. The San Francisco Giants last year drew 3.36 million people to their rollicking ballpark, and no one on that team hit more than 22 home runs. The Mets, in their glory days, featured pitching and more pitching, scrappy defense and a little bit of hitting. Dwight Gooden with his live snake of a fastball and his Lord Charles curve and Tom Seaver with his dirty knee and crackling fastball drew full houses. Last August I took my sons to Citi Field. I anticipated the usual banquet of cheap scalper tickets. In fact, young deGrom was on the mound, tossing fire, and the joint was jammed. We paid more and sat farther away than anticipated, and had a grand time. You want people to fill that handsome little park out there by Flushing Bay? Here’s a thought: Try winning.
