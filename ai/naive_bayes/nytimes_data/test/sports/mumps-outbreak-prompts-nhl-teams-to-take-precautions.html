Mumps Outbreak Prompts N.H.L. Teams to Take Precautions

Mumps is usually regarded as a childhood virus, but it has wreaked havoc in the N.H.L. this season. Players from four teams and two on-ice officials have been sidelined by the illness, with several cases occurring in the last few days. More players and personnel may contract mumps in the coming days and weeks. “That’s what makes mumps so difficult; the incubation period ranges from 12 to 25 days,” said Amy Parker Fiebelkorn, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. “Even before you develop symptoms, you can be infectious. When you think of the number of teams each team plays in that period, the potential is there for a lot of transmission.” One N.H.L. team doctor who has worked in various sports for more than 25 years said he had seen chickenpox and measles strike teams, but never mumps. The outbreak began in mid-October, when two Minnesota Wild players were found to have mumps. Five of the team’s players, all defensemen, have become ill, missing as many as eight games: Keith Ballard, Christian Folin, Jonas Brodin, Marco Scandella and, most recently, Ryan Suter. Some St. Louis Blues players were also sidelined by suspected but unconfirmed cases that emerged in October. In November, Corey Perry of the Anaheim Ducks was hospitalized for three days with a high fever from mumps; his teammates Francois Beauchemin and Clayton Stoner were also sidelined. The Rangers’ Tanner Glass missed games because of mumps, and another Ranger, Dan Boyle, was recently out with a suspected case. In addition, a referee, Eric Furlatt, and a linesman, Steve Miller, have been bedridden by mumps. In adults, the illness can be especially painful, with what Perry described as two nights of alternating chills and sweats. Other symptoms include swelling of the salivary glands in the cheeks and jaw and, in some cases, sharp testicular pain. The virus is transmitted through saliva, and although it can live on surfaces, it is primarily passed on through coughing, sneezing, spitting, talking and sharing utensils like water bottles — all common behaviors in sports. “The setting of a sports team, with very close contact between people, can facilitate the spread of infectious diseases,” said Dr. Walter A. Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta. In mid-November, the N.H.L.’s infection control subcommittee, made up of team physicians and trainers, sent recommendations to each club about locker room and bench behavior, similar to the standard precautions the league advises to prevent the flu. The subcommittee provided teams and players with information about mumps testing, vaccinations and booster shots, and advised them about C.D.C. guidelines calling for inoculations. A survey of most N.H.L. teams conducted Thursday and Friday showed that many of them had tested players, coaches and traveling staff members for the presence of mumps antibodies, and offered vaccinations and booster shots. The Rangers were among several teams that provided booster shots in the last three weeks. Coach Alain Vigneault recently suggested that anyone in contact with the team, including reporters, should be tested. Press officers for some teams, including Buffalo, Columbus and St. Louis, said no mumps booster shots had been scheduled. In the Blues’ case, the disease was believed to have run its course. But the long incubation period for mumps, and its communicability when an infected person is asymptomatic, suggest that the virus’s effects may continue. “It’s important for the teams to take a look at the vaccination records of the players and the staff to ensure that everyone is up-to-date or that they have other evidence of immunity,” Fiebelkorn, the C.D.C. epidemiologist, said. Anaheim has been identified by some as the center of the N.H.L.’s outbreak because the initial illnesses among the Blues and the Wild occurred after visits to the Ducks. But doctors caution that it is difficult to identify a particular place as the starting point for an outbreak. Fiebelkorn said the annual level of mumps occurrences nationwide had remained fairly consistent since 2000. “This year we’ve had quite a few smaller outbreaks, and Ohio had a large outbreak this year that was several hundred cases,” she said. “But on the whole, we have been fairly stable year to year.” In the N.H.L., however, the situation is far from stable. “The most important thing is for the N.H.L. to have a heightened awareness that mumps is spreading,” Fiebelkorn said, “so that if a player develops symptoms, a team can be quick to respond by isolating him and making sure the virus doesn’t spread any further.”
