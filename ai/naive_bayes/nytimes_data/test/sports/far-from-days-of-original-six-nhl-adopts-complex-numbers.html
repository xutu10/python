Far From Days of Original Six, N.H.L. Adopts Complex Numbers
With a wave of highly publicized hirings in the off-season, N.H.L. teams snapped up the best of a new breed of advanced hockey statisticians who have found ways to quantify the game.

Consider hockey: speed and grace mixed with collision and violence. A defenseman passes from the red line to a teammate arcing into the attacking zone, but the puck tips off his stick to another teammate, who tries a quick shot. It deflects off an opponent toward the net, but the goalie gets a piece of it, just as a checker flattens the shooter and the defenseman hops over the boards to be replaced. All this happens in two seconds. How can such chaos be quantified? These are not baseball’s batter-by-batter segments, or football’s down-by-down parcels. There are too many things going on in a hockey game, and too many players doing them too rapidly to easily calculate the inner mechanics of the game. Perhaps that is why it took hockey so long to develop the kind of advanced statistics that are popular in other sports. But with a wave of highly publicized hirings in the off-season, N.H.L. teams snapped up the best of a new breed of advanced hockey statisticians who have found ways to quantify the game. The 2014-15 season, which begins Wednesday night, marks the start of the N.H.L.’s Age of Analytics. “Advanced stats — back home in Toronto, that’s all people were talking about,” said Islanders center John Tavares, who spent his off-season in one of hockey’s world capitals. In those discussions one would hear excited chatter about zone entries, Corsi On and Fenwick Close — arcane and often bafflingly complex concepts that King Clancy could never have imagined. Last summer, the Edmonton Oilers hired Tyler Dellow, a lawyer and hockey blogger whose skillful data mining earned him thousands of followers on Twitter, where he is known as  The Toronto Maple Leafs, under their new president, Brendan Shanahan, made the biggest splash. They hired three analysts in their 20s — a writer, a mathematician and a chemical engineer — and created an analytics department. This from a team whose general manager, Dave Nonis, said last November he eschewed analytics because “we couldn’t find a system or a group we felt we could rely on to help us make reasonable decisions.” While the concept may have exploded over the summer, N.H.L. clubs have long used analysts both inside and outside traditional power structures. “Teams have been employing statistical analysts for years, but in the past they have been very, very secret about it,” said Gabriel Desjardins, the founder of the stats site  The new statisticians have been able to unlock many secrets of hockey, as Moneyball analysts once unlocked the secrets of baseball. By tracking shot attempts, they have been able to track puck possession for the first time, and determined that a team that shoots more, has the puck more, and wins more. Through examining individual ice time, they can tell which players match up best against the opponents’ best players. And by finding certain constants in shooting and save percentages, they can see which hot scorers are truly good, and which are merely on a lucky streak. Hockey’s swirling commotion defeated quantification for years, and the men who ran the game were equally distrustful of numbers. Organized hockey began in 1875, but it took almost 40 years for a concept as simple as assists to emerge. The N.H.L. did not keep track plus/minus until the 1967-68 season, and it did not record season shot totals until 1982-83. But in the background, an urge to analyze flourished. The pioneering Canadian hockey coach and thinker Lloyd Percival wrote the influential “Hockey Handbook” in 1951, the first serious effort at an analytical approach to the game. The Montreal Canadiens privately charted plus/minus through the 1950s and ’60s. The innovative N.H.L. coach Roger Neilson introduced videotape analysis in the 1970s. Well into the 1980s and ’90s, though, while Bill James was transforming baseball statistics, hockey fans had no access to anything more sophisticated than the deeply flawed plus/minus statistic. Hockey’s modern statistical movement was born in 1997, when the N.H.L. started using teams of trackers in every league city to record shot attempts, blocked shots, hits and other stats. Soon, amateur statisticians went to work on the data. Over the years, studies with titles like “The Shot Quality Fantasy” appeared, and bloggers like Mehta proved through statistics that shot blocking was a skill, not a random event. The blogs grew in sophistication, and in recent years many of their stats-based predictions have proved remarkably accurate. In 2011-12 Los Angeles lost more games than it won and barely squeaked into the playoffs. But a stat called PDO, the sum of a team’s save percentage and its shooting percentage, showed that it had had unusual bad luck in scoring goals, and was due for a rally. Sure enough, the Kings went 16-4 in the playoffs and  Late last season the Maple Leafs seemed headed for the playoffs, but the advanced stats community insisted that the team was playing over its head. Toronto went 2-14-0 to close the regular season and finished out of the running. Lou Lamoriello, the Devils’ president and general manager, said the team “didn’t want to get left behind” in the analytics revolution. Lamoriello said he was encouraged to hire a statistical analyst by the Devils’ new owner, Joshua Harris, whose other team, the Philadelphia 76ers, has been among the leaders in a similar movement in the N.B.A. The nature of the analytics goes well beyond mining play-by-play data for events. Most teams use their own spotters to track on-ice events, and several, including the Rangers and the Islanders, have upped the ante. They embed tiny sensors in players’ equipment to track movements, creating a GPS map of where each player skated in the game. “I use it personally a little bit — how many times I’m touching the puck in a game, where I’m touching the puck, how I’m making plays and creating opportunities,” Tavares said. “Those are good things to know. When you’re learning or trying to get better, you have to be open-minded, because there’s so much that’s unknown.” There is still much in hockey that is unknown, as Tavares said, but far less than there used to be. The frantic, swirling patterns of speed and violence are being identified, deciphered and read. The seeming chaos of hockey is being quantified. Ice-O-Metrics Goals, assists, plus/minus — how passé. Over the last decade or so, hockey statisticians have produced a new set of data to measure the sport more accurately. The statistics can be complex, but it is a complex game.
