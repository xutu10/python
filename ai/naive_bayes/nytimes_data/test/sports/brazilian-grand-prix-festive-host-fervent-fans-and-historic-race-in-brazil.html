Festive Host, Fervent Fans and Historic Race in Brazil
A look at what's happening in São Paulo during the Brazilian Grand Prix this weekend at the Interlagos circuit.
===
The Brazilian Grand Prix, held near São Paulo, is one of the most celebrated, festive and historic races on the  Unfortunately, however, for fans looking for activities anywhere except on the track — which is 25 kilometers, or about 16 miles, south of the city center in a somewhat dangerous suburb, with shanty towns, or favelas, not far from the track — there are no special events, no concerts, no fan attractions. The Brazilian Grand Prix is in fact the only race on the Formula One calendar at which there are no such extra fan activities, either in the circuit park area or in the city. But that does not mean that the only race in South America is of little interest for those seeking something other than the racing. The race’s host city has much to offer as a travel destination.  The racetrack, meanwhile, has one of the best spectator viewing setups of any circuit in the world, as it is laid out on naturally dish-shaped terrain that extends beneath the grandstands. Track Action  Of the competitions in the support races, the Porsche Challenge and the Porsche Cup will run each day. Track Fan Activities  Next to the circuit is the Interlagos karting track, which is worth a visit to see where many Brazilian Formula One drivers got their start. Those who once raced karts there include Nelson Piquet, Emerson Fittipaldi, Ayrton Senna and Rubens Barrichello. For spectators who plan to stay on after the race, there is a special event a week later at the Interlagos circuit: The Ayrton Senna Institute is organizing an Ayrton Senna Racing Day, which is a charity marathon around the track to raise money for the underprivileged. A park around the circuit can be used for walking, running or cycling, but it is usually closed during circuit events. With the area’s constantly changing weather conditions — the word Interlagos means “between the lakes” — it is advisable to bring all-weather clothes: a hat, coat, sun protection and umbrella. Special Events in the City  Nightlife and Tourism  The city has hundreds of movie theaters and nightclubs, more than 70 museums and a dozen cultural centers, 70 shopping centers and hundreds of thousands of stores, as well as 15,000 bars and 12,500 restaurants serving more than 50 kinds of cuisine. The meat barbecue restaurants, known as churrascarias, are a local institution. Fogo de Chão is the most traditional one, and it is frequented by Formula One personnel. The popular cocktail caipirinha,  The countryside around São Paulo is beautiful, replete with rainforests within driving distance. The Nossa Senhora Aparecida Cathedral is a one-hour drive north of the city. Ayrton Senna Soccer fans can visit the Morumbi Stadium, one of the largest in the world, which is home to the São Paulo Football Club. Where To Stay  Ticket Prices
