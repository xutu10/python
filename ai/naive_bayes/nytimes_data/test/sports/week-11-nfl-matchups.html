Week 11 N.F.L. Matchups
This week’s games feature a trip to Lambeau Field for the Philadelphia Eagles, who are playing behind a resurgent Mark Sanchez, and will face a Green Bay Packers team that is 41-10 when Aaron Rodgers starts on their home field.

Eagles   4:25 p.m. Sunday Line: Packers by 6 ½ The  The last two games have been all about redemption for Sanchez, who spent his years with the Jets under a microscope. Most considered Sanchez an epic failure when he left the Jets, despite his early promise and poise. Now, Sanchez’s ability to run Philadelphia’s fast-paced offense while Nick Foles is injured has many wondering whether there is more to him than he has previously displayed. But expectations should be tempered as Sanchez heads to Lambeau Field in Green Bay, where the home-field advantage carries more weight than anywhere else in the world as long as Aaron Rodgers is the Packers’ quarterback. In the regular season, Rodgers is 41-10 as a starter at Lambeau. On Sunday, the high temperature in Green Bay is expected to be in the 20s, which would render a stadium rarely kind to visiting teams even more inhospitable. At home this season, the Packers are 4-0 and have outscored their opponents, 166-65. The team’s defense, far improved from a season ago in terms of defending the pass, has held opposing quarterbacks to four touchdown passes at Lambeau. “We like playing at home,” Coach Mike McCarthy said in what seemed like an understatement. “We want to play as many games as possible here.” Sanchez, who looked sensational in a start against Carolina on Monday, has always struggled with turnovers. The Packers, with the N.F.L.’s third-best differential between giveaways and takeaways, will undoubtedly look to exploit that weakness as they try to secure better footing in the N.F.C. playoff race. Pick: Packers Patriots (7-2) at Colts (6-3)   8:30 p.m. Sunday Line: Colts by 2 ½ Tom Brady has taken New England to the  “Their offense is doing a great job this year,” Brady said of the Colts. “They score a lot of points, especially at home. He’s kind of the ringleader. He does a lot of things I wish I could do.” Luck is certainly having a season to remember for Indianapolis. His N.F.L.-leading 3,085 passing yards trail only Peyton Manning’s 3,249 in 2013 for the record through nine games of a season. Luck is 737 yards short of his total in 16 games last season. But Brady has always been more about wins than about statistics, and with Rob Gronkowski fully healthy, the Patriots’ offense will easily be able to keep up with the Colts. Pick: Patriots Lions (7-2) at Cardinals (8-1)   4:25 p.m. Sunday Line: Cardinals by 1 Arizona’s response to Carson Palmer’s season-ending knee injury should be fascinating. The Cardinals have the best record in the N.F.L. largely because of their suffocating defense, which makes it almost impossible for opposing teams to establish a rhythm. When Palmer missed three games early this season, they went 2-1 with Drew Stanton in his place. But the Cardinals’ morale took a hit when they lost Palmer, their offensive leader, and that has the potential to affect all facets of their game. With a Detroit team that is firing on all cylinders coming to town, the Cardinals do not have enough time to adjust to their new circumstances. If Arizona’s defense does not take a step back, it is hard to imagine that the team will collapse. But a week after the Cardinals were discussing the possibility of playing in a Super Bowl at home, their expectations for the season have to be radically adjusted. Pick: Lions Seahawks (6-3) at Chiefs (6-3)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Chiefs by 2 Seattle has been a mess of distractions this season. But instead of talking about all of the drama last week, the Seahawks put their offense on the back of running back Marshawn Lynch, who almost never talks, and rode him to a big win. Lynch had 140 yards and a career-high four touchdowns, and Russell Wilson became the second quarterback to have three 100-yard-rushing games in one season as Seattle defeated the Giants, 38-17. Kansas City should put up more of a fight, but if the Seahawks keep their commitment to the running game, their stellar defense will take care of the rest. Pick: Seahawks 49ers (5-4) at Giants (3-6)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: 49ers by 4 ½ Patrick Willis is out for the season. NaVorro Bowman still does not know when he will return. For most teams, the loss of one All-Pro middle linebacker would be crushing, but San Francisco’s 3-4 defense has allowed the second-fewest yards in the league without Willis and Bowman. In a testament to the 49ers’ depth, the rookie Chris Borland has played exceptionally well while helping to fill the gigantic hole in the middle of the field, and his fumble recovery in overtime won the Week 10 game against New Orleans. If Borland can keep up the excellent work, and the expected return of Aldon Smith can solidify the pass rush, San Francisco might be able to salvage a season that once seemed to be slipping away. Pick: 49ers Bengals (5-3-1) at Saints (4-5)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Saints by 7 ½ It is hard to imagine a quarterback performing much worse than Cincinnati’s Andy Dalton did against Cleveland in Week 10. His line of 10 for 33 passing for 86 yards with three interceptions produced a quarterback rating of 2.0. Among quarterbacks with 30 or more passes in a game, it was the fifth-worst rating since 1960. The good news is that only $25 million of Dalton’s $115 million contract, which he signed in August, is guaranteed. Pick: Saints Broncos (7-2) at Rams (3-6)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Broncos by 10 ½ Robert Quinn and the St. Louis defense have come alive in terms of getting to the quarterback in recent games. But on Sunday they will be chasing Denver’s Peyton Manning, a seemingly statuesque passer who uses his ability to change plays at the line of scrimmage and release the ball quickly to avoid sacks. Despite a big and slow appearance, Manning was sacked just 18 times in 16 games last season, and he has gone down nine times this season. Given that the Rams’ defense provides little other value, and that the journeyman quarterback Shaun Hill has been reinserted into the starting lineup, this game could become ugly quickly. Pick: Broncos Vikings (4-5) at Bears (3-6)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Bears by 3 ½ “This has been a very disturbing stretch of three weeks,” Chicago Coach Marc Trestman said, and he was not kidding. The Bears lost to New England, 51-23; had a bye; and were routed by Green Bay, 55-14. A franchise historically known for defense, the Bears had allowed 50 points or more seven times in 1,048 regular-season games from 1940 to 2013. Pick: Vikings Texans (4-5) at Browns (6-3)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Browns by 3 ½ Ryan Mallett threw 32 touchdown passes in 2010, which was his third and final college season. Since then, he has four passes as a professional. The last time he threw a pass was 2012, when he was Tom Brady’s backup for New England. Mallett came in for mop-up duty in a blowout win over Houston, and his lone attempt was intercepted. Named Houston’s starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, he will probably have to shake off some rust after all that inactivity. Pick: Browns Falcons (3-6) at Panthers (3-6-1)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Falcons by 1 Atlanta and Carolina have realistic playoff hopes, which is more an indictment of the N.F.L.’s division system than an accurate measure of either team’s quality. The Panthers have been so bad that some have speculated that Cam Newton is hiding injuries. Newton insists that is not true, which means Carolina might actually be this bad. Pick: Falcons Buccaneers (1-8) at Redskins (3-6)   1 p.m. Sunday Line: Redskins by 7 ½ Two seasons ago, the thought of having to defend the decision to start Robert Griffin III over Colt McCoy would have been laughable. Yet DeSean Jackson was not the only person of late to find himself in that position after McCoy lost his job despite leading Washington to two wins. Even with his injury history, Griffin offers the most upside for the team. And against Tampa Bay, which consists of Gerald McCoy and not much else, Griffin should be able to get a win of his own. Pick: Redskins Raiders (0-9) at Chargers (5-4)   4:05 p.m. Sunday Line: Chargers by 10 ½ San Diego has lost three consecutive games, with nearly everything going wrong. Philip Rivers lost the magic he possessed while leading the Chargers to a 5-1 start, they suddenly struggled to run the ball, and their defense was beaten badly in a shutout against Miami in Week 9. Nevertheless, they are double-digit favorites against Oakland, which speaks volumes about the hopeless Raiders, who appear to be on the way to their 16th consecutive defeat. Pick: Chargers Steelers (6-4) at Titans (2-7)   8:30 p.m. Monday Line: Steelers by 6 ½ Pittsburgh might be the N.F.L.’s most confusing team. In Weeks 8 and 9, the Steelers scored a total of 94 points in beating Indianapolis and Baltimore. The same team lost to Tampa Bay in Week 4 and was stunned by the Jets in Week 10. Pundits have often talked about teams that play up or down to their competition, but this is getting out of hand. After the Steelers’ 20-13 loss to the Jets, Ben Roethlisberger insisted that a pregame visit by the pop star Justin Bieber had not cursed the team. Since nothing about this Pittsburgh season makes sense, it is nearly impossible to predict which team will show up. But even if they are not at the top of their game, the Steelers will be able to take care of Tennessee. Pick: Steelers
