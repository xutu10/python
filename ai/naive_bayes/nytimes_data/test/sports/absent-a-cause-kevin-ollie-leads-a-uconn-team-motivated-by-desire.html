Absent a Cause, Kevin Ollie Leads a UConn Team Motivated by Desire
For Ollie and his young Huskies team, it will be business as usual as they set out to retain their N.C.A.A. title.

The Kevin Ollie story keeps getting better. After growing up in a tough part of the Los Angeles area, Ollie went on a basketball scholarship to the  How can the next chapter top that? “It’s a great accomplishment, and it feels good,” Ollie said during a recent phone conversation. “But it’s back to business as usual. I’m going to work just as hard because I like the taste that was in my mouth after the championship, and I want to taste it again.” Ollie was named UConn’s coach in September 2012, with the program barred from the  Last season’s Huskies were one of the most refreshing teams in college basketball. They were not a squad of one-and-dones dribbling through the semester, biding their time until the  The players’ resolve was so strong that as the team stood on the podium after clinching the title, Napier fired one final salvo at the N.C.A.A. “Ladies and gentlemen, you’re looking at the Hungry Huskies,” he said. “This is what happens when you ban us.” The adults at UConn brought the N.C.A.A. sanctions on themselves; the players, admirably, stuck together and turned a negative into a spark. This season, Ollie is leading a younger team that starts three sophomores and a freshman and has no discernible cause. The Huskies opened with a victory at home against Bryant on Friday, a night when the Huskies’ championship banner was unfurled and their championship rings were distributed. This week, UConn will participate in the Puerto Rico Tip-Off. “You go into this season with the same mind-set,” Ollie said. “It’s not about being an underdog; it’s about us getting better.” He added of last season’s title run, “It feels good, but at the same time, we’ve got other mountains to climb.” Identifying those mountains will be the challenge. In his first two seasons coaching the Huskies, Ollie had a built-in inspirational trigger: It was them against the world, UConn versus the N.C.A.A. What is this season’s mission? Ollie said it was teaching a new team the process of building something great. Last season, there may have been teammates who were not enthralled with one another, players who wanted different roles. But they made a commitment to playing as a team in order to achieve their goal. Only one of this season’s Huskies, the senior Ryan Boatright, was in the starting lineup for the title game. “There’s a lot of self-correction that Ryan has to do to take the pressure off the young guys and not get frustrated,” Ollie said. “And I can’t get frustrated because it is a younger group; they haven’t been in these roles. I want them to fall in love with the process and not the prize. I don’t want to be the best team right now. I want the best team in March and April.” After last season, there were rumors that Ollie might take the Los Angeles Lakers’ coaching job, which was vacant at the time, but in May, he signed a new five-year contract with UConn worth $2.8 million a year, more than doubling his salary. “They were just rumors,” Ollie said of the speculation he would head to the Lakers, a team he grew up a fan of. “It’s definitely something that you look at and say, ‘Man, what if?’ But I have a great job at the University of Connecticut; I have a great connection with the fans; I’m raising two children. I’m really enjoying myself.” Ollie may one day go to the pros to take advantage of the better paycheck, the better talent and the more glamorous lifestyle. For now, though, he is the perfect coach for his young players. “I can make a difference here,” Ollie said. “A good leader can inspire others to dream great dreams. We have an opportunity to do that as college head coaches.” He added, “That really gives me drive.” As the defending champion, UConn will be put to the test in each of its games. But as a 13-year N.B.A. veteran, Ollie knows more than most that being aggressive and making one’s own breaks are key ingredients to success. “People are going to come at us hard,” he said. “But we’re going to come at them, too. We’re not sitting back and waiting for somebody to hit us.” Lacking the drama of a mission or a cause, Ollie will hammer home a message that has guided him from California to Connecticut: Stay humble, believe in yourself, work every day as if it’s your last, and always play as if you’re trying out for the team.
