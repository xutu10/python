Winless Giants See Reasons for Hope
The Giants were so inept in the preseason and so dominated in a season-opening rout last week in Detroit that they were buoyed by a near victory Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The winless Giants on Monday learned that one of their prized free-agent acquisitions, the nickel cornerback Walter Thurmond, would be lost for the season with a torn pectoral muscle. Jon Beason, the middle linebacker and a leader on the defense, has also been added to the list of injured players. So why were there so many smiles in the locker room Monday afternoon? Strange as it may sound, the Giants were so inept in the preseason and so dominated in a season-opening rout last week in Detroit that they were buoyed by a near victory Sunday against the  The Giants had a 14-10 lead in the fourth quarter. They mounted a 12-play drive in the final minutes that almost tied the game. The pass rush was fierce at times. The offensive line, for the most part, kept  Such are the positives that a team will grasp at to pull itself out of the woeful reality of an 0-2 record. But the Giants, despite the 25-14 loss to the Cardinals, were adamant about being hopeful. After weeks of treading water — if not outright drowning — they said they were on their way to finding some firm footing. “I saw stability; something we can build on and move forward,” Manning said. “Things are not snowballing in the wrong direction. Guys are doing the right things. We’re not having breakdowns. We’re not having guys running the wrong routes. We’re not having guys doing the wrong things that are leading to mistakes. We made good plays; we’ve just got to make more of them.” Not every team in professional football celebrates something as elementary as “not having guys running the wrong routes,” but Manning’s point was nonetheless felt throughout the team. “I think we’re at the point where we just need one win to get a little confidence and then we can take off and win a bunch more,” safety Antrel Rolle said. “We need a win quick, but it’s not too late.” Coach  “We are getting closer,” Coughlin said. “We just have to eliminate these bizarre events which take the heart right out of you.” Coughlin was especially referring to the fourth-quarter fumble by running back Rashad Jennings at the Cardinals’ 15-yard line as the Giants appeared on the verge of possibly tying the game. They had pieced together 11 mostly proficient plays, a drive that was undone when Jennings slipped to the turf and had the football jarred loose without contact from a defender. Manning called the fumble “weird,” but preferred to focus on the overall picture of an offense that no longer seemed under siege. Just a week ago, the focus was on Manning and whether he would ever be able to run the new West Coast offense. He completed 13 of his first 15 passes and 26 of 39 for 277 yards. At times, he looked smooth and fluid. “It felt good to get into a good rhythm and to have good answers to what I saw out there,” Manning said Monday. “A comfort level is building.” Thurmond will be replaced by Trumaine McBride, who played well last season when the Giants had to weather several injuries to the defensive backfield. Zach Bowman is another choice. The Giants are fortunate to be relatively deep in the secondary. They are not flush with linebackers. Beason reinjured his right foot that had kept him out of training camp. It is not clear how long Beason will be unavailable, but the Giants were talking Monday as if he would at least miss Sunday’s game with the Houston Texans — if not longer. Another regular, Jerrell Jernigan, the third receiver, is being evaluated by the medical staff for a midfoot sprain. Preston Parker, who had one catch for 29 yards Sunday, would become the team’s third receiver if Jernigan cannot play. Asked about the gloomy mood of fans, scores of whom exited MetLife Stadium before Sunday’s game ended, Coughlin made an impassioned plea for the fans’ support. “I would like in an ideal world that they would stay and remain as upbeat and positive as they possibly can because of the way they affect the young men who are on the field,” Coughlin said. “They are fans. They bleed and they live and die with circumstances. It wasn’t good yesterday, but it was better. It wasn’t the end result that everyone was looking for. But I would say that we need them, we need them to be upbeat.” Coughlin continued: “I don’t see this as being a reason for them not to be, not if they understand what our task and our goal is — to toughen up. Let’s go. Come on. Stop beating ourselves.”
