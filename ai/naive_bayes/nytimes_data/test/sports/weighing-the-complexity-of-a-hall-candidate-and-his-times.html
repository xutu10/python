Weighing the Complexity of a Hall Candidate, and His Times
Perceptions of Dick Allen’s personality as a player should not prevent his being voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame through the Golden Era ballot on Monday.
===
Dick Allen may be one of the greatest players not enshrined in the  He played 15 seasons with the Phillies, the Cardinals, the Dodgers, the White Sox and the Athletics. He won the National League rookie of the year award in 1964 for his .318 batting average, 29 homers and 91 runs batted in. Over the next seven years, he batted over .300 three times, averaging almost 30 homers and more than 90 R.B.I. Then, in 1972, he was the American League most valuable player with the White Sox, with 37 homers, 113 R.B.I. and a .308 average. Allen is one of 10 finalists on this year’s Golden Era ballot. A 16-person committee will announce its decision Monday at baseball’s winter meetings in San Diego. “I’m humbled, and I’m embarrassed,” Allen said last week in a phone interview. “Baseball is a team sport, and for me to go out in the forefront is a little embarrassing. Where are the other guys, and what do they get? It takes all nine of us to be successful. It’s all of us or none of us.” I went through high school thinking that Dick Allen was a sports villain. He was often portrayed as surly and combative, though the complexity of the man was rarely acknowledged. I had not yet learned to be skeptical of what I read and to consider the source before forming an opinion. “He was his own man, and you weren’t supposed to be your own man if you were black back in those days,” said the Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan, one of the 16 members who will vote. “I played against him a lot,” Morgan said. “I was always impressed with him. He could hit. He could really hit. It’s a hard thing, though, because as you know, he wasn’t a favorite of the writers. He didn’t talk to them a lot.” Allen established a defiant tone to his career in 1963 when he was assigned to play for the Phillies’ Class AAA farm team in Little Rock, Ark. He was 21, and the South was an especially brutal place. Allen was unprepared for what awaited him. On opening night, 7,000 fans squeezed into Little Rock’s Ray Winder Field to watch Allen become the first black player for the Arkansas Travelers. There were all kinds of unwelcoming signs outside the stadium. One said, “Don’t Negro-ize Baseball.” The first pitch was thrown out by Gov. Orval Faubus, who in 1957 tried to bar black teenagers from attending Little Rock’s Central High School. For a young man from Chewton, Pa., the experience was terrifying and overwhelming. Allen wanted to go home. But when he made the collect call to his mother, she was having none of it. “She said: ‘Put that phone to your ear. Can you hear me?’ ” Allen recalled. “ ‘God’s given you a talent and a place to show it. If you don’t use it, you’re not being disobedient to me; you’re being disobedient to God.’ ” Allen said she told him, “Don’t you let them drive you out.” During the next two days, Allen took extra batting practice and worked on hitting from both sides of the plate. He discovered a resolve that would sustain him for the rest of his career. “If I’m going to die, why not die doing what God gave me a gift to do?” he said he vowed in Little Rock. “I’ll die right there in that batter’s box without any fear.” From then on, hostile fans — in Arkansas and in Philadelphia — had no chance. Allen would not be broken. He would march to the beat of his own drummer, convention be damned. By the end of his stay in Arkansas, fans voted Allen the Travelers’ most popular player. In 1964, with the Phillies, he was named rookie of the year. But during the next few seasons, he battled the Philadelphia news media, his weapon of choice being silence. There were incidents — a fight involving Allen and a popular white player that led to the other player’s dismissal. He outlasted two managers. He insisted on doing things his way. He was late to games. There were times he would have a beer — or two — before he played. He dressed in his own area, away from the team. The fans, fueled by the news media, turned on Allen, going so far as to throw objects at him in the outfield. Allen made it known that he wanted out of Philadelphia. He conducted a two-year campaign to force a trade, including waging a 26-day strike that prompted a message from President Nixon saying that he should get back to work. Allen said he sent a telegram to the president, essentially advising him to stick to running the White House. Nothing worked. Allen was too valuable. A week after the 1969 season, Allen finally got his wish. He was sent to the Cardinals in a package deal in which center fielder Curt Flood was to head to the Phillies. Flood refused to report to Philadelphia, landing the first major blow against baseball’s reserve clause. After an All-Star season in St. Louis and a solid year with the Dodgers in 1971, Allen joined the White Sox and had his M.V.P. year. In 1974, when he was the American League’s highest-paid player, Allen abruptly left the White Sox in September and announced his retirement but still led the league home runs. The White Sox sold his contract to the Atlanta Braves, but Allen refused to report. He was dealt to the Phillies in May 1975. “I could have handled things a little better,” Allen said. “But I wouldn’t have changed a thing. I said what I said, did what I did, meant what I meant — and I’ll stand behind every bit of it. “ The Dick Allen story has never been solely about statistics, but about perception and forgiveness. Allen said he had long ago forgiven those fans in Little Rock and Philadelphia for the insults and epitaphs. The members voting in San Diego should follow suit. Let bygones be bygones, and give a worthy candidate a long-overdue salute.
