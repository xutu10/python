Storm Gives the Bills a Snow Day, and a Logistics Headache
With Ralph Wilson Stadium already covered by four feet of snow, the Bills were unable to practice in preparation for Sunday’s scheduled home game against the Jets.

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. —  Allen Iverson, the former point guard of the Philadelphia 76ers, questioned the value of practice in a 2002 rant that became as memorable as anything he did on the court. The  With Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, N.Y., already covered by four feet of snow and with a travel ban in place, members of the Bills were unable to practice on Wednesday in preparation for Sunday’s scheduled home game against  Bills Coach Doug Marrone, in a conference call with reporters who cover the Jets, said conditions in the Buffalo area were so bad that the game plan for Sunday — if the stadium can be cleared by then — was not foremost on his mind when he communicated with his players. “Our first thought when we talk to players is making sure they are safe and making sure they have power,” Marrone said. “We’re here to support them and their families.” Marrone said he reached his office at 1 Bills Drive on Tuesday night after being stranded for about 12 hours, first on the New York State Thruway and later outside Mercy Hospital in South Buffalo, a little more than five miles from the stadium and the training complex next to it. “The hardest part was being in front of a hospital,” he said of watching storm victims being brought to the emergency room. “It makes you realize a lot of other things that are more critical than me getting to the stadium.” Marrone said he put football aside to aid the rescue effort, whether it meant pushing cars out of ditches or simply offering the inside of his vehicle to a passer-by in need of warmth. The team, meanwhile, used Twitter to seek help as it faced the task of having the stadium ready for Sunday’s scheduled 1 p.m. kickoff. It tweeted: “Want to help clear the Ralph? We’re looking for snow shovelers. Pay is $10/hour + game tickets. Call 716-636-4840 for details.” Andy Major, the Bills’ vice president for operations, said the team hoped to augment its grounds crew of 15 full-time workers with at least 500 volunteers in a round-the-clock effort. Even then, it appears there may not be enough time to remove what Major estimated as 220,000 tons of snow from the 22-acre stadium and its grounds. “A foot of snow, you can probably clear the whole place in a three-day period,” Major said. “We’re talking four feet now, plus another two feet coming. We know the guys and gals that are helping us out now are stressed out.” Michael Signora, an N.F.L. spokesman, said the league was monitoring the situation. “We are working with the Bills to determine the status of the stadium,” he wrote in an email. “If a change to the schedule needs to be made, the league will make the decision, working closely with the club and local authorities.” Whenever the game is played, it will be critical to the Bills if they are to end a playoff drought of 15 seasons, the longest in the N.F.L. Since routing the turnover-plagued Jets, 43-23, on Oct. 26, they dropped their last two games, 17-13 to the Kansas City Chiefs and 22-9 at the Miami Dolphins, to slip to 5-5. Marrone and members of his staff used the Internet to provide players with the game plan and with film of the Jets, material that would normally be distributed and reviewed in meetings involving the offense, the defense and special teams. Marrone planned to sleep in his office Wednesday night, as he had the night before. He said it helped from a schematic standpoint that the 2-8 Jets, who are coming off a bye week after ending an eight-game losing streak with a 20-13 victory at home against the Pittsburgh Steelers, are a familiar A.F.C. East opponent his team played recently. But he noted that there was no way to replace lost practices. “We implement these plans and we go forward with them, but during the course of the week, as you practice and see what players are feeling comfortable with, you take some things out and you might want to add some,” he said. “One of the challenges we have now is we have these plans and the players are comfortable with it, we might not be able to practice as much as we wanted, but we’ve got to be able to go out there and execute.” When Jets quarterback Michael Vick was asked about the value of practice, he replied: “I think the most important thing you can do is practice. You have to get a feel for timing, new concepts, new things you may be doing, and I think it is very critical. The last thing you want to do is miss a week of practice and come and try to play. I’m not saying that it can’t be done, but I just know how important it is.”
