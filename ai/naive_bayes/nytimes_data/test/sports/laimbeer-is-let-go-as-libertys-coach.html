The Liberty chose not to renew the contract of their coach and general manager, Bill Laimbeer, the team announced Tuesday. The Liberty were 26-42 in Laimbeer’s two seasons and missed the playoffs both years. He led the Detroit Shock to three W.N.B.A. titles as general manager and coach from 2002 to 2009. ■  ■ Detroit Pistons guard Jodie Meeks is expected to miss about eight weeks with a stress reaction of his lower back. Meeks signed a $19.5 million, three-year deal this off-season. ■ A judge set a March trial date in the lawsuit by Donald Sterling’s estranged wife against his mistress. His wife, Rochelle Sterling, accuses V. Stiviano of befriending wealthy older men and receiving lavish gifts. She is seeking the return of $2.5 million in gifts that included a $1.8 million duplex purchased with money from her husband. The suit says Stiviano also received a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover worth more than $500,000. (AP)
