Italy: Child Thought to Be Rid of H.I.V. Suffers a Relapse
The case resembles another in which aggressive treatment of a baby born with the virus that causes AIDS failed to prevent its resurgence.

A child in Milan treated early and aggressively with AIDS drugs after being born with H.I.V. suffered a rebound of the virus soon after stopping the drugs, according to a new study in The Lancet. Italian doctors had originally hoped the child could survive without drugs, as a baby born in rural Mississippi in 2010 appeared to do for more than a year. But in July, pediatricians announced that the Mississippi baby had relapsed, indicating that early treatment had not wiped out all the reservoirs of virus. The Milan child was 3 years old in late 2012 and had no detectable virus in blood tests when treatment was stopped, but the virus surged after two weeks. The Milan child was more obviously infected than the Mississippi one, said Dr. Sharon Lewin, a prominent Australian AIDS researcher who is familiar with both cases, because he had other infection markers, including H.I.V.-specific white blood cells.
