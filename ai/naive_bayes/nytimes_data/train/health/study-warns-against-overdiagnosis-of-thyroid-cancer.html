Study Warns Against Overdiagnosis of Thyroid Cancer
Experts find that soaring rates of diagnoses in South Korea and elsewhere are due to increased screening and can lead to unnecessary treatment.

To the shock of many  Similar upward trends for thyroid cancer are found in the United States and Europe, although not to the same degree. The thyroid cancer rate in the United States has more than doubled since 1994. Cancer experts agree that the reason for the situation in South Korea and elsewhere is not a real increase in the disease. Instead, it is down to screening, which is finding tiny and harmless tumors that are better left undisturbed, but that are being treated aggressively. South Koreans embraced screening about 15 years ago when the government started a national program for a variety of cancers — breast, cervix, colon, stomach and liver. Doctors and hospitals often included  In the United States and Europe, where there are no formal, widespread screening programs for thyroid cancer, scans for other conditions, like ultrasound exams of the carotid artery in the neck or CT scans of the chest are finding tiny thyroid tumors. Although more and more small thyroid cancers are being found, however, the death rate has remained rock steady, and low. If early detection were saving lives, death rates should have come down. That pattern — more cancers’ being detected and treated but no change in the death rate — tells researchers that many of the cancers they are finding and treating were not dangerous. It is a phenomenon that researchers call overdiagnosis, finding cancers that did not need to be found because they grow very slowly or not at all. Left alone, they would probably never cause problems. Overdiagnosis is difficult to combat. Pathologists cannot tell which small tumors are dangerous, and most people hear the word “cancer” and do not want to take a chance. They want the cancer gone. But cancer experts said the situation in South Korea should be a message to the rest of the world about the serious consequences that large-scale screening of healthy people can have. “It’s a warning to us in the U.S. that we need to be very careful in our advocacy of screening,” said Dr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society. “We need to be very specific about where we have good data that it saves lives.” Colon cancer screening The soaring increase in thyroid cancers in South Korea is documented in  The epidemic was not caused by an environmental toxin or infectious agent, said Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth, an author of the paper. “An epidemic of real disease would be expected to produce a dramatic rise in the number of deaths from disease,” he said. “Instead we see an epidemic of diagnosis, a dramatic rise in diagnosis and no change in death.” Cancer experts stress that some thyroid cancers are deadly — usually they are the larger ones. And, they say, if a person notices symptoms like a lump on the neck or hoarseness, they should not be ignored. “But there is a real difference between not ignoring something obvious and telling the population to try really hard to find something wrong,” Dr. Welch said. Thyroid cancer tends to be particularly indolent. On autopsy, as many as a third of people have tiny thyroid cancers that went undetected in their lifetime. Once a cancer is found, though, treatment is onerous. It involves removing the thyroid. Patients must then take thyroid hormones for the rest of their lives. For some, Dr. Brawley said, the replacement is not completely effective and they end up with chronically low thyroid hormone levels, feeling depressed and sluggish as a result. In a small percentage of those having thyroid surgery, surgeons accidentally damage the nearby vocal cords — that happened to the 2 percent of South Korean patients who ended up with  In South Korea, some alarmed doctors, including Dr. Hyeong Sik Ahn of the College of Medicine at Korea University in Seoul, the first author of the new paper, have called for thyroid cancer screening to be banned. But their calls were mostly ignored, Dr. Ahn explained in an email. “Most thyroid doctors, especially surgeons, deny or minimize harms.” Thyroid experts in the United States are calling for restraint in diagnosing and treating tiny tumors. A few places, like Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, offer patients with small tumors the option of simply waiting and having regular scans to see if the tumor grows. But few patients have joined the program. “Once we have made a diagnosis of cancer it is difficult to say, ‘Don’t do anything,' ” said Dr. Ashok R. Shaha, a thyroid cancer surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering who is concerned about the zeal to diagnose and treat tiny tumors. Doctors as well as patients can be wary, he said. “In the U.S. we have a fear that if we miss a cancer the patient will sue.” Dr. R. Michael Tuttle, who runs the wait-and-see program at Memorial-Sloan Kettering, said the best way to encourage observation of very low-risk thyroid cancer instead of aggressive treatment was to “stop the diagnosis.” That means, he said, “decrease screening and decrease F.N.A.,” meaning fine needle aspiration, which is used to examine thyroid lumps noticed coincidentally. And the lesson from South Korea should be heeded, said Dr. Barnett S. Kramer, director of the division of cancer prevention at the National Cancer Institute. “The message for so long is that early detection is always good for you,” he said. But this stark tale of screening gone wrong “should acutely raise awareness of the consequences of acting on the intuition that all screening must be of benefit and all diagnoses at an early stage are of benefit.”
