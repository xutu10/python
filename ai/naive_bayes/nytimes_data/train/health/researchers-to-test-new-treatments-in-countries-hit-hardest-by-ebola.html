Researchers to Test New Treatments in Countries Hit Hardest by Ebola

Researchers on Wednesday announced that they would soon begin the first clinical trials to test experimental treatments for Ebola in the West African countries most affected by the outbreak. Until now, such treatments have mainly been available to the small number of patients treated in the United States and Europe, not those in the epidemic’s epicenter. “This is an unprecedented international partnership which represents hope for patients to finally get a real treatment against a disease that today kills between 50 and 80 percent of those infected,” Dr. Annick Antierens of the aid group Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. The group said its treatment centers would be the sites of three clinical trials, to be run by European researchers. One study will test the drug Avigan, another will test the drug brincidofovir, and the third will test blood or plasma transfusions from Ebola survivors. The trials could begin in December, with results on whether the treatments work as early as February. Only a few hundred patients will participate in the trials, still a small portion of those infected in an outbreak that has already killed more than 5,000 people. Officials in the United States are also planning at least one clinical trial in Africa that will probably involve more than one drug. An ethical debate has erupted over whether some patients in the studies should be given a placebo to sharpen the comparison with those who get experimental therapies. The three European-run trials will not include control groups that get placebos, with researchers there arguing that it would be unethical to deny people a treatment that could plausibly save their lives. A control group is not needed to tell if a drug is working, they say. “None of us would consent to be randomized in such circumstances,” researchers wrote last month in the Lancet, a medical journal. Included among those who wrote the article was Peter Horby of Oxford University, who will run the brincidofovir trial. They also argue that African patients will be less likely to participate in the trials if there were a chance they could receive a dummy pill. “It is an option that will not be accepted by the local community,” said Dr. Johan van Griensven of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, who will be in charge of the study testing blood and plasma transfusions, which will take place in Conakry, Guinea. The blood or plasma of those who recover from an infection is expected to contain  American officials say that since it is not known if drugs work, patients are not necessarily being deprived if they get a placebo. They say trials with control groups provide clearer answers. Still, federal officials are trying to minimize the number of patients who would get a placebo. There are likely to be practical problems running clinical studies in the midst of an epidemic, with health care systems already breaking down. The public health authorities had previously announced that trials of two experimental Ebola vaccines were expected to begin soon in West Africa.
