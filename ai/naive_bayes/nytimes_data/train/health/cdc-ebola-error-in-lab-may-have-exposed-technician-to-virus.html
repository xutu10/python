A laboratory mistake at the  The error occurred on Monday when a high-security lab at the C.D.C. in Atlanta, working with Ebola virus from the epidemic in West Africa, sent samples that should have been inactivated to another C.D.C. laboratory, which was down the hall. But the lab sent out the wrong samples, ones that had not been inactivated and that may have contained the live virus. The second lab was not equipped to handle the live virus. The technician who worked with the samples wore gloves and a gown, but no mask, and may have been exposed. The error was discovered on Tuesday.

Under  In the June incident, C.D.C. scientists sent anthrax samples, supposedly killed, to laboratories that were not equipped to handle dangerous pathogens. But the bacteria turned out to be live, because a deactivating technique too weak to wipe out anthrax spores had been used. Dozens of employees were offered  The head of the laboratory that shipped the bacteria resigned a few weeks after the mistakes came to light.

He said in an interview in July that he was “stunned and appalled” by the incident. The mistakes led the C.D.C. to appoint a  The special pathogens branch, where the Ebola accident occurred on Monday, soon received permission to start sending out infectious agents again. The accident is being investigated, an agency spokeswoman, Barbara Reynolds, said. “We’ll learn from this mistake as we’ve learned from the others,” she said.
