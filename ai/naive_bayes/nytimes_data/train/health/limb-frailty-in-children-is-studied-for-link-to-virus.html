Limb Frailty in Children Is Studied for Link to Virus
Federal health officials have asked the nation’s physicians to report all cases of children with limb weakness to determine whether there is a link to enterovirus 68, which is sickening thousands.

Driven by a handful of reports of poliolike symptoms in children, federal health officials have asked the nation’s physicians to report cases of children with limb weakness or paralysis along with specific spinal-cord abnormalities on a magnetic resonance imaging test. As a respiratory illness known as enterovirus 68 is sickening thousands of children from coast to coast, officials are trying to figure out if the weakness could be linked to the virus. The emergence of several cases of limb weakness among children in Colorado put doctors on alert in recent months. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory on Friday, and this week, other cases of unexplained muscle weakness or paralysis came to light in Michigan and in Missouri. The C.D.C. is investigating the cases of 10 children hospitalized at Children’s Hospital Colorado with unexplained arm or leg weakness since Aug. 9. Some of the children, who range in age from 1 to 18, also developed symptoms like facial drooping, double vision, or difficulty swallowing or talking. Four of them tested positive for enterovirus 68, also known as enterovirus D68, which has recently caused severe respiratory illness in children in 41 states and the District of Columbia. One tested positive for rhinovirus, which can cause the common cold. Two tested negative. Two patients’ specimens are still being processed; another was never tested. It is unclear whether the muscle weakness is connected to the viral outbreak. “It’s one possibility we are looking at, but certainly not the only possibility,” said Mark Pallansch, director of the C.D.C.’s division of viral diseases. The C.D.C. grew concerned after hearing about a high number of cases of unexplained limb paralysis at the Colorado hospital in a short period. “It would be unusual for a hospital to see a patient like that more than once or twice a year,” Dr. Pallansch said. All of the Colorado patients also had spinal cord lesions evident on an M.R.I. test. On Tuesday, the University of Michigan C. S. Mott Children’s Hospital in Ann Arbor confirmed that four children with varying limb weakness had been seen in its emergency department in the past few weeks. In three cases, “we are concerned it could be related to enterovirus D68, but we don’t have confirmatory testing from the C.D.C. as of yet,” said Dr. Marie Lozon, the hospital’s division director for pediatric emergency medicine. One infant boy with paralysis has confirmed enterovirus D68. But, Dr. Lozon said, “he didn’t come to the hospital for respiratory difficulties, he came to the emergency department because his parents noted he wasn’t using a leg correctly.” In this infant’s case, Dr. Lozon said, “the limb weakness wasn’t just weakness — it was paralysis,” ultimately in both legs. He has since been discharged. Dr. Pallansch from the C.D.C. said any case of limb weakness that met the case definition outlined in Friday’s health advisory should be reported. “Let me be clear: We don’t even require that the child had a previous respiratory illness,” he said. In Kansas City, Mo., Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, the division director of infectious diseases at Children’s Mercy Hospital, said three children developed limb weakness there and had spinal inflammation on M.R.I. tests. “They can’t lift an arm or a leg,” she said, adding, “Even a little baby moves both arms at the same time when excited — but they would move only one arm.” Yet none of the three Missouri patients tested positive for enterovirus 68. “This is a very, very, very rare neurologic manifestation, and we don’t even know it’s connected to enterovirus D68,” Dr. Jackson said. Her hospital is working with the C.D.C. To figure out why children are experiencing limb weakness and who is most at risk, Dr. Pallansch said, the C.D.C. decided to “actively ask the question, ‘Have you seen cases similar to this at your hospital?’ rather than relying on a passive system where we may not hear about them.” Dr. Samuel Dominguez, an epidemiologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, said that his team had ruled out West Nile virus, polio, herpes virus and enterovirus 71, which sometimes causes paralytic disease. Not all cases of limb weakness meet the C.D.C.’s case definition. For example, since Aug. 1, Upstate Golisano Children’s Hospital in Syracuse has had two patients with limb weakness associated with respiratory infection, but neither had spinal lesions on an M.R.I., said Dr. Thomas Welch, the medical director. Health care providers  No deaths have been attributed to enterovirus 68. On Monday, a specimen from a preschooler in New Jersey who died last week was sent to the C.D.C. to determine if he had enterovirus 68, according to a spokeswoman for the State Department of Health.
