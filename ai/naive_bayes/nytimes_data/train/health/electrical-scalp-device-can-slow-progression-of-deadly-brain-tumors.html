Electrical Scalp Device Can Slow Progression of Deadly Brain Tumors
An electrical device glued to the scalp can prolong survival in people with the deadliest type of brain tumor, glioblastoma, researchers have found.

The equipment consists of four pads carrying transducer arrays that patients glue to their scalps and change every few days. Wires lead to a six-pound operating system and power supply. Except for some scalp irritation, the device has no side effects, the study found. But patients have to wear it more or less around the clock and must keep their heads shaved. It generates alternating, low-intensity electrical fields — so-called tumor-treating fields — that can halt tumor growth by stopping cells from dividing, which leads to their death. The researchers said the technology might also help treat other cancers, and would be tested in mesothelioma and cancers of the lung, ovary, breast and pancreas. The equipment is made by  Novocure’s device has been approved in the United States since 2011, but only to treat recurrent glioblastomas, not newly diagnosed ones. It costs $21,000 a month, and some insurers cover it. So far, Novocure has been providing it free to patients without insurance coverage, according to William F. Doyle, the company’s executive chairman. The study tested the device in newly diagnosed cases. The results were to be presented on Saturday in Miami, at a meeting of the Society for Neuro-Oncology, by Dr. Roger Stupp, the study director and chairman of the department of oncology and cancer at the University Hospital of Zurich. The data came from the first 315 patients, who were followed from 18 to 60 months. They were assigned at random to one of two groups: 105 received standard treatment alone, usually consisting of surgery, radiation and the chemotherapy drug temozolomide; the other 210 received standard treatment and the electrical device. Patients who wore the device fared better than those who did not: Their median survival was 19.6 months, compared with 16.6 months in those on standard treatment alone. Among those with the device, 43 percent survived two years, compared with 29 percent among those receiving only standard therapy. “It was a surprise, and better than we would have expected,” Dr. Stupp said in an interview. The study design called for a data analysis partway through to monitor the patients’ safety. When the monitoring board saw how much better patients were doing with the electrical fields, it recommended that the study be stopped so that the device could be offered to everyone. It was the first time that a monitoring board had recommended stopping a brain-cancer study because one treatment was so much better than another. Dr. Patrick Y. Wen, director of neuro-oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who was not involved with the study, said that until now, there had been some skepticism among doctors about the treatment. But “these results seem real,” Dr. Wen said. “With these results, I think more people would definitely use it.” Dana-Farber does not use the device, he said, but with the new data, “I think some patients will probably want to have it, and we will probably plan to use it going forward.” A three-month increase in survival may not sound like much, he said, “but for our patients, it’s not trivial.” Another neuro-oncologist not associated with the study, Dr. Nicholas Butowski of the University of California, San Francisco, described the Novocure device as “polarizing” and said, “Some of my colleagues just do not believe in it.” But Dr. Butowski added: “Perhaps it does work in some patients. It’s got logic behind it.” He said he would use it, though he suspected that the benefit was relatively small. He also described the device as being in its infancy, and said he expected that Novocure would find ways to make it more effective. Maureen Piekanski, 59, a glioblastoma patient and study participant from Throop, Pa., learned about the device from her daughter, a nurse, who had combed the Internet for glioblastoma studies. “It appealed to me because it was noninvasive and it wasn’t going to make me sick,” Ms. Piekanski said. “It was worth a try. I had nothing to lose.” Before making her decision, Ms. Piekanski consulted several doctors, and one told her that she might as well put sewage on her head. She joined the study anyway, because she knew that even with the best available treatment, her outlook was bleak. She said her radiologist had told her, “If you get 15 months, you did good.” She has been wearing the device since August 2011 — more than three years. Her tumor is gone, and the disease has not returned. She has  “I get two months at a time, always thinking I might have a recurrence,” she said. There is no way to tell whether the device has been keeping her alive, or whether she would have done just as well without it. But when she completed the period she had signed up for in the study, and the researchers told her that she could stop wearing the device if she wanted to, she said, “Oh, yeah, I’m keeping it.”
