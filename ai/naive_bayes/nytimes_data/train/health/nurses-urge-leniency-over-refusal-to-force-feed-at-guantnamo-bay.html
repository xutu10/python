Nurses Urge Leniency Over Refusal to Force-Feed at Guantánamo Bay
The case is the latest flash point in an increasingly heated debate over military medical professionals’ role in interrogation and torture.

The case of a Navy medical officer who refused to force-feed prisoners on a hunger strike at  The officer is a nurse and 18-year Navy veteran whose commander has called for an internal inquiry into the refusal, his lawyer said. The case, which came to light in July when a hunger striker called the London-based legal defense group  In letters to Defense Secretary  “His commander has recommended that the case be brought before a formal Board of Inquiry, and that request is making its way up the chain of command,” said Ronald Meister, the nurse’s lawyer. If the board does take up the case, it has the authority to retain the nurse or discharge him, either honorably or dishonorably, Mr. Meister said. “The military pensions don’t vest until 20 years of service, so depending on what happens, he could end up with nothing,” he added. Neither Mr. Meister nor the nurses association offered details about the man’s identity, other than to say that he serves on a base in New England and spent much of his career working on submarines. The military’s aggressive interrogation policy, at Guantánamo and elsewhere, has forced agonizing decisions on medical professionals. Psychologists have helped design the torturous techniques, which have included sleep deprivation and isolation; they have also monitored the interrogations. Medical doctors have advised on caring for the detainees. Details of these professionals’ roles have fueled debates within major medical associations; such debates have played a role in elections in at least one major group, the  One of the main issues is whether the medical associations should discipline members who have taken part in interrogations in any way, even as observers. The Navy case represents the flip side of the equation. It is the first known defiance of Guantánamo’s force-feeding procedure, and the nurses association is acting to defend, rather than to condemn, the medical officer’s actions. Human rights groups have also joined in defending the nurse’s actions based on ethical guidelines. The Navy on Wednesday acknowledged receipt of the letter from the nurses association but did not provide more detail. “Due to the statutory limitations of the Privacy Act of 1974, I am unable to comment on the specifics of this case,” Rear Adm. Rebecca McCormick-Boyle, director of the Navy Nurse Corps, said in a statement. “However, I can assure you that I am monitoring the situation closely.”
