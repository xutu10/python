NATO to Create Interim Rapid Response Force to Counter Russia
The alliance will start the unit, to be made up initially of about 4,000 German, Dutch and Norweigian soldiers, next year mainly to repel potential attacks by Russia.

BRUSSELS  —  The “interim spearhead force” will be made up of German, Dutch and Norwegian troops and is expected to be about the size of a brigade, or about 4,000 troops. The new force responds to a proposal  Because of formidable operational and financial challenges, a permanent quick reaction force will not be established until 2016, the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Tuesday during meetings here of the alliance’s foreign ministers. “NATO hasn’t done this for two decades,” Douglas Lute, the United States ambassador to NATO, said on Monday. “What NATO faced in the last two decades was a different challenge. It faced a challenge on a very sort of deliberate, predictable calendar basis.” “So you didn’t go to the Balkans on NATO rotation by surprise,” Ambassador Lute added. “Nations could take their time preparing the troops, deploy them, then recover them and replace them.” In contrast, the new interim spearhead force is supposed to be prepared to rush to the defense of the alliance’s Baltic and Central European members in a matter of days. A senior NATO official, who declined to be identified because he was discussing internal planning, said that the interim force would be established by Jan. 1. It has not yet been decided whether the units that are to make up the force would be based in their home countries or kept at another location, the NATO official said. But the readiness of the force would be raised so that an entire brigade of troops could be deployed within a few days. NATO officials, he said, are still discussing whether some lead elements of the brigade should be able to deploy more quickly. The idea is that the quick response mission should be rotated among NATO nations. Individual nations will assume the additional cost of keeping the troops assigned to the force at a high level of preparedness. But there is discussion within NATO about establishing some sort of common fund to defray the cost. President Vladmir V. Putin’s penchant for calling snap “exercises” and moving large numbers of Russian ground forces has made it vital for NATO to have a faster way to respond, the NATO official said.  Many government and military officials whose countries form NATO’s eastern flank — particularly Poland and the Baltic States — had been hoping for more out of the alliance’s September summit meeting than the creation of a rapid reaction force, such as the permanent positioning of NATO troops in the region. “We hoped, though, that even a decision this modest will mark the beginning of a new trend in the strategic thinking of the alliance, where the eastern flank has been neglected for many years,” said Marcin Zaborowski, director of the Polish Institute of International Affairs. Unwilling to wait for NATO to act, Lithuania decided to forge ahead and create its own 2,500-member rapid reaction force — it became active on Nov. 1 — that would try to hold off any outside incursion until NATO troops could mobilize and get there. While not criticizing NATO openly, many political leaders in the region worried about the lack of visible progress in getting the force up and running in the months immediately after the Wales summit. “The message the delay was sending was that there was a lack of political will in NATO to follow up on the decision, and the Russians took the message that the proposal wasn’t very serious,” Mr. Zaborowski said. The alliance also agreed to continue a program of modest troop rotations and exercises on the territory of its Central European members through 2015, another signal that the alliance stands ready to deter a Russian attack. A senior State Department official who is traveling with Secretary of State John Kerry said that Russia was not only continuing to supply Ukrainian separatists with weapons but also still had forces inside Ukraine. “The Ukrainian estimate of the number of Russians destabilizing Eastern Ukraine and other parts of the country is in the thousands,” the officials said. “We certainly believe that there are any number of hundreds of Russians still inside Ukraine.” Tensions in Ukraine were lowered on Tuesday when the government and one of two Russian-backed rebel groups fighting in eastern Ukraine pledged to recommit to a cease-fire along one portion of the front. Under the agreement announced by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Ukrainian military and Luhansk People’s Republic will order a cease-fire along the front starting Friday, and then pull heavy weaponry from a buffer zone starting Saturday. The Ukrainian government has said parallel talks with the other main rebel group, the Donetsk People’s Republic, halted artillery fire in a battle for the Donetsk airport for part of the day on Tuesday, though shelling resumed in the evening. A rebel leader, Andrei Purgin, told Russia’s RIA news agency that his group hoped the sides would withdraw heavy weaponry from near the airport on Dec. 10. The monitoring group has negotiated similar “quiet periods” along sections of the front before, only to watch them collapse into renewed violence. After a videoconference Tuesday morning with Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine’s foreign minister, the foreign ministers issued a statement expressing political support for Ukraine and some further aid, but no member of the alliance has offered to provide to provide lethal weapons to help Ukraine’s beleaguered armed forces. Russia has also been carrying out what NATO says has been an aggressive series of air exercises, includes instances in which Russian warplanes have declined to file flight plans or talk to civilian air controllers, or have turned off their transponders. NATO aircraft routinely intercept Russian aircraft that approach Western territory, and Mr. Stoltenberg said that the number of intercepts was more than 50 percent higher than last year.
