WASHINGTON —  American allies in the campaign against the Sunni extremist group that calls itself the Islamic State have agreed to send 1,500 troops to join American soldiers and military personnel who are advising and training Iraqi and Kurdish troops, American military officials said on Monday.   When combined with the 3,000 troops the United States has committed to send to  United States officials declined to say which countries had committed the additional troops, saying that they wanted those announcements to come out of individual capitals. So far, the United States has been joined by Britain, France and the United Arab Emirates, among other countries, in the war to push the Sunni militancy out of Iraq.  The additional trainers and advisers are to help Iraqis and Kurds as they plan a major offensive expected next spring against Islamic State fighters who have poured into Iraq from Syria. Military advisers will establish training sites across Iraq; a number of them, officials said, would deploy specifically to Anbar Province, the Sunni stronghold in western Iraq that was the scene of bloody fighting for years after the 2003 American-led invasion.  Administration officials said the expanded effort was intended to help the Iraqis break the Islamic State’s occupation in northern and western Iraq, re-establish the government’s control over the country’s major roads and borders, and retake Mosul, a city of about a million people 250 miles north of Baghdad.  President Obama has repeatedly ruled out sending American ground troops to Iraq, and has, thus far, characterized the troops being sent as trainers and advisers, saying that they will have no combat role. But military officials warn that when the battle for Mosul and other urban areas starts, American JTAC teams — for Joint Terminal Attack Controllers — would likely be needed to direct combat aircraft and other offensive operations from positions very close to the fighting.
