JAKARTA — Rescue teams in  More than 30 homes were buried or swept away on Friday by the landslide, which was caused by heavy seasonal rains in the province’s Banjarnegara District, according to Syamsul Maarif, head of the National Board for Disaster Management. Mr. Syamsul said that 91 people remained missing as of Saturday afternoon after the landslide southeast of Jakarta, the capital. “In total, 11 people suffered severe injuries and were transferred to the hospital in Banjarnegara,” he said in a text message to reporters. Indonesian army soldiers joined the search-and-rescue teams, local health department staff and civilian volunteers to scour the site of the landslide, using everything from shovels to heavy equipment to find any survivors, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster management board. Local television footage showed workers removing victims wrapped in orange body bags from the disaster site, which was strewn with thick mud and debris. Heavy rains in the area forced the teams to halt their search temporarily on Saturday evening, according to local television reports. Residents reported that a cliff on a hillside in a residential area of Sampang village collapsed during a rainstorm around 5:30 p.m., cutting off electricity and sending the darkened hamlet into a panic. “I was washing my car and suddenly the cliff collapsed into a landslide,” a local resident identified as Giman told  The landslide on Friday was the second in several days on the densely populated Java Island. Mud and rocks also hit Central Java’s Wonosobo District on Thursday, killing at least one villager, The Associated Press reported.
