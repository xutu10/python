A Bahraini court sentenced the democracy advocate Zainab al-Khawaja to three years in prison and fined her almost $8,000 on Thursday for insulting the king by tearing up his photograph, her lawyer and a human rights group said. Bahrain has been in turmoil since protests erupted in Manama, the capital, inspired by the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. Ms. Khawaja is free on bail, and her sentence was suspended pending an appeal, her lawyer, Mohammed al-Wasati, said. She is the daughter of the jailed activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja.
