The police filed a murder complaint against an American Marine on Wednesday, accusing him of killing a transgender Filipino whom he met at a bar. Police Chief Inspector Gil Domingo said the Marine, Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton, was the last person seen with the victim late Saturday when they checked into a motel. The victim, Jennifer Laude, whose former name was Jeffrey, was found with her head resting on the room’s toilet, apparently having been drowned, Mr. Domingo said. The criminal complaint was filed with prosecutors, who will decide on formal charges. Private Pemberton was being held on the American amphibious assault ship Peleliu, in the Subic Bay free port northwest of Manila, military officials said. The case could test ties between the two countries, which signed an accord in April that allows greater access by the United States military to Philippine military camps.
