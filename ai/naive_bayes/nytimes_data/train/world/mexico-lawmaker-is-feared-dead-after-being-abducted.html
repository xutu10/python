Two charred bodies were discovered Tuesday inside a burned-out vehicle in which a congressman and his driver were kidnapped at gunpoint the previous day, the Mexican authorities said. The Zacatecas State prosecutor, Arturo Nahle, said that although the sport utility vehicle was completely burned, the license plates left “no doubt” that it was that of Gabriel Gómez Michel, a lawmaker with the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party. Mr. Nahle said DNA testing was being done on the two bodies. Two emergency phone calls on Monday informed the authorities that armed men in several vehicles had intercepted a blue Chevrolet Suburban on a highway on the outskirts of Guadalajara, the capital of the western state of Jalisco, he said. Security cameras backed that up. Mr. Nahle said other legislators who were questioned had no knowledge of any threat against Mr. Gómez Michel, 49, a pediatrician, sugarcane producer and former mayor who became a congressman in 2012.
