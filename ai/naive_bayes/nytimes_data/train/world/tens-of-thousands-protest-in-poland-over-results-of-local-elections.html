Tens of Thousands Protest in Poland Over Results of Local Elections
The leader of Poland’s largest opposition party claimed that the results of last month’s municipal elections had been falsified.

WARSAW — Tens of thousands of people gathered in Warsaw on Saturday as the leader of  The party, the conservative Law and Justice, received the most votes but got fewer seats in local assemblies than the governing Civic Platform Party because of the apportioning system. The Law and Justice leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, pointed to the high number of invalid ballot papers and discrepancies between the official results and an exit poll that showed Law and Justice with a big lead. Mr. Kaczynski, a former prime minister, demanded that the elections be held again, which President Bronislaw Komorowski called “madness.” A hardware malfunction forced a count by hand and a long delay in the announcement of the results. The official results showed that for the first time in nine years, Mr. Kaczynski’s party had received the most votes, though by a narrow margin, winning about 26.8 percent, compared with about 26.4 percent for Civic Platform. But under the complicated voting system, Law and Justice was awarded 171 regional seats, compared with Civic Platform’s 179. “This campaign against us can be described in only one word: disgrace!” Mr. Kaczynski told his supporters during the Saturday demonstration, which was organized on the anniversary of the imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981. His party’s symbolic victory over Civic Platform, which has recently been weakened by the departure of its charismatic leader, Donald Tusk,  Kazimierz Kik, a political scientist at Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, said that Mr. Kaczynski seemed to have realized that the only way he could win next year was to convince millions of “economically and socially disadvantaged” Poles that the current government is becoming increasingly authoritarian. But, Mr. Kik said, it may work “because so many people mistrust those in power.”
