Netanyahu Seeks to Reassure Jordan on Holy Site
The Israeli prime minister called King Abdullah II of Jordan, who withdrew his ambassador, to reassure him that Israel would maintain the status quo at the site.

JERUSALEM — Prime Minister  The phone call came a day after Jordan recalled its ambassador from Israel, saying the move was for consultations and to protest Israeli “violations” at the site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. Some nationalist Israelis have been challenging a decades-old ban on Jewish prayer at the site, revered by Jews as the place where ancient temples once stood, and by Muslims as the site of Al Aqsa Mosque and the golden Dome of the Rock. Jordan is the official custodian of the compound; Israel is in charge of security. Demonstrative visits by Israeli activists and politicians pushing for Jewish prayer rights, increasingly fierce clashes between  Mr. Netanyahu said he told King Abdullah that Israel was committed to maintaining Jordan’s traditional role at the site, adding: “We have to make every effort to restore calm, quiet and security. But I think we have to make that effort throughout the world.” A spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu, Mark Regev, said in an earlier statement that those pushing for a change in the status quo at the site — including lawmakers from Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud Party and ministers from the governing coalition — presented “a personal view and not the policy of the government.” The Jordanian news agency, Petra, reported that during the call King Abdullah emphasized Jordan’s absolute rejection of any provocations or steps Israel might take to change the arrangements in the compound. There was no word from either side about if or when the ambassador might return. Also Thursday, for the first time in seven years, Israel allowed the export of agricultural produce from Gaza to the West Bank, easing a blockade. The move was meant to encourage economic growth in the aftermath of last summer’s 50-day war in the Palestinian coastal territory, which is dominated by Hamas, the Islamic militant group. Israeli and Palestinian officials said Thursday’s transfer included 10 tons of cucumbers. Gisha, an Israeli group that advocates free movement for Gazans, welcomed the step and called for the export of manufactured items, saying access to markets in Israel and the West Bank is “critical to rehabilitating Gaza’s agricultural and industrial sectors.” The Israeli military said one ton of fish would be transferred on Sunday.
