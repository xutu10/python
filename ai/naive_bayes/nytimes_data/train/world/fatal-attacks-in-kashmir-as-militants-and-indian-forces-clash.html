NEW DELHI — Clashes between militants and Indian forces left 20 people dead in the Indian-administered valley of  In the worst attack, heavily armed militants penetrated an Indian Army camp, setting off a gun battle that left 11 members of the security forces and six militants dead, the army said. Two other militants were killed in Srinagar, Kashmir’s summer capital, and in a third episode, a civilian was killed by a grenade thrown at a bus stop. The army identified the attackers as foreigners, presumably from Pakistan. Indian officials said they believed that the attacks were meant to disrupt voting in elections in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is to hold a third round of voting on Tuesday. Turnout so far has exceeded 70 percent, showing that most voters are ignoring calls by Kashmiri separatist leaders to boycott the elections. The results are to be announced Dec. 23. “It is a clear attempt to intimidate the voters, and militants are coming from across the Line of Control,” G. Parthasarathy, India’s former ambassador to Pakistan, said in a telephone interview, referring to the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Mr. Modi condemned the attacks, calling them “desperate attempts to derail the atmosphere of hope and good will, as seen by increased voter turnout.” The attack on the huge, heavily guarded army camp, in Mohura, lasted more than six hours. Indian news channels showed footage of troops firing furiously as armored vehicles slowly patrolled the camp, throwing grenades into bunkers raided by fighters. The authorities said the militants were prepared for an extended battle, carrying 32 unused grenades, six Kalashnikov rifles and 55 magazines with ammunition, as well as radio sets, medical supplies, GPS devices and food. On Monday, Mr. Modi is scheduled to appear in Srinagar, where the police said they killed two other armed militants. It was not clear who was behind the grenade attack at the bus stop, in the town of Tral, which also wounded several people. After initial overtures to Pakistan, Mr. Modi has taken a tough line. Most significantly, he suspended  The decision still stings in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. Answering questions from reporters on Thursday, a spokeswoman for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that “the dialogue was scheduled and dates were fixed.” “India canceled the visit without any solid reason,” said the spokeswoman, Tasnim Aslam Khan. “We believe the onus is on India to take the initiative.” Pakistani fighters believe that Kashmiris should be allowed to vote in a referendum on independence from India. Hafiz Saeed, the founder of the banned militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, is reported to have told a crowd in Lahore, Pakistan, on Thursday, “The elections in Kashmir cannot be a substitute for a referendum.”
