A man accused of holding three women against their will in a London house for 30 years has been charged with 25 offenses, the police said Thursday. The police said the man, Aravindan Balakrishnan, 74, was charged with false imprisonment, rape, cruelty and indecent assault. The charges, spanning from 1980 to 2013, relate to three women who were freed from a London house last year after decades of what was said to be “emotional control” and domestic servitude. Mr. Balakrishnan was arrested in November 2013.
