The United States imposed sanctions on Monday on four more Russians tied to allegations of human rights abuses. Two officials — Deputy Prosecutor General Victor Grin and Andrei Strizhov, an investigator — were said to be involved in the cover-up of the death of Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in prison after exposing large-scale corruption, a senior State Department official said. Visa bans and asset freezes were also imposed on two senior officials of the Chechen Republic implicated in the kidnapping and torture of a Chechen activist, Ruslan Kutayev. The Treasury Department identified the Chechen officials as Apti Alaudinov, deputy minister of internal affairs, and Magomed Daudov, chief of staff of the executive office.
