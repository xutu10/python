Immigration Is a Hot Issue in Britain as Elections Approach
Britain's efforts to restrict immigration have become a hot issue as elections approach.

LONDON —  John O’Keefe, a neuroscientist at University College, London, brought pride to  Britain’s efforts to restrict immigration have become “a very, very large obstacle” to hiring the best scientists, he said. “We should be thinking hard about making Britain a more welcoming place.” That is precisely the opposite of the current mood in Britain, seven months before an election, where immigration, the economy and the health service are the hottest issues. Before the elections in 2010,  But there is a long and awkward way to go. While the government has set targets, it has little control over the variables. In the year ended March 2014, the government reports, 265,000 non-European Union citizens moved to Britain, ending a steady decline since the recent peak of 334,000 in 2011. Net immigration to Britain from the European Union rose to 130,000 in the year through March, up from 75,000 two years ago. Total net immigration in the year through March was 243,000. That is back up to the 10-year average of nearly a quarter of a million people, said Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch UK, which advocates restrictions. “If allowed to continue,” he said, the population will increase by 12 million — two more Scotlands — in 20 years. “That’s huge,” he said, arguing that three-quarters of British voters “want to see it reduced.” So immigration is a fertile topic for the right and for the nationalist UK Independence Party, which is squeezing Mr. Cameron, and it is so sensitive with voters that even the opposition Labour Party has little to say about it. Britain is an attractive place to live and find work, said Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Not only that, his colleague Heather Rolfe points out, Britain benefits in the long run from immigrants, who provide flexibility for employers and pay more in taxes than they take from public funds. Even Philip Hammond, the Conservative foreign secretary, was slightly abashed on the subject at the party conference last week. Britain should be proud of being so attractive, he conceded. “But we are answerable to an electorate which is uncomfortable with destabilizing mass immigration.” Setting a target was a bad idea, Mr. Portes said, since no country can control immigration and Britain cannot now control immigration from the European Union. “And then the British labor market has performed very well” to create jobs, unlike in Continental Europe, “so the goal turned from almost impossible to impossible.” At the party conference, Mr. Cameron vowed to negotiate limits on European migration, saying that he “would not take ‘no’ for an answer.” But as Mr. Green pointed out, “He didn’t say what the question was.” After meeting Mr. Cameron in London this week, Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France said that freedom of movement and labor were treaty commitments, and that the European Union had other priorities, like growth and jobs. It might be possible for Mr. Cameron to get a deal limiting migration from any new members, but there are none on the horizon. And he could get some limits on “benefits tourism,” since British welfare benefits are comparatively good. “But there’s not a lot of it,” Mr. Portes said. “It’s basically a myth, and shutting it down won’t save much money or stop many from coming.” What would help Mr. Cameron is to change the rules for existing members, but as Mr. Valls pointed out, that is “unrealistic” and would be opposed by many. The other option, of course, is the nuclear one favored by the Independence Party and about 100 of Mr. Cameron’s own members of Parliament: to leave the European Union altogether.
