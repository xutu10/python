Members of an Ontario family lived with a corpse in a bedroom for six months because they believed the dead man would be resurrected if they prayed. The body was discovered in September 2013 when the family was evicted for not paying the mortgage. Peter Wald, 52, died in March 2013 of what the authorities believe were natural causes linked to diabetes, a defense lawyer, Peter Boushy, said. Kaling Wald, 50, pleaded guilty to failing to notify the police that her husband had died, and was sentenced Monday to probation and counseling, Mr. Boushy said Tuesday. Ms. Wald had left the body in a bed and sealed up the bedroom in the Hamilton, Ontario, home where the two lived with their six children and other adults. “There clearly was an overexuberance of one’s faith,” Mr. Boushy said.
