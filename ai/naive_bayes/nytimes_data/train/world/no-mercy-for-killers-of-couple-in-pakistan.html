‘No Mercy’ for Killers of Couple in Pakistan

LAHORE, Pakistan —  Prime Minister  Mr. Sharif, through a spokesman, called the murders “an unacceptable crime” and said that the “state must act proactively to protect its minorities from violence and injustice.” Hundreds of people, enraged over the blasphemy accusation, descended on the couple, Shahzad and Shama Masih, on Tuesday in Chak 59, a small village in Punjab Province. The couple, who had three children and were believed to be in their mid-20s, both worked as laborers at the kiln. Police officials said that 39 out of the nearly 50 people who had been arrested in the case were brought before an antiterrorism court Wednesday, and permission was sought from the court to interrogate them. Those arrested included Yousaf Gujjar, the owner of the kiln, and the clerics of several mosques, who are accused of urging their followers to seek revenge after it was reported that a Quran had been burned in the kiln. “Their incitement is publicly known,” said Jawad Qamar, the local police chief. “Everybody saw how a charged mob of more than a 1,000 came on trolleys and tortured and burned the couple to death.” The killings were met with widespread condemnation in the country as protests were held Wednesday in the provincial capital, Lahore, and Islamabad, the capital. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, a private group, urged the authorities to bring the killers to justice. The group said that its fact-finding team did not find any evidence of Quran desecration at the site. Instead, the commission said, it appeared that Mr. Masih had had a dispute over wages or advance money with Mr. Gujjar. Though the police have not provided a motive, blasphemy allegations are often used to settle personal scores and vendettas, rights groups say. In recent years, allegations of blasphemy, which is a crime punishable by death or life in prison, have led to instances of violence and vigilante justice.
