Echoes of Patty Hearst in Islamic State ‘Report’ From Kobani Anchored by Hostage
Narration by the British hostage John Cantlie on Islamic State propaganda videos is reminiscent of recordings by the kidnapped Patty Hearst.

A propaganda video  What made that decision particularly difficult was that the militants’ video was produced in the form of  Standing on a rooftop near the Turkish border during a lull in the fighting, Mr. Cantlie, a captive photojournalist, presents a diatribe against fellow journalists, claiming that specific Western news media accounts of the battle for Kobani were inaccurate. In a particularly perverse passage, he tells viewers that despite what they might have heard about the success of the Kurdish defenders of the town, backed by international airstrikes, the only fighters he has seen in the city are Islamic State militants. Despite the obvious news value of seeing Kobani from behind Islamist lines, many journalists instinctively recoiled from the prospect of following the instructions of the militants by downloading the full video report from the Internet and broadcasting it, either on the air or online. It is a dilemma that in many ways echoes that faced by American broadcasters 40 years ago, when militants calling themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army  Given that Mr. Cantlie, who has been held hostage since 2012, is under obvious duress, some of his colleagues suggested that it would be more appropriate to deny his kidnappers the oxygen of publicity, by pressing to have the video removed from the Internet, than to show any part of the faux news report to viewers. (Within 24 hours, many copies of the video were indeed removed from YouTube.) Other journalists argued that it was unfair to Mr. Cantlie to describe his participation in the video as “reporting.” Although a minority of voices on social networks have accused Mr. Cantlie of treason for arguing the militants’ case, and one British official  While Mr. Cantlie’s state of mind can only be guessed at, in  “I’ve had to watch as James, Steven Sotloff, David Haines and Alan Henning walked out of the door,” the militant publication quotes Mr. Cantlie as saying, “one every two weeks since Aug. 18, never to return, knowing they were going to their deaths. What does that do to a man?” Given that, his situation seems far closer to what Ms. Hearst endured than to, say, that of Ezra Pound, the American poet who volunteered to write and present  After weeks of coverage of the struggle for Kobani dominated by dramatic video of airstrikes hitting Islamist positions, seen from nearby hilltops in Turkey, the militants’ video was striking in large part because of how quiet the city seemed. That made some viewers wonder if the footage of Mr. Cantlie might have been manipulated, or even created digitally out of whole cloth. However, Harald Doornbos, a Dutch reporter who has been observing the battle for Kobani from across the Turkish border, confirmed that there were lulls in the fighting. Other close observers noted that one Kobani landmark visible in the Islamic State’s footage, a silver silo bearing a Turkish flag, could be clearly seen from Turkey. That there are spells of eerie quiet in the town was also confirmed by video posted on YouTube this week by Kurdish activists and footage recorded by a local journalist obtained by Al Aan, a Dubai television channel. A distinctive water tower seen in the Islamic State report at one stage also looks very similar to one seen in video of Kobani recorded just before the fighting started that was provided to The Guardian by a resident who escaped across the border to Turkey.
