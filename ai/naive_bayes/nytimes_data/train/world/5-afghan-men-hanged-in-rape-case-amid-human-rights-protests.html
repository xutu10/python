5 Afghan Men Hanged in Rape Case Amid Human Rights Protests

KABUL, Afghanistan —  The hangings, which took place in Pul-e-Charki prison outside Kabul, took place 10 days after the inauguration of Mr. Ghani, who came to power amid promises of sweeping reforms and resetting relations with the West. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad Zeid al-Hussein, appealed to Mr. Ghani last week to halt the executions and called for a judicial review, citing “grave concerns” over a legal process that “failed to comply with national and international fair trial standards.” The trial of the five men, which concluded in early September, lasted just a few hours; human rights groups have alleged that their confessions were obtained using torture. Mr. Ghani inherited the execution order from his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, who signed it on Sept. 27, the day before he left office. On Wednesday Mr. Ghani appeared to bow to domestic pressure over a case that had caused widespread outrage in the country. In late August a group of men, some wearing police uniforms, stopped an Afghan family’s car as it traveled through Paghman, an area on the edge of Kabul with a reputation for criminal activity. The gunmen sexually assaulted four women, one of whom was pregnant. They tied up male relatives in an area within earshot of the assault. Public protests erupted outside the courthouse where seven men were put on trial less than two weeks later. Mr. Karzai publicly called for them to be executed even before the hearing had concluded. Journalists were allowed to watch as the rape victims were ask to identify their attackers a police lineup. In some cases, the women identified the wrong men on their first attempt. During a short appeals process, the men testified that their confessions had been obtained through extensive torture at the hands of the police. Defense lawyers complained of death threats; one quit halfway through the proceedings. Two of the seven men, who said they had no link to the crime, had their sentences reduced to 20 years imprisonment. The police say they are still searching for another three suspects. The contentious trial highlighted the poor state of Afghanistan’s criminal justice system, despite 13 years of expensive efforts by Western allies to reform it. “In allowing the executions to go forward,” said Patricia Gossman, an Afghanistan expert at Human Rights Watch, Mr. Ghani “signaled support not for reform and the rule of law but for business as usual in the courts.” The Western criticism marked a sharp change of tone from Mr. Ghani’s first week in power, when he issued several orders that pleased allies — signing a security pact with the United States, and ordering action in the $900 million Kabul Bank fraud case, which had angered donors. A spokesman for Mr. Ghani’s office declined to comment on the hangings. But the Ministry of Women’s Affairs described them as “a step toward strengthening social justice, defense of women’s rights and a historic lesson to those who might resort to such crimes.” In a statement, the ministry called on the Afghan security forces to find the other three suspects in the case and to “give them their punishment based on the laws.” Also on Wednesday, a Taliban suicide bomber killed five people and wounded 19 in southern Helmand Province, said Sediq Sediqqi, an Interior Ministry spokesman. The attack in the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, was apparently directed at a former district police chief. Heavy fighting has raged around the town of Sangin, in northern Helmand Province, in recent months, while Lashkar Gah has suffered sporadic insurgent attacks.
