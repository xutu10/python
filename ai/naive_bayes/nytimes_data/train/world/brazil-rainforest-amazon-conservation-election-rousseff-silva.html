Clashing Visions of Conservation Shake Brazil’s Presidential Vote 
Satellite data shows that Brazil’s annual deforestation rate in the Amazon is rising again after years of declines, leaving Brazil’s president vulnerable to attacks ahead of Sunday’s election.

NOVO PROGRESSO, Brazil —  As the fires rage, the helicopters of the environmental police at this outpost in the Brazilian Amazon cannot even take off some mornings because the sky is so thick with smoke. The  From the  “The mantra in Brasília is that they have deforestation under control, but the evidence on the ground shows this is not true,” said Philip M. Fearnside, a prominent researcher at the  Beyond alarming scientists, who note the importance of the vast rain forest to the world’s climate and biodiversity, the sparring over the Amazon symbolizes clashing visions of Brazil’s future. Both Ms. Rousseff and her top rival,  Ms. Silva — the daughter of rubber tappers, raised in the far reaches of the rain forest — wants to shift toward energy sources viewed as having less of an impact on the environment. With the Amazon gaining importance as a strategic pillar of Brazil’s economy — which is the largest in Latin America — the jump in deforestation has each candidate lashing out at the other. Ms. Rousseff is heralding what she calls her achievements in the Amazon, like building  “I want to know where the setbacks have been,” Ms. Rousseff said in one caustic remark directed at Ms. Silva in their exchanges over deforestation. Ms. Silva, a former environment minister, contends that Ms. Rousseff’s policies are responsible for the increase in deforestation and an erosion of Brazil’s international standing on environmental issues, pointing to the stalled creation of new conservation areas and Brazil’s refusal to sign a United Nations declaration  “Deforestation is rising again because of incompetence, inefficiency and a lack of commitment in protecting the Amazon,” said Ms. Silva. After surging in the opinion polls in September, she has tried to dispel criticism over policies that some voters see as threatening to large-scale agriculture in the Amazon and other regions. The challenges of balancing conservation and economic development in the world’s largest remaining area of tropical forest come into sharp relief here in the turbulent region around Novo Progresso, a remote settlement of gold miners, cattle ranchers and loggers on the BR-163, a highway cutting across the Amazon. Before Ms. Silva broke from the governing Workers Party in 2009, she oversaw a plan to bolster conservation along the road, which runs more than 1,000 miles and connects the agricultural heartland of Mato Grosso to the port of Santarém. Under the project, the road was to be paved, easing the way for commodities like soybeans to be exported to China. Both forest protection and the asphalting of the highway remain elusive goals. In Pará, a state almost twice the size of Texas, long stretches are still unpaved, producing a bone-rattling ride. When it rains, the BR-163 loses much of its resemblance to a road. Stalled trucks spin their wheels in the mud. Pickups try to avoid careering into potholes the size of kiddie pools. At some points, drivers simply arrange their vehicles in a remarkably orderly line and wait for the mud to dry, a process that can last a day or more. “This place is like a little bit of hell,” said Eduardo Pimentel, 43, a truck driver. Around Novo Progresso, a cat-and-mouse game also plays out each day between land speculators and the environmental police, who fan out by helicopter over colossal stretches of public land to detect signs of fires and illegal logging, gold prospecting and cattle ranching. The crackdown by armed agents of Brazil’s environmental protection agency, who have received so many threats here that they require the protection of other elite police units, is part of Brazil’s efforts to assert control over this disorderly frontier and combat illegal deforestation, a  The stakes are huge. Agriculture continues to expand in the Amazon, while authorities are pursuing a new array of huge dams, raising tension across the immense hinterland. When the security forces here find new signs of illegal deforestation, they often act swiftly, arresting and fining those responsible. They destroy encampments and equipment, setting fire to tractors and logging trucks. Such methods helped lower annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by about 70 percent since 2000. But land speculators are adapting. Investigators say that some have assembled a web of informants tracking the movements of the environmental police. At times, small revolts have also erupted, as when dozens of people in a nearby settlement  Then there are tactics like deploying arsonist crews at times of heavy cloud cover or light rains, when detecting fires under the forest canopy by satellite is thought to be harder. Some have even set the forest alight by tossing Molotov cocktails from small planes, said Luciano de Meneses Evaristo, a top official at Brazil’s environmental protection agency. “This is the Wild West of environmental crimes,” he said. “We are waging an endless war.” Still, Mr. de Meneses Evaristo and other Brazilian officials say that measures taken over the last decade, like creating new national forests and blocking public loans to landowners who violate environmental regulations, have helped push the deforestation rate to historic lows, despite the recent increase. “No country has done more than Brazil to fight illegal deforestation,” said Izabella Teixeira, Brazil’s environment minister, pointing out that Brazilian law allows for certain amounts of legal deforestation, preventing the country from signing the United Nations agreement seeking to end deforestation. Though almost 20 percent of the Brazilian Amazon has been cleared since the 1960s and ’70s, Ms. Teixeira said that Brazil could serve as an anti-deforestation example for the developing world. “I would love for the forests of Indonesia or the Congo River Basin to have the same levels of protection we have forged,” she added. Still, Brazil’s deforestation rate could climb for a second consecutive year, after the 29 percent increase from 2012 to 2013. Preliminary data from a satellite-based system showed a 9 percent increase in  Views differ on whether the alerts reflect another expansion of illegal deforestation, the legal burning of forest on private lands or fires set on previously cleared cattle pastures. Ms. Teixeira said she expected the overall deforestation rate to remain flat in 2014. Others disagree. Adalberto Veríssimo, a researcher at  “We’re witnessing an increase in speculative deforestation and forest destruction for the government’s own infrastructure projects,” Mr. Veríssimo said. “There’s been a rearrangement of priorities, with the Amazon targeted for massive investments. Naturally this opens the way for new deforestation.” Here in Pará, a plan to build a complex of new dams around a tributary of the Amazon River is projected to increase forest loss. New roads are also expected to lure thousands of settlers, pressuring forest resources. Along the BR-163, violent land-grabs persist as speculators eye tracts for grazing cattle and logging. Near the town of Trairão, Osvalinda Marcelino Alves Pereira, 45, recently registered death threats from loggers who accused her of being an informant for the environmental police. “They told me I’d be killed like Dorothy,” said Ms. Alves Pereira, a settler who grows crops like manioc, referring to Dorothy Stang, the American nun and rain forest activist who was  In the deforestation hot spot of Novo Progresso, residents openly chafe at the environmental police and other federal officials. “Global warming is a lie concocted by interests in rich countries which covet Amazonia,” said Agamenon da Silva Menezes, 63, a cattle rancher and business leader who arrived here in 1985, opening a supply depot for gold prospectors. Hostility against the authorities simmers here after federal investigators in August arrested members of what they described as one of the Amazon’s largest land-grabbing gangs. The organization rapidly deforested lands around Novo Progresso before flipping them to buyers by using shell companies, prosecutors said. “I don’t regret deforesting land,” Ezequiel Castanha, a leader of the organization, who remains at large,
