Greece Dissolves Parliament to Prepare for Early Elections
The vote, which is due to be held Jan. 25, will pit the prime minister’s party against a left-wing party opposed to recent austerity measures.

Greece The vote, a constitutional requirement after Parliament failed to choose a president, is widely depicted as a referendum on the austerity measures imposed by the country’s creditors in return for multibillion-dollar bailouts. By tradition, the dissolution was announced in a decree posted at the door of the Parliament building in Athens. The dissolution followed a vote in Parliament on Monday when the government of Prime Minister  The ballot will pit Mr. Samaras’s conservative New Democracy party against the left-wing Syriza party led by  Syriza’s lead has narrowed in recent weeks, however, opening the way for smaller parties, some of them relatively new, to act as kingmakers if neither of the bigger contenders wins enough seats to control the 300-seat chamber outright. Mr. Samaras’s followers say that if Syriza wins and begins to redeem its pledges, Greece will plunge back into crisis and isolation. “This struggle will determine whether Greece stays in Europe,” Mr. Samaras told President Karolos Papoulias on Tuesday, according to Agence France-Presse. One of the new Parliament’s first tasks will be to elect a successor to Mr. Papoulias, 85, whose term expires in March. Syriza has said it wants to renegotiate two bailouts worth 240 billion euros, or about $292 billion, from Greece’s so-called troika of lenders — the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund — and to persuade creditors to write off some of the country’s crippling debts. Mr. Samaras’s governing coalition has, with some reluctance, pursued deeply unpopular austerity policies demanded by lenders and backed particularly by Germany. But early signs of economic improvement have not translated into tangible benefits for average Greeks laboring under a surge in joblessness and widespread hardship. The European battle lines over the election seemed to harden on Wednesday when Michael Fuchs, a senior member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party in Germany, warned Syriza to expect little sympathy. “The times when we had to rescue Greece are over,” he said in an interview in the Rheinische Post newspaper. “There is no longer any potential for blackmail. Greece does not have systemic meaning for the euro.” If Mr. Tsipras “believes he can pull back from the reform efforts and savings measures, then the troika will also have to pull back on credits for Greece,” Mr. Fuchs added.
