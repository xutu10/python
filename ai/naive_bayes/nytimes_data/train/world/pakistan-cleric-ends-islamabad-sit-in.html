A fiery antigovernment cleric in Islamabad ended his 65-day sit-in on Tuesday. The cleric, Muhammad Tahir-ul Qadri, announced that he would now tour major Pakistani cities to agitate for a “revolution of the poor.” For months, he and Imran Khan, a politician and former cricket star, have led thousands of followers who have camped out in front of the Parliament building, demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Though Mr. Sharif remains in office, Mr. Qadri said the sit-in had succeeded. “It has awakened the nation and played its role in the path of revolution,” he told supporters. Mr. Khan maintains that he will not end his protest in Islamabad, the capital, until Mr. Sharif resigns.
