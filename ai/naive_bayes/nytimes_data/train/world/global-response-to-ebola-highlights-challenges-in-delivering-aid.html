Global Response to Ebola Highlights Challenges in Delivering Aid
As medical teams head to Sierra Leone, a Doctors Without Borders director says a reliance on volunteers, without military aid in setting up facilities, remains a roadblock.

GENEVA — In the cool of a Geneva garden, Eugenia Cuesta and other volunteers spent two days this week wrestling in and out of protective suits and goggles, rehearsing the procedures for treating victims of the  “It’s scary for sure,” Ms. Cuesta said of her mission to fight an epidemic that has killed more than 4,000 people, including 233 health care workers. “But to be scared a certain amount is useful. It can protect you.” Two months after the  And yet the reliance on volunteers like Ms. Cuesta shows that the international effort is “still moving in the wrong direction,” according to Brice de le Vingne, operations director for  Mr. de le Vingne said the group had repeatedly asked countries to deploy military personnel, the quickest way to set up treatment centers, “but that’s not happening.” He said they preferred to leave the task to nongovernmental organizations “because they did not want to take the political responsibility.” A senior European diplomat in Geneva involved in health issues, who was not authorized to speak publicly, lamented the limited international response. “The scale of the epidemic is what the international community is still not getting,” the diplomat said. “It’s becoming obvious that what you need is to scale up by a factor of 20. There’s not enough international coordination and imagination going into this.” In Sierra Leone, which with Guinea and Liberia is bearing the brunt of the epidemic, Ms. Cuesta will join a treatment center that the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies opened last month. The unit is one of several initiatives aimed at bolstering Sierra Leone’s fight against the disease. Cuba sent 165 doctors and nurses last week, China has expanded a medical team deployed there, and British personnel are scouting sites for at least five new centers and 700 additional beds that will bring the total closer to the World Health Organization’s target of about 1,300 beds. In neighboring Liberia, the capacity of treatment centers has nearly doubled to about 615 beds in the past two weeks, according to the latest W.H.O. update, on Wednesday. It is expected to jump again in the next month or so to around 2,500 or more beds as the United States delivers on a  The World Food Program, acting beyond its core mandate as the United Nations agency responsible for fighting hunger, is also joining the drive, planning to build up to 30 Ebola treatment centers capable of handling 3,000 patients, said Denise Brown, the agency’s regional director for West Africa. Under targets set last month, the W.H.O. hopes that the campaign will enable 70 percent of Ebola victims to find care in these countries by the end of November, Mr. Norton said. At that level of treatment, health experts suggest, the rate of infection could be curbed and the caseload would start to decline. By the end of the year, the new strategy aims to have capital cities of the affected countries cleared of the disease and all burials conducted safely. But those targets appear remote from the reality on the ground. The disease is “entrenched” in the capitals of the three countries, Dr. Bruce Aylward, the deputy head of the W.H.O., said at a meeting attended by the three countries’ presidents in Washington this week. Medical organizations thought they had the Ebola outbreak in Guinea under control several months ago, said Mr. de le Vingne of Doctors Without Borders, but the United Nations now reports that the virus is taking off in new areas bordering Ivory Coast. Sierra Leone reports the same experience. “There is no evidence that the epidemic in West Africa is being brought under control,” the W.H.O.'s latest bulletin concluded. Moreover, treatment centers are useless without trained workers to manage and operate them, Mr. de le Vingne said. American troops are already on the ground in Liberia to build treatment centers, and Britain announced on Wednesday that it would send about 600 military personnel to Sierra Leone to build units and train local staff members. But it remains unclear who will manage and operate the units. As for Doctors Without Borders, it has increased its staffing in the three worst-hit countries to around 3,000 today from 600 at the beginning of August. That number includes about 280 international workers, and is now “absolutely at the limit of our capacity,” Mr. de le Vingne said. The fear and stigma associated with the Ebola virus contributes to recruitment problems. After Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines at the end of 2013, the W.H.O. had the support of 151 aid agencies. Six months into the Ebola crisis in three countries, only four medical organizations are on the ground. Ms. Cuesta, trained as an emergency response nurse, said she traveled to Haiti without a second thought to help fight the cholera outbreak that came after the 2010 earthquake. Yet her decision to volunteer in Sierra Leone took a month’s careful reflection and consultation with family and friends. Finding staffing for the center where Ms. Cuesta will be working has been “a bit of a headache,” said Saaristo Panu,the Red Cross’s emergency health coordinator. The unit opened last month with only 10 beds and despite the demand for treatment has yet to work at full capacity. Under these circumstances, the lack of an established evacuation procedure for medical workers is a particularly grievous omission, Mr. de le Vingne said. Medical evacuation should be possible in 24 hours, he said; last month, the evacuation of a French nurse who contracted the disease took 40 hours. The European Union announced Thursday that it would provide $3.8 million to fund such an operation, but no European country has stepped forward to provide the aircraft, personnel or other resources needed to make it work, Mr. de le Vingne said. “It still amazes me completely. It’s absolutely crazy,” he said. “What is missing is only political will.”
