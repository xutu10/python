The police said late Tuesday that they had fatally shot an 18-year-old man after he stabbed two counterterrorism officers in the southern state of Victoria. The police said the man, whose name was not given, had been displaying a flag linked to the Islamic State, while local news media reported he had been shouting insults about Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the government before he was shot and killed. Justice Minister Michael Keenan said Wednesday that the man was “a known terror suspect.” The two officers were hospitalized, one with serious wounds, the police said.
