The teenagers did not appear to be engaged in violent or provocative behavior at the time they were shot. Palestinian health officials determined that the teens, Nadeem Siam Nawara, 17, and Mohammad Mahmoud Odeh Salameh, 16, were killed by live ammunition.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has repeatedly said that he is committed to maintaining the status quo at the site, which allows Jews to visit but bans non-Muslim prayer. Yaakov Peri, a centrist Israeli minister and a former chief of Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency, strongly condemned the attacks on the mosque and the synagogue, describing them as “brutal.” “I hope that the security forces and the police will bring those terrorists to court as soon as possible,” he said at a meeting with international reporters.
