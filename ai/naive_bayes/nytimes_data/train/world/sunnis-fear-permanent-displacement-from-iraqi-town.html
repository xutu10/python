Sunnis Fear Permanent Displacement From Iraqi Town
Jurf al-Sakhar was recaptured from the Islamic State, but now Shiite-dominated forces say Sunnis cannot return to their homes for at least eight months.

JURF AL-SAKHAR, Iraq —  Capturing the Euphrates Valley farming town of Jurf al-Sakhar was arguably the Iraqi government’s first big success in reclaiming territory from Islamic State militants. But when they expelled the militants in late October, the Shiite-dominated Iraqi security forces and their allied militias also drove out the last of the town’s civilian residents — about 70,000 Sunnis. The town’s representative on the provincial council was its lone Sunni member, and he was found dead with a bullet through his forehead not long after the battle. Now the all-Shiite provincial council has barred any of the displaced Sunni residents from returning for at least eight to 10 months and possibly longer. The council says security forces need time to clear explosives left behind. But some former Sunni residents do not believe it. “There are concerns this could be ‘ethnic cleansing’ of Jurf al-Sakhar and the Baghdad belt,” said Maysoon al-Damluji, a lawmaker from a secular-Sunni political bloc. The town’s fate is an early test of the newly formed government’s commitment to rise above the violent sectarian politics that opened the door for the Islamic State to consolidate its hold on the country’s Sunni Arab-dominated regions. The battle was the first led in part by the newly appointed interior minister, Mohammed Salem al-Ghabban, a commander in a Shiite militia known for its deep ties to Iran. He, too, is being seen as an indicator of the new government’s professions of inclusiveness. President Obama and many Iraqis blame the abusive sectarian policies of the previous prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, for the alienation of the Sunni tribes. The installation this summer of a new prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, was hailed as the advent of a more equitable leadership that could better take on Islamic State, also known as  “Phase One was getting an Iraqi government that was inclusive and credible — and we now have done that,” Mr. Obama recently said in a televised interview. A spokesman for the Badr Organization, the Shiite militia and political party of the new interior minister, defended that assessment, arguing that the group was as committed as anyone to fair government for all Iraqis. The spokesman, Mueen al-Kadhimy, a Badr Organization lawmaker, said its militia was fighting with Sunni tribes to help Iraqi Sunnis who are being tyrannized by the Islamic State. “We cannot discount the Sunnis, nor can the Sunnis discount the Shia,” Mr. Kadhimy said, noting that Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani,  Mr. Kadhimy noted that the Badr Organization put forward Mr. Ghabban for interior minister in part to present a new face. Mr. Ghabban spent 15 years exiled in Iran during the rule of Saddam Hussein, but he also spent 10 years in Britain, where he earned a master’s degree in English literature from the University of London, Mr. Kadhimy said. Sunni lawmakers and residents of Adhamiya, a Sunni neighborhood of Baghdad, said in interviews that they were withholding judgment. But many Sunnis also complain that vigilante Shiite militias — most notoriously Asaib Ahl al-Haq — are still killing Sunni civilians with impunity. Even the ubiquitous government security vehicles and checkpoints all fly banners depicting Imam Hussein, the Shiite martyr killed in the battle that marked their break with the Sunnis. “Nobody can stand this,” said a Sunni real estate agent in Adhamiya who gave only a nickname, Abu Saad. “If we give our names, Asaib Ahl al-Haq will be here to kill us tomorrow.” Virtually the only Sunni-majority town in the Shiite-dominated province of Babil, Jurf al-Sakhar had been known as a haven for Sunni extremists for at least a decade, long before the fighters of the Islamic State invaded in April. That was when the town first came under heavy shelling by the government’s security forces, said Karem al-Atia, 50, a school principal, who fled with his family in May. “We were not with the Islamic State,” he said. “But the reason we could not stay was because the shelling drove us out.” In September, Mr. Abadi ordered an end to such indiscriminate shelling of Sunni neighborhoods, and Sunni residents of Jurf al-Sakhar began to return to their houses and farms even though the Islamic State still controlled the town, Mr. Atia said. Igab al-Janubi, the town’s representative on the provincial council and its lone Sunni member, and Ibrahim al-Janubi, a local judge who is a Sunni, were abducted that month. They were found dead in a Shiite majority town nearby. In late October, the pro-government forces began to face an explicitly sectarian deadline: Jurf al-Sakhar straddles a road traveled by thousands of pilgrims visiting the Shiite shrines of Karbala during the holy month of Muharram and the Ashura commemoration, and Islamic State fighters had threatened to slaughter any who passed. “The Shia pilgrims would not have been able to walk to Karbala,” said Falah Abdulkarim al-Khafaji, head of the defense committee of the Shiite-dominated provincial council now in charge of the town. So on the first day of the holy month, Oct. 24, army and police battalions, along with several big Shiite militias — Mr. Khafaji estimated that there were as many as 7,000 volunteers for what is now called the Battle of Ashura — began a two-day assault to take over the town. (Unlike other battles, the American-led coalition lent no air support, he said.) Mr. Khafaji said the pro-government forces presumed that any civilians in town at the time were extremists. "Without people supporting  ISIS fighters were shooting from the trees on farms there, he said. “If you were a security commander and when you pass this spot you get shot at, how would you react?” Mr. Khafaji asked. Mr. Ghabban was there during the battle, the first major government counteroffensive after he was appointed interior minister. Standing with him and helping to lead the fight were Hadi al-Amari, the head of the Badr Organization, and Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, commander of Iran’s Quds Force. The winners of the battle officially changed its name from Jurf al-Sakhar to Jurf al-Nasr — “the banks of victory” instead of “the banks of stone.” Today, it is a wasteland of demolished homes and flooded or burned fields. The highway is now lined with the flags of Shiite militias. Shiite banners fly from dozens of army and police checkpoints ringed with sandbags along the road. Mr. Khafaji, pointing out the town’s details from his S.U.V., said that at first, the displaced Sunni residents no longer wanted to return. But then he acknowledged that other factors might make Shiite officials slow to part with the town “Yes, good farmland, and good places for terrorists to hide,” he said. He said he understood that the Shiite flags at all the military and police positions might suggest sectarianism. But he added: “Should I say, ‘Take this flag down?’ We need them. And we have more fundamental issues to focus on, like fighting ISIS.”
