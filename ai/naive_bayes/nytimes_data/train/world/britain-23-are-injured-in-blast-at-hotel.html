At least 12 people were hurt in what the police said they suspected was a natural-gas explosion in the basement of a central London hotel just before midnight Friday. The Hyatt Regency London — The Churchill, a luxury hotel in Portman Square, was evacuated temporarily after the blast, which was believed to be in a kitchen area, and injured people were treated at the scene, the Metropolitan Police said. Six people were taken to hospitals. Most of the injured were believed to be kitchen staff. None of the injuries were thought to be life-threatening. Dennis Luwer, who lives opposite the hotel, told the BBC that a hole had been blown in the side of the building.
