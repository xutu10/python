In Ruins of Ukrainian Town, Residents Crave Food, Water and Peace
As residents began repairing the damage in Luhansk and taking stock of the calamity around them, many said they no longer cared about the politics that caused it all.

LUHANSK, Ukraine —  Rebel fighters picked their way through the debris of this city’s airport last week, pointing out the bloodstained stretchers and the corpse of a Ukrainian soldier tangled in the wreck of a burned vehicle. The battle for control of the city of Luhansk, one of the most ferocious of the six-month conflict in southeastern Ukraine, had left the airport and surrounding villages in ruins. The guns have fallen silent here since Russian artillery and troops helped break the siege of the city and led Ukrainian forces to abandon the airport on Sept. 1, but Luhansk remains on a war footing, without electricity and running water and with little food. Residents who survived the shelling in basements now spend their days fetching water, on bicycles and pulling shopping carts, and scouring the few stores that are open for food. Banks and offices are closed, and a mile-long line of cars stands outside the only functioning gas station. At the city hospital, 16 plain wood coffins buzzing with flies lie on the grass outside the morgue. With more than 500 dead in the city, there has not been enough space or electricity to keep them all in the cold room, workers said. “They had us by the neck,” said Nikolai Pesotskii, a hotel manager, who stayed in the city throughout the siege by Ukrainian forces. “I felt no one needed us. We were abandoned,” he said. “This was a ghost city.” The first sign of help, he said, came from a Russian convoy of aid, which entered Luhansk against the wishes of the Ukrainian government. “Without that, there would have been hunger,” Mr. Pesotskii said. A wealthy businessman, even he made use of a Russian food parcel, distributed from the local school, that contained canned meat, sugar and rice — enough for one person for 10 days, he said. As residents began sweeping up the damage in Luhansk, repairing roofs, replacing windows and taking stock of the calamity around them, many said they no longer cared about the politics that caused it all. Several suggested that President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine should just give in to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and cede this part of eastern Ukraine, the Donets coal basin, known as Donbass, in order to win peace. “Let Poroshenko give Donbass to Putin and let us live normally,” said a villager named Viktor, standing amid the ruins of his mother’s home on the edge of Luhansk. His mother died in the shelling, four generations who lived together in the house are now homeless, and the aviation factory where he worked was wrecked, he said. Like many in the region, he said he had more faith in Russia than the Ukrainian government to come to their aid. “How many years of independence did we have as Ukraine?” he said. “And what did they do?” Neither he nor his sister, a peasant woman in a Russian-patterned head scarf, expected anything from the separatist leaders who have declared a Luhansk People’s Republic in the region. “Where will they get the money?” she asked. “If they had money, they could have already started construction brigades or something.” She declined to give her name, reflecting a common reluctance here to speak freely against the rebel authorities. “I don’t care what country we live in or what it is called; I just want peace,” she said. “I just want gas, water and school for the children.” The family was living with others in the basement of the village school. Her 5-year-old granddaughter, hollow-eyed and mute, could not sleep, she said, but they could not afford the fare to send her to her aunt in Russia. Already a region of high unemployment and poverty, southeastern Ukraine faces an economic and humanitarian crisis, with more than 3,000 civilians killed and possibly as many combatants, billions of dollars of destruction to private and public buildings, and more than one million people displaced. “We are not scared,” said Vladimir Titov, a former factory worker now volunteering with the rebels. “We want a free administration. We don’t want to be under Russia. We want our own state, and we will pay our taxes and keep the money here.” Russia is already helping with free gas supplies to rebel-held areas, he said. Yet despite the bravado of the rebels, there is a growing realization here that Russia is not going to annex the Donbass region, as it did the strategic Crimea Peninsula in March, and that it may not help much beyond limited handouts of aid. “There are six million people in Donbass, and Putin does not need us,” said Yevgeny, a retired doctor living in the mining town of Snizhne. “He just needs to stir things up here, and that’s not good for us.” “We are all hard workers, we can rebuild, but without help it will be hard,” said Aleksandr, a post office worker in Luhansk whose neighborhood, Yubileinoye, was hit repeatedly by artillery strikes from both sides. As they contemplated the disaster of the war, some people signaled that they regretted the rush toward independence and the rapid escalation into war. “We were led like sheep,” said one woman in the neighboring region of Donetsk, who admits she voted for independence in the May referendum. She immediately asked not to be identified for fear of trouble from the separatist rebels in charge in her town. Several people interviewed, who asked not to be quoted by name, said much of the population was scared of the rebels, some of whom have abused their power by robbing banks, stealing cars and arresting people. Even as the separatists accuse Kiev of being influenced by fascist groups, people fear the consequences of the rebels’ running their region. “People are saying, ‘Give us anything but this — Germany, Hitler, whatever,’ ” one resident of the Luhansk region said. “Right now, people don’t want to discuss political and ideological things; they just want peace,” said Enrique Menendez, a Ukrainian blogger and activist from Donetsk. (His name comes from his Spanish grandfather, who settled in Ukraine after World War II.) “They want to stop the fighting and force it to go to a discussion of peace. I think the desire for peace is much higher in Donbass than elsewhere.” Mr. Pesotskii, whose hotel in Luhansk has been occupied by rebel soldiers, warned that more effort was needed to bring peace. “We need intensive talks at all levels,” he said. Despite a two-week cease-fire, fear among the people was growing, said Konstantyn Savinov, the deputy mayor of Donetsk, the largest city in rebel hands. Townspeople continue to die from the daily shelling in Donetsk, he said, and suffer from the persistent sense of uncertainty. “People want work, fair pay, products in the shops, calm in the streets, their children in school, the elder ones in university and plans for the future,” he said. “And so far, that has not been possible.” A businessman until he joined the city administration four years ago, he has managed to keep the city hall free from rebel control and its 1,000 municipal employees working despite an almost total cutoff of financing to the city from Kiev. The municipal workers have become heroes to many in the city as they fix the electricity and downed power lines even under shelling. Mr. Savinov warned that he had not received a penny for capital repairs and said the damage ran into the billions of dollars in Donetsk alone. But finding a way out is possible, he said. “Everyone needs to work on it.”
