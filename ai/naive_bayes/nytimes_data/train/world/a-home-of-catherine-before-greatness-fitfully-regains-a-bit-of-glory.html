A Home of Catherine, Before Greatness, Fitfully Regains a Bit of Glory
Dirk Herrmann is leading the restoration of the childhood home of Catherine the Great in Zerbst/Anhalt, Germany, but money is so tight he cannot afford even a tour guide.
===
ZERBST/ANHALT, Germany —  Like many a bored schoolchild, Dirk Herrmann would gaze out the window and daydream. Fittingly for a boy in a centuries-old town in what was then Communist East Germany, his was no ordinary castle in the air. His dream palace was built on the very real ruin near his classroom, the lone, surviving wing of a castle that epitomized how far Zerbst had fallen, ravaged by Germany’s violent 20th century. The Nazis, the Allies, the communists and the capitalists all wrought their worst here. Once, the ruin was the childhood home of the German princess who left for Russia in 1744 and won world acclaim as Catherine the Great. The Zerbst castle of her father became one of the finest in Central Europe, a three-winged Baroque marvel that had toilets even before the far grander Versailles. Today, Russian palaces connected to Catherine are resplendent, while Zerbst’s castle is a labor of love for Mr. Herrmann and his association of about 260 volunteers. Money is so tight they cannot even find — or pay — a guide who could keep their semi-restored castle open for visitors. Mr. Herrmann, 48, is an information technology specialist, running his own small firm in his hometown, 87 miles southwest of Berlin, which he said gave him the flexibility to devote time to the castle ruin. Both he and Andreas Dittmann, 47, who is the mayor of what is now officially known as Zerbst/Anhalt, remember the Zerbst of Communist days and emphasize that much else has been renovated — for instance, the magnificently restored buildings that now house city administration offices and archives, a small museum to Catherine the Great and a locally beloved cafe. From his school and his parents’ home, Mr. Herrmann said, he constantly saw the ruin. “I fantasized about what it must have looked like” before the fateful date of April 16, 1945, less than a month before World War II ended in Europe. As local legend has it, the Nazi commander here was refusing Allied demands to surrender. And so American planes — on perhaps their last such raid of the war — bombed Zerbst, then a town of some 15,000, swelled by refugees. Local records count 573 dead, mostly in cellars, and 80 percent of the buildings destroyed, including the ancient marketplace, two major churches and the castle. The castle burned for four days, yet photographs from 1946 clearly show that its three wings survived with outer walls and some interior and exterior features intact. Even minimal intervention to prop up the remains could have saved the entire ruin, Mr. Herrmann noted to visitors on a recent glorious morning. Enter Zerbst’s next misfortune: a zealous Communist mayor, Willi Wegener, who between 1948 and 1952 ordered the two best-preserved of the castle’s wings blown up. A similar fate befell dozens of castles across the Communist East, particularly after a 1949 law decreed that any abandoned structure — and most landowning aristocrats had fled West — could be destroyed and its brick and stone reused for needed new buildings. (“Pure political propaganda,” Mr. Herrmann commented.) Zerbst’s castle had not been abandoned by its former aristocratic owners, but was owned by a foundation before 1945, and from 1947 by the city itself. Most important, in 1953, the intervention of an official historian saved the third wing from destruction. For long decades it remained a decaying symbol of an age the Communists had willed bygone. Not that it faded entirely for Zerbsters. As Mayor Dittmann recalled, the ruin was formally fenced off, but almost everyone in town found a way into it at least once. Graffiti attest to vandalism — “incomprehensible,” in Mr. Herrmann’s view. The Communists did restore one building on the grounds: a large riding arena in Catherine’s 18th-century days, now a well-renovated performance site. And there was a yearly “people’s festival” in the beautiful park where the ruin stands, clearly a product of meticulous grand garden design in the 18th century. In winter, children sledded on the slopes and skated on the frozen pond. If accused of finding the castle a magnet, “I plead guilty,” the mayor said. To this day, the lonely five-story building, a few decaying sculptures on its facade, is a powerful, if painful, sight. Mr. Herrmann visits most days, overseeing its very gradual repair by his association, which since 2003 has raised and spent about $1.2 million and devoted many hours to the task. “We are just guaranteeing the very essence of the building,” Mr. Herrmann said, proudly noting every improvement as he took visitors through three partially renovated floors. “But this is not really restoration.” The job might have been easier without the promise of a five-star hotel made by some West Germans, who arrived after reunification in 1990. Like many Westerners who went East, sniffing an opportunity and painting false vistas of fortune to Easterners unversed in capitalism, they vanished. Next, a bitter, yearslong dispute arose over the property, involving state and city authorities as well as descendants of the Anhalt dukes who renounced the castle when the kaiser abdicated in 1918, at the end of World War I. Only when that dispute was finally resolved in favor of the city could Mr. Herrmann work on his dream. By then, the billions that flowed from West to East in the 1990s were drying up. Zerbst’s Communist-era apartment buildings had been spruced up, as were other parts of town and even the church ruins. But, for the castle, there was nothing. In the past three years, at least, Mr. Herrmann and his association kept the restored parts open for visitors, thanks to a federal grant and a willing pensioner. This year, that money ran out, and no volunteer could be found. So there was Mr. Herrmann on a recent day, denying entry to a schoolteacher with a cluster of history students who wanted to establish the link to Catherine the Great. “I am here almost every day, turning visitors away,” Mr. Herrmann said. Occasional concerts are held in summer months; in winter, the building is shut. The flow of tourists to Zerbst is meager, as the streets of the sleepy town suggest. Some Russians have discovered a recently designated Catherine the Great trail through old parts of the town she left at age 14, with no knowledge of Russia or its religion, to marry the man who became Czar Peter III. She ascended to the throne in 1762, and her husband was killed under mysterious circumstances. Catherine, who reigned until her death in 1796, never left Russia. In 2007, the Russian sculptor Mikhail V. Pereyaslavets gave Zerbst a rather girlish statue of the empress, now in the park. More important for Mr. Herrmann, the Russian historians and restorers who have returned Catherine’s Tsarskoye Selo palace outside St. Petersburg to its former great glory have paid some heed to Zerbst. “Imagine,” he said, “they are a Unesco world monument, and we are just a microscopic volunteer group.” He gazed with warmth and reproach at pictures the Russians have lent, documenting their work. In particular, he lingered before photos that show Tsarskoye Selo right after World War II, when the Nazis laid it to waste. “Look what they did to restore it,” Mr. Herrmann said. “And our castle was in a similar state, and was destroyed.” “I would so love to have done more in recent years,” he sighed. “But it all depends on subsidies, and this is what,” for all his dreams, “I cannot change.”
