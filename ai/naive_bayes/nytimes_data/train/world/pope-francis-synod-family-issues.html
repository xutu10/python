Pope Francis, Opening Meeting on Family Issues, Urges Open Dialogue
The two-week assembly of bishops is expected to take up issues like divorce and remarrying and could lead to a revision of some church positions.

VATICAN CITY — Setting the tone for a two-week meeting of Roman Catholic bishops,  “Do not say: I cannot say this, if I do they will think badly of me. Speak freely of everything you believe,” Francis instructed the nearly 200 prelates assembled in the Vatican for the synod, which will chart the church’s course regarding family life in contemporary society. “It is necessary to say everything that in the Lord we feel must be said,” without any concern that it might contradict the pope, he said. Holding back discussion “is not good,” Francis added, even as he exhorted the participants to “listen with humility and accept with an open heart all that our brothers say.” The  The groundwork for the meeting was laid, in part, by a questionnaire sent last year to bishops' conferences around the world to gather opinions from Catholics. Responses on the acceptance of church teachings on issues like birth control, premarital sex and gay unions helped to form the so-called Instrumentum Laboris, or working paper of the synod. The Rev. Bruno Forte, secretary general of the synod, said at a news conference on Monday that 84 percent of all episcopal conferences had responded to the questionnaire. “That tells us that the church felt the need to participate,” he said. The seemingly collegial run-up to the meeting has raised expectations that the church might change some of its positions affecting family life — for example, by allowing divorced and remarried Catholics who have not obtained an annulment to receive holy communion. But Vatican experts cautioned against expecting big changes. “Pope Francis has a habit of raising expectations because he’s willing to take a fresh look at things, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that change is coming,” said John Thavis, a longtime Vatican analyst. “But I think that if change doesn’t come, it will be experienced as a great disappointment.” Introducing the main points that the synod should address over the next two weeks, Cardinal Peter Erdo, the archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest in Hungary, stressed Monday that church teaching remained valid when it came to issues like the “indissolubility of marriage” as well as divorce and remarriage. “In the case of a consummated sacramental marriage, after a divorce, a marriage recognized by the church is impossible, while the first spouse is still alive,” he said. At the same time, the cardinal said that the church should seek ways to provide pastoral care for divorced and remarried Catholics, and also suggested ways the church might simplify the annulment process to allow more Catholics to remarry, should the church accept the first marriage as invalid. “Divorced and civilly remarried persons belong to the church,” he said. “They need and have the right to receive care from their pastors.” He also suggested that “clear guidelines” were necessary for pastors to assist couples in difficulty, including separated or cohabitating couples, to be a more inclusive institution, as Pope Francis has urged on  On Monday, testimony by an Australian couple married for 55 years demonstrated the church’s efforts to understand the lives of ordinary Catholics. Describing a union based on sexual attraction and the raising of four children, the couple said church documents on marriage “seemed to be from another planet with difficult language and not terribly relevant to our own experiences.” They also referred to the experience of friends with a gay son. They called on the prelates to find “new ways and relatable language to touch people's hearts” and find ways for parishes to open their doors and welcome those that have gone against church teachings. As Mr. Thavis, the Vatican analyst, put it, this willingness to engage the world “is fairly new for the leadership of the church.”
