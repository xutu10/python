THE HAGUE —  After four years of hearings and hundreds of witnesses, the war crimes trial of  In his closing statement, Mr. Karadzic said that if the court, known as the  Mr. Karadzic, 69, insisted on acting as his own lawyer, but he also worked with a legal team that included Peter Robinson, an American lawyer. Last week, Mr. Robinson spoke in Mr. Karadzic’s defense on the gravest charges — two counts of genocide — saying that he had neither knowledge of nor intent to commit the mass murders of  The trial ended on a heated note, with sharp exchanges. Mr. Robinson told the three judges hearing the case that if they agreed to the prosecution’s “legal lynching,” they would be “convicting an innocent man.” Mr. Karadzic — the ex-fugitive whose astonishing career has included stints as a psychiatrist, a poet, a politician,  During Mr. Karadzic’s often-rambling presentations, he remained polite to the judges and even to prosecutors. Mr. Karadzic’s broad line of defense was that the Bosnian war erupted because the Serbs, predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christians, needed to defend themselves against a new Bosnian Muslim separatist regime determined to create an Islamic state. The prosecution, led by another American lawyer, Alan Tieger, has said that Mr. Karadzic was himself commander of a separatist Serb government that set out to remove non-Serbs from all areas of  In the resulting 1992 campaign, which came to be known as ethnic cleansing, hundreds of thousands of Muslims and ethnic Croats, largely Roman Catholic, were driven from their villages, their homes looted and their mosques and churches demolished. In many cases, men and boys were rounded up and held in concentration camps, where thousands were tortured and executed or died of starvation, prosecutors said. Women were raped or used as sex slaves. These crimes, prosecutors say, constitute genocide. The prosecution has also accused Mr. Karadzic of organizing the three-year siege of the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. An estimated 12,000 Sarajevans were killed. But the single crime that has provoked the greatest international outrage involves the  Mr. Robinson said that even though the Srebrenica massacre was one of the world’s best-documented crimes, there was no evidence that Mr. Karadzic had planned or ordered the executions. Mr. Tieger responded that Mr. Karadzic had lied and mischaracterized events, presented unsupported statements and “invented a new reality.” In his final statement, Mr. Karadzic struck a different tone. If the Serbs, Croats and Muslims had wanted to live in a secular state, without building religion into it, “we could have lived together, each in their own canton.” He went on: “I apologize to everyone for my amateurism, but my thirst for the truth is much stronger than my legal knowledge.” A verdict is expected next year.
