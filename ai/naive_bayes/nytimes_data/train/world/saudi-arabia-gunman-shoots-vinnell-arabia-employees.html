BEIRUT, Lebanon — A man opened fire on two American employees of a United States military contractor in a car at a gas station in Riyadh, the capital of  The shooting, reported more tersely by the official Saudi Press Agency, came amid heightened concern about possible reprisal attacks by Islamic militants against the United States and Saudi Arabia, which are collaborating in a military coalition against the Islamic State, the extremist group that has seized parts of Syria and Iraq. Saudi security forces rushed to the scene of the shooting, where they exchanged fire with the gunman before wounding him and taking him into custody, the Saudi Press Agency account said, quoting a police spokesman. The Saudi account did not identify the Americans or the shooter, and did not give possible motives for the attack. But one American official, who declined to be identified because the matter was under investigation, said that initial reports from Saudi officials suggested that the shooter may have been a disgruntled former employee who holds dual Saudi and American citizenship. Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that the Americans were employees of  Ms. Psaki said the gas station was approximately half a mile from the Vinnell Arabia base in Riyadh and about 20 miles away from the United States Embassy. “We are in close contact with the Saudi government as we continue to gather details about the shooting and motive,” Ms. Psaki said. “We are in the process of evaluating our security posture and will take appropriate steps to ensure the safety of all U.S. Mission personnel.” Saudi Arabia’s monarchy has long had close ties with Washington. But anti-Western sentiments are strong among parts of the Saudi population, and the kingdom has experienced domestic terrorist attacks over the years. At the same time, hundreds of Saudi citizens have traveled to Iraq and Syria to join jihadist militant groups there, raising fears that they could return to carry out attacks at home. Ms. Psaki said the embassy in Riyadh was issuing a security advisory to American citizens in the country to “advise them on the situation and any safety precautions they should take.” Such messages, she said, “are regularly issued by embassies and consulates abroad to provide timely and important safety and security information to U.S. citizens living or traveling in their districts.”
