Catalonia’s Leader Plays Down Talk of Secession Crisis
In an interview, Artur Mas indicated that if he could not hold a legal vote on separation from Spain, he would pursue a longer-term strategy for independence.

BARCELONA, Spain —  The Catalan leader, Artur Mas, says Catalonia remains on track for its scheduled Nov. 9 vote on whether to break from  The remarks provided the first glimmer of willingness by Mr. Mas, a late but staunch convert to secessionism, to ensure that Catalonia would not be responsible for provoking a crisis in Spain. Catalonia, Spain’s economic powerhouse, is trying to go ahead with a secession vote that the central government in Madrid has vowed to block. Mr. Mas nevertheless indicated that if he could not hold a legal vote on separation, he would pursue a longer-term strategy to achieve an independent Catalonia by calling for new elections for the regional Parliament “as a plebiscite.” Mr. Mas, who signed a  He said that his government had initially hoped to follow Scotland’s example and persuade the government of Mr. Rajoy to allow a vote on independence. Mr. Rajoy’s government has steadfastly refused, and, if anything, it has been emboldened by the failure of the Scottish vote. Mr. Mas said that he would hold a vote without Mr. Rajoy’s approval, but not illegally, though he complained that the Spanish judiciary was biased against Catalonia’s interests. “The only plan is to vote on Nov. 9, and we will consider all the possible ways that take us within the law toward that point,” he said. Spain’s Constitutional Court recently ordered the suspension of the Catalan campaign pending a final ruling on its legality. Mr. Mas is hoping for an early ruling, but the court could take as long as five months to decide. For now, Mr. Mas said his Convergence Party had agreed with other pro-secession parties to try “another way” in the coming days to circumvent legal and political opposition from Madrid, though he would not say what Catalonia would do. After that, he said, “we have a third instrument, which we don’t want to use today, which is elections as a plebiscite” on independence, which would most likely leave the regional Parliament with a more hard-line majority of secessionist lawmakers. Mr. Mas has previously said that “there is no Plan B” to the scheduled Nov. 9 vote on separation. Calling a Catalan parliamentary election is only a last alternative, he said in the interview, kept “in a drawer that is closed at the moment, but not empty.” He added, “This drawer can only be opened if there is a consensus among the political formations that are pro-independence — and at this moment there isn’t.” Mr. Mas said he did not envisage resigning even if Catalans could not vote on schedule. But a failure to hold the vote would be a major setback for Mr. Mas. The Catalan leader has fanned expectations for independence among Catalans since a falling-out with Spanish leadership two years ago, after Mr. Rajoy rejected a Catalan request to reduce its fiscal contribution to a Spanish system that redistributes tax revenue from rich to poor regions. That fiscal dispute coincided with hundreds of thousands filling downtown Barcelona to push for independence on Catalonia’s national day. Catalonia has 7.5 million people, or 16 percent of Spain’s population, and it is Spain’s most powerful economic region, accounting for 19 percent of the national output. Catalonia’s bitterness over Spanish leadership remains. Mr. Mas said Catalans were entitled to feel without even “a minimum of confidence that the institutions of the state act fairly” toward the region. “I’ve evolved just like the majority of the Catalan society,” Mr. Mas said Tuesday. "I don’t believe anymore in the Spanish state of the 19th and 20th century because that is as a state in which we tried to do everything possible to fit in well and we didn’t manage.” Rather than dialogue, Mr. Rajoy created a climate of “institutional hostility, which isn’t normal in a Spanish democracy that should already be mature,” Mr. Mas argued. Mr. Rajoy has accused Mr. Mas of pushing Catalonia into a corner by raising false expectations among its citizens and signing a decree to hold an independence vote that Mr. Mas knew would violate Spain’s Constitution. Mr. Mas, however, said it was his duty to fight for Catalan citizens who wanted to vote on their future, even if the result of such a vote was uncertain. “The one who fights can win or lose, but the one who doesn’t fight has already lost,” he said. In a separate interview on Tuesday, Carme Forcadell, the president of the Catalan National Assembly, a citizens’ platform that has organized the most recent pro-independence demonstrations, predicted Catalans would not turn to violence or civil disobedience if no vote took place on Nov. 9, “as long as people can see that it’s really because of the Spanish state rather than our politicians giving up.” She added, “We’re a very mature people, which has gone through a lot of suffering and knows the only way forward is democratically and peacefully.”
