The  The organization had been saying that the number of new cases was about 1,000 per week for the past four weeks, and that the mortality rate for Ebola had been around 50 percent. The updated figures were provided by Dr. Bruce Aylward, the health organization’s assistant director general, during a  He also said that as of Tuesday, the total number of Ebola cases over the course of the epidemic had reached 8,914, with 4,447 deaths. The vast majority are in the three most afflicted countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Dr. Aylward, an infectious disease specialist who just completed a visit to West Africa, said the health organization was particularly focused on isolating 70 percent of new patients in the next two months — to remove them from situations in which they can pass the disease to others and begin reversing the tide of the Ebola virus. While Dr. Aylward acknowledged the recent surge in international pledges to combat Ebola’s spread, he said that without a further escalation in help over the next 60 days, “a lot more people will die.” Dr. Aylward also expressed concern about the need for greater coordination among the many medical and charitable groups that are now helping in West Africa. “There’s a lot of actors on the ground, and an awful lot of them are working with Ebola for the first time,” he said. “The challenge right now is making sure all of that adds up to the kind of plan to stop this disease.” In another cautionary note, he warned that the ramped-up response could invite complacency and false hope. “Any sense that the great effort that’s been kicked off in the last couple of months is already starting to see an impact — that would be really, really premature,” he said.
