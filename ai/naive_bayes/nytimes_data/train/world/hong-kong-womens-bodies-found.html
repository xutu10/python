HONG KONG — A 29-year-old British man was arrested in  The man had called the police at 3:42 a.m. Saturday to ask that they investigate an incident at the apartment in the Wan Chai district of the city, the police said in a statement. When they arrived, officers found a woman between the ages of 25 and 30 with cuts on her throat and buttocks. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Later, the police found the second woman, with injuries to her neck, in the suitcase. The man, who was also in the apartment, was arrested. The police did not disclose the man’s name. One resident of the apartment building, who refused to give his name, said he lived near the 31st floor. “We noticed a strong smell about noon yesterday; it was like rotting fish or something,” he said. “I think that was right before the police came, or right after, when they discovered the body.” A spokesman at the British Foreign Office in London confirmed that a male British national had been arrested in Hong Kong and that he and his family had been receiving consular assistance. The spokesman didn’t identify the person. Hong Kong is a former British colony. Murders are rare in Hong Kong. In the first seven months of this year, just 14 homicides were recorded in this city of 7.2 million. By comparison, 256 homicides were recorded in New York City, which is home to 8.4 million people, this year to Oct. 19, according to the New York City Police Department. One of the grisliest murders in Hong Kong involving an expatriate occurred in 2003 when the body of Robert Kissel, an investment banker, was found four days after his death in the storage room of his luxury apartment. His wife, Nancy Kissel, was convicted of murdering him in a case labeled the “milkshake murder” after prosecutors said she had incapacitated him with a drug that she put in a strawberry milkshake before bludgeoning him with a brass figurine.
