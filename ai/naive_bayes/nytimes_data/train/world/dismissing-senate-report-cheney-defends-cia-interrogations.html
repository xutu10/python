Dismissing Senate Report, Cheney Defends C.I.A. Interrogations
Former Vice President Dick Cheney said that the C.I.A.'s harsh interrogations of terrorism suspects a decade ago were “absolutely, totally justified.”

WASHINGTON — Former Vice President  Mr. Cheney, who was a vocal champion of those techniques after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and has never accepted the widespread description of them as torture, said he had not read the report that the Intelligence Committee is expected to release on Tuesday. But from news reports about it, he said he had heard nothing to change his mind about the wisdom and effectiveness of the program. “What I keep hearing out there is they portray this as a rogue operation and the agency was way out of bounds and then they lied about it,” he said in a telephone interview. “I think that’s all a bunch of hooey. The program was authorized. The agency did not want to proceed without authorization, and it was also reviewed legally by the Justice Department before they undertook the program.” Mr. Cheney said he never thought the C.I.A. was withholding information from him or the White House about the nature of the program, nor did he think the agency exaggerated the value of the intelligence gained from waterboarding and other techniques. The reported conclusion by the Senate Intelligence Committee that the C.I.A. misled the White House, he added, “is just a crock.” “They deserve a lot of praise,” Mr. Cheney said. “As far as I’m concerned, they ought to be decorated, not criticized.” He said critics had forgotten that the purpose was to prevent another Sept. 11. “When we had that program in place, we kept the country safe from any more mass casualty attacks, which was our objective,” he said. The program, he added, was “the right thing to do, and if I had to do it over again, I would do it.” In speaking out, Mr. Cheney added his voice to others already anticipating the 6,000-page report, produced by the Democratic-led Intelligence Committee after years of study. The report is said to assert that the C.I.A. overstated the results of brutal interrogations and to conclude that they did not yield intelligence preventing major attacks that could not be otherwise obtained. Former President George W. Bush spoke out in an interview shown on CNN over the weekend backing the C.I.A. leaders, calling them “patriots” and saying any report that diminished them was “off base.” Some former Bush administration officials had urged that he seize on the report’s conclusions to distance himself from the program, but he and his top advisers rejected that suggestion. Mr. Cheney went further than Mr. Bush by arguing that the program itself was worth it. And he suggested that the Democrats on the Senate committee were trying to rewrite history to absolve themselves of their own involvement as legislative overseers. “It occurs to me it was sort of a cover for those on the Democratic side who were briefed on the program, but then were subsequently embarrassed to admit that and so are going back to construct a rationale to say, ‘They didn’t tell us the truth,'” Mr. Cheney said. The former vice president said the Senate committee did not interview him or offer him a chance to read the report and provide his own response before making it public. Once it is released, he said he planned to speak out more to back the C.I.A. veterans involved. “I felt an obligation to make it clear that I strongly support them,” he said.
