A Thai court sentenced Akkaradet Eiamsuwan, 24, to two and a half years in prison on Tuesday for posting a message on Facebook that the court said insulted King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 86. A Criminal Court judge found Mr. Akkaradet, a university student, guilty of violating Thailand’s lèse-majesté law, which punishes people who defame, insult or threaten the monarchy. Mr. Akkaradet was arrested in June and has been in jail since. The role of the monarchy in Thailand has come under scrutiny in recent years because of concerns about succession in light of the king’s age and ill health.
