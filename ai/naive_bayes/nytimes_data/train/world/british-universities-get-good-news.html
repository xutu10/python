British Universities Get Good News
A study released this month says that by 2024, Britain will add 83,000 foreign graduate students to the nearly quarter-million it hosted in 2013.

THE HAGUE — Amid fears that bureaucracy and high costs could diminish  The study, released by the British Council this month, predicts that by 2024 Britain will add 83,000 international graduate students to the 223,745 it hosted in 2013. Of those, 44 percent will come from China, which currently accounts for about 22 percent of international graduate students in Britain. But the report, “Postgraduate Student Mobility Trends to 2024,” also raised some concerns. At an estimated yearly growth of 3.5 percent from 2013 to 2024, Britain’s power to attract foreign graduate students will have weakened compared to the five years leading up to 2012, when British universities registered 4.1 percent growth in that sector. The figures also suggest a growing reliance on China, which, though currently the biggest provider of international postgraduate students, is expected to send fewer students as its population ages. “The U.K. can’t just sit up and look at its historical position in this market,” said Jo Attwooll, the senior policy manger at Universities UK, an association that represents the country’s universities. “There is a growing amount of competition from other countries.” The day the study was released, a recruitment film was being shot on the campus of University of Derby, a middle-sized university in central England. The university boasts small class sizes and good connections with several global companies, like Rolls-Royce, Bombardier and Toyota, which have offices in and around the town of Derby. It has an excellent employability rate for graduates. “You can’t expect people in China to know about Derby,” said Nick Slade, the university’s director of international development. Which is one of the reasons why the recruitment video features, among other international students, a Chinese student who describes her experience at Derby in Mandarin. Like other promotional material, the video will be posted on the university’s Chinese website. “The actual students speak English well enough to read the English site, but it may be that their parents want to read the Chinese,” Mr. Slade said. Mr. Slade said competition for international students has become so strong among smaller, midlevel universities in Britain that Derby, which has about 1,000 international students, has pulled out all the stops, including offering pickup service from the airport and a buddy system to ease transition and getting the local police constable to set up a registration desk at the school so that foreign students no longer have to make the trek to the police station to register. “Everybody is offering more,” he said. Although the student mobility report does not include ancillary information such as  Besides graduate students from China, Britain will continue to attract students from India; Britain is the second most popular destination for Indian students (many more Indian students go to the United States). By 2024, the study predicts, more graduate students will come to Britain from Nigeria than from India. Attracting overseas graduate students, in particular, is important to universities. Not only do they bring their talents and skills to research and teaching, but foreign postgraduate students also tend to pay more in tuition than their undergraduate counterparts. Zainab Malik, the research director at the British Council, author of the study, said she was impressed by how British institutions would rely on just a few countries to fill their ranks of international graduate students. Like other experts, she encouraged British universities to diversify. “China is nothing to scoff at,” she said, referring to the country’s vast output of international graduate students. “But if half of your growth comes from China, that is perfectly good and perfectly respectable — but it is risky.” Dr. Shaun Curtis, director of the international development and recruitment office at the University of Exeter, agreed. “You want an international population, and that means recruiting the best and brightest from all around the world,” he said, explaining that Exeter was actively searching for smaller, growing markets like India or countries in sub-Saharan Africa to reduce the heavy reliance on Chinese students. The shift toward a diverse international field is quite expensive, said Dr. Curtis, whose department, International Exeter, employs 31 people, with two other full-time employees assisting with recruitment in Bangalore, India. Exeter’s attempts to diversify its international student population and reduce its reliance on China appear to be working. While 38 percent of the roughly 4,000 international students came from China in 2012, this year only 32 percent are Chinese. Dr. Curtis said that these changes in Exeter’s recruitment of international students have nothing to do with an anti-Chinese bias. Rather, the university is focused on bringing a diverse group of international students to a wide range of courses, subjects and academic levels.
