Chilean officials said Thursday that they had arrested three members of an anarchist cell suspected in the country’s worst bomb attack in more than two decades. One of the suspects is believed to have carried out the attack while two others were accomplices, said Interior and Security Minister Rodrigo Peñailillo, who did not release their names. The explosion on Sept. 8 scattered shrapnel across a crowded underground shopping area connected to a subway station, wounding 14 people. A declaration published Thursday on an anarchist website in the name of a faction of the Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire claimed responsibility for the attack, but insisted that their target “was not consumers or workers, but the structures, properties and enforcers of power.” Local media reports quoted a defense lawyer, Eduardo Camus, as saying that the three suspects denied any wrongdoing.
