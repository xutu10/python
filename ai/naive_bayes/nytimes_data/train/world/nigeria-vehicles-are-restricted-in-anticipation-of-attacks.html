The Nigerian authorities have banned automobile traffic in two northeastern states, out of concern that Islamic extremists are plotting attacks over the Christmas holiday. The military banned all traffic from 6 p.m. Wednesday until 7 a.m. Sunday in Borno State, a military spokesman, Col. Sani Usman, said. Borno is the home of Boko Haram, the militant Islamic group that has claimed responsibility for many car bombings, suicide bombings and kidnappings. The military imposed the ban based on security reports that Boko Haram was planning “massive attacks,” especially in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, Colonel Usman said. Lesser restrictions were imposed in neighboring Yobe State, where vehicles were not permitted to enter or leave the state, but traffic was permitted to move freely within towns except during an overnight curfew.
