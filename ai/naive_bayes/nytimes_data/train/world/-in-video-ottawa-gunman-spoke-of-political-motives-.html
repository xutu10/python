 In Video, Ottawa Gunman Spoke of Political Motives 
While the police did not release the video, an official said it provided persuasive evidence that the attack was motivated by the gunman’s ideology.

OTTAWA — The gunman who  The official, Commissioner Bob Paulson of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, said in a statement that the video contained “persuasive evidence that Michael Zehaf-Bibeau’s attack was driven by ideological and political motives.” The police did not release the video, and Mr. Paulson gave no further details about its contents. Mr. Paulson also addressed questions about how  The weekend brought the return of some normalcy to the Canadian capital, including the resumption of the hockey season for the Ottawa Senators, who postponed a home game last Wednesday because of the attack; they beat the New Jersey Devils at home Saturday night. The Parliamentary grounds in central Ottawa reopened to the public over the weekend, and  Mr. Vickers has gone from being known mainly for parading a ceremonial mace through the halls of Parliament, while wearing robes and a sword, to being the man who ran toward the gunfire and stopped Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau. The most  Citing accounts from guards and other unnamed sources,  Mr. Vickers’s office is just around the corner. Hearing the gunfire, he picked up his automatic handgun and moved toward the pillar shielding Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau from guards and Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers. That put him about 2 feet away from the gunman. According to the radio program, Mr. Vickers could see the barrel of Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau’s Winchester hunting rifle sticking out. At that point Mr. Vickers, 58, dived to the floor, spinning around to land on his back while repeatedly firing his gun until it was empty. The gunman collapsed to the ground and the other members of the security group moved in and fired their guns as well. Several bullet holes are now visible in and around the alcove. The governing Conservatives, including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and the opposition New Democratic Party were holding their weekly caucus meetings in large rooms on either side of the Hall of Honor during the shootout. Confusion and then attempts at self-protection ruled in both rooms, according to accounts from several members of Parliament. The Conservatives rushed to pile up the heavy, green, leather-covered chairs against the doors, an effort apparently led by David Wilks and Rob Clarke, who were members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police before turning to politics. But once the rearrangement was complete, someone recalled that the doors opened outward, making the barricade of marginal value. As Mr. Harper, whose police bodyguards were outside the room, was put into a tiny enclosure that was either a closet or a translator’s booth, his party members tore down about a dozen flagpoles mounted in the walls of the mural-lined room that was once used for reading newspapers and magazines. They had planned to use them as spears or clubs if the room had been invaded. But the only incursions came from the prime minister’s bodyguards, who whisked him away, and Mr. Vickers, who stopped by after reloading his gun. “I engaged the suspect, and the suspect is deceased,” he told the politicians using a microphone, according to the radio program. Across the hall, the New Democrats later found that a bullet had penetrated their meeting room’s outer door before lodging in its inner one. Mr. Vickers went back to work the next morning. His only comment was given in  He was, however, praised by all the party leaders when Parliament resumed Thursday. And he seemed particularly approving of a suggestion from Elizabeth May, the Green Party leader. “The finest thing that we could do for him right now would be to let him leave this place and go fly-fishing on the Miramichi,” she said, prompting a grin and a thumbs-up from Mr. Vickers.
