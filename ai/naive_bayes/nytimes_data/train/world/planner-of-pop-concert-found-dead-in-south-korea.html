SEOUL, South Korea —  A South Korean man involved in planning an outdoor pop concert where 16 people were killed after falling through a ventilation grate was found dead Saturday in an apparent suicide, officials said, as doctors continued to treat eight people facing life-threatening injuries from the accident. The man, 37, an employee of the Gyeonggi Institute of Science and Technology Promotion, was found dead around 7 a.m. in Seongnam, the city south of Seoul where Friday’s accident occurred, said Kim Nam-jun, a city spokesman. The site of the man’s death was not far from where 16 people died while watching the performance by 4Minute, a girl band that is popular across Asia. The spokesman for the city added that it was believed that the grate collapsed under the concertgoers’ weight. Park Jeong-ju, a police inspector, said it appeared that the dead man, who had been questioned by the police on Friday about the accident, later leapt from the top of a 10-story building. The Gyeonggi institute was one of the sponsors of the concert, which was organized by the news site Edaily and was part of a festival. About 700 people had gathered to watch the concert, which ended after the accident. Most of those who were killed were men in their 30s and 40s, while five were women in their 20s and 30s, fire officials said.
