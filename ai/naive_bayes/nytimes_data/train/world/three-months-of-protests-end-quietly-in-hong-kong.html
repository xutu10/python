HONG KONG —  Pro-democracy protests that swept onto the streets of  After almost three months of tumult, the street protests have dwindled to a few dozen tents in the Causeway Bay area, a hectic shopping district, where dozens of protesters waited to be evicted, accompanied by similar numbers of journalists. Before the police moved in, most of the remaining protesters were packing away their tents and sleeping bags on a road of shops and malls festooned with Christmas decorations. Many said the police were unlikely to encounter any forceful resistance. “Of course, it feels sad,” said Leo Chan, 24, a waiter who was rolling up his tent. “There’s no way we can feel satisfied. We didn’t achieve anything,” he added. “But it’s not the end. It’s essential for the protest forces to continue.” The  On Sunday night, the small protest area overflowed with people making a last visit to the last street camp before it disappeared. Hundreds lined up to have T-shirts and bags stenciled with slogans and images from the democracy movement. “We achieved something,” said Teresa Liu, a student who said she had regularly stayed at the camp since Sept. 29. “We achieved international notice, and since we got notice, China has no excuse to hide anymore.” But the Hong Kong government gave no substantial concessions, and the protest movement increasingly succumbed to exhaustion and internal fractures.

On Monday, the Hong Kong High Court was due to hold a hearing for Mr. Wong, the slight, bespectacled 18-year-old who became the best-known leader of the protests. He and others face contempt of court charges stemming from their roles in opposing the police clearance of the Mong Kok camp. A few dozen protesters have also continued to camp on space around the Legislative Council’s building near Admiralty. Officials from the legislature had to give their approval before the police could enter the area to remove the protesters, the police have said. The local news media, citing police sources, said that area would also be cleared on Monday. “We still haven’t got what we wanted,” said Jerry Lau, 34, a former driver who was among the protesters at the city legislature building. “I stayed here for over 70 days, so we still want a result.”
