CAIRO —  Fighting between Islamist militias and rival groups in a western Libyan town has killed at least 23 people, a hospital official said Sunday. The intense battle in Kikla also left 43 people wounded, mainly from shrapnel wounds, said the official, Emad Khalifa Abdul-Salam of the Gharyan hospital, southwest of the capital, Tripoli. The fighting is part of a nationwide power struggle between Islamist-backed militias, which have seized control of most of Tripoli, including its international airport, and their opponents, who back an internationally recognized government based in the far eastern part of the country. The anti-Islamist Zintan militia, named for its hometown in the west, attacked Kikla, an Islamist stronghold, on Saturday. A commander in the Islamist militias, known as Libya Dawn, said the Zintan militia, with the backing of local tribes, was able to seize parts of Kikla and briefly cut roads between Kikla and Gharyan, about 50 miles southwest of Tripoli. But the Libya Dawn fighters forced them to retreat, allowing traffic to resume, the commander said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. Facebook pages affiliated with the Zintan militias showed pictures of Libya Dawn vehicles they claimed to have seized in the fighting. Libya Violence and rivalries between political groups, backed by supportive militias, have deeply split the country, which currently has two rival governments and parliaments. Fighting in the east has intensified as troops loyal to Gen. Khalifa Hifter have battled more radical Islamic militias. The two sides are currently fighting over an eastern airport. In a rare visit to Tripoli on Saturday, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, urged all factions to stop the fighting and endorsed a reconciliation process with talks between rival legislators. The talks, sponsored by the United Nations, also aim to include armed groups. The United Nations says hundreds of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the militia fighting, including 100,000 in just the past three weeks.
