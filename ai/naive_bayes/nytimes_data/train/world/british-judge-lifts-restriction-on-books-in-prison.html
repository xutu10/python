British Judge Lifts Restriction on Books in Prison
A policy had prohibited inmates from receiving books unless they had earned the right through good behavior to buy them through the Prison Service.

LONDON — A High Court justice on Friday struck down a ban on sending books to prisoners, a policy that had been opposed by  In his ruling, the justice, Lawrence Collins, said that treating access to literature as a privilege was “strange,” adding that while the Prison Service had no outright ban on books — just receiving packages containing them — “the severity of the restrictions clearly may prevent acquisition and possession.” The ruling was a blow to Britain’s secretary of state for justice, Chris Grayling, who tightened the rules on privileges granted to inmates in November 2013 and whose tough stance on the issue had made him the target of a campaign by angry writers. Several writers protested, including the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy. One novelist, Kathy Lette, even named an unsympathetic character after him. Other critics included Denis MacShane, a member of the opposition Labour Party who was released from prison in February after serving a short sentence for making false expense claims. Under Mr. Grayling’s policy, inmates were allowed to use prison libraries or to buy books through the Prison Service. The Ministry of Justice argued that prisoners needed incentives as part of their rehabilitation and should earn privileges, including the right to buy objects from the outside world. It also said that searching parcels sent to prison took up valuable time and resources. The ruling on Friday came after a challenge by Barbara Gordon-Jones, 56, a prisoner who was convicted of several offenses, including arson, and who holds a doctorate in English literature. Ms. Gordon-Jones wanted books that were often unavailable in prison libraries, and had been reading works by Alan Bennett, Monica Ali and Marcus Aurelius, the judgment said. Frances Crook, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, which campaigns for improved prison conditions, welcomed the ruling. “We are very glad that common sense has now prevailed in time for Christmas, when for three weeks, prisons will be virtually in lockdown,” she said. “During that time, receiving a book from a loved one could literally save a life.” Sadiq Khan, who speaks for the Labour Party on justice issues, said the ban on sending books to prisoners was “always an absurd policy,” an example of “sloppy policy making.” “This is a victory for all those who campaigned against the ban,” he added, “and the government should abandon the ludicrous policy with immediate effect.” In a statement, the Prison Service described the judgment as “surprising.” “There never was a specific ban on books, and the restrictions on parcels have been in existence across most of the prison estate for many years and for very good reason,” the service said. “Prisoners have access to the same public library service as the rest of us and can buy books through the prison shop.” The Prison Service added that while it was “considering how best to fulfill the ruling of the court,” it would not do anything “that would create a new conduit for smuggling drugs and extremist materials into our prisons.”
