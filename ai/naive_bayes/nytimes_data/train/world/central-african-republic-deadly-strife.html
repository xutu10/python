Clashes between Muslim and Christian fighters have left at least 28 people dead, wounded dozens and sent civilians fleeing for safety, a Red Cross official said Thursday. The fighting began Tuesday in the town of Mbrès when a member of a Christian militia was killed by a grenade believed to have been thrown by a group of Muslims, according to a pastor in the town. The violence escalated when Christian fighters counterattacked and members of a Muslim rebel alliance arrived from a nearby town to join the fight. Ahamat Ibrahim Nedjad, a spokesman for the Muslim fighters, confirmed the clashes, but he said his group was attacked first and fought back. Gunfire could still be heard on Thursday, and 70 homes have been burned, said the Red Cross official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.
