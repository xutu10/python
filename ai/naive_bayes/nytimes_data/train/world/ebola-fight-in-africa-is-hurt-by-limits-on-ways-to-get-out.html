Ebola Fight in Africa Is Hurt by Limits on Ways to Get Out
The lack of a reliable evacuation system makes aid missions to West Africa much more dangerous for volunteers, who are thus less likely to go there.

BRUSSELS —  When a French nurse working as a volunteer in West Africa tested positive for  The nurse survived, but according to the aid group that sent her to Liberia and arranged to get her out, Europe’s failure to establish a swift evacuation service for infected medical workers has become a serious hurdle impeding the battle against  “For us, this is a big problem,” said Brice de le Vingne, director of operations for the group, Doctors Without Borders. “We will not be able to convince volunteers to go to these countries to help tackle the epidemic if we don’t have a good evacuation system.” In Brussels, the European Commission has taken a modest step by having its logistics broker, a private German company, engage a French air ambulance service,  The French company, however, has only one plane equipped for Ebola victims and will carry only so-called dry patients — people who have contracted Ebola and have a fever but have not yet developed more serious symptoms like bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea. Dr. Hervé Raffin, the general director of Medic’Air, said the biggest obstacle was a shortage not of aircraft but of pilots willing to fly Ebola patients. He said his company’s usual pilots had all refused because “they think the risk is too high,” adding that he knew of only two pilots in all of Europe who would fly Ebola evacuation missions. Doctors Without Borders itself hired Medic’Air last week to fly an infected Norwegian doctor to Oslo from Sierra Leone, but Mr. de le Vingne worries that private air ambulance companies cannot cope with the number of sick aid workers. “If there are several evacuations like last week, this will not be enough,” he said. Doctors Without Borders says the  “Countries all say: A 25-bed treatment center that the American military is building in Liberia to treat health workers could help relieve some of the strain. While visiting an Ebola treatment unit run by International Medical Corps in Liberia, Gen. Darryl A. Williams, commander of United States Army soldiers operating in Africa, said his forces had no general mandate to evacuate American medical workers who become infected. But he added, “If conditions warrant, we’re not going to turn our back." At a World Bank conference on Friday in Washington, Europe’s senior official for humanitarian aid, Kristalina Georgieva, acknowledged that medical evacuation was an issue that “we have struggled with for quite some time,” expressing frustration over stalled efforts to get governments to work out a shared service. “When you are desperate, turn to the private sector; they will come up with a solution for you,” she said, apparently referring to Medic’Air. “Finally, we have a solution. We have a contract.” Dr. Raffin of Medic’Air, however, said there was no formal contract yet, only a general understanding to help the commission with evacuation flights, which he said would cost between $100,000 and $150,000 per patient, assuming one patient per flight. A spokesman for Ms. Georgieva said the European Commission was also hoping to reach an arrangement soon with  The company, based near Atlanta, has two Gulfstream jets equipped to carry patients with highly infectious diseases like Ebola and is outfitting a third. The planes have flown more than a dozen people infected with Ebola out of West Africa, including the French nurse. Dent Thompson, Phoenix Air’s vice president for operations, said the evacuation of the French nurse had “taken a little bit longer than normal” because it coincided with another evacuation job. Moving a patient, he said, is “the easy part." Decontaminating an aircraft once the patient is dropped off is the hard part, he said. This involves an elaborate 24-hour process of treatment with chemicals and the removal and burning of seatbelts, lights and anything else that might have come into contact with the sick passenger. “It is a nasty, nasty disease and ultracontagious,” he said of Ebola. The company’s pilots and mechanics initially balked, Mr. Thompson said, but “now understand that if all the protocols are followed to the letter, the risks are very limited.” Still, around one-third of the company’s 70 pilots will not fly Ebola patients, he said. Mr. de le Vingne said that Phoenix Air had done a “very good job” evacuating Ebola patients from West Africa, but that the company was too far away and was overextended. Already under contract with the State Department, Phoenix Air said it could help foreign citizens only if it got a request from the State Department to do so and if it was available. Claus Sorensen, director general of the European bloc’s humanitarian aid department in Brussels, acknowledged that evacuation flights were a serious issue because doctors and nurses “are reluctant to go when they know they can’t get out.” But he added: “We don’t have a European air force. We need to use the air forces of individual member states.” The limited availability of evacuation flights sharply increases lethal risks to foreign medical workers who are unable to be swiftly transferred to hospitals in Europe or the United States where experimental drugs and modern facilities raise the chances of survival. Linda McAvan, head of the European Parliament’s development committee, said the problem would only become more acute as new treatment centers opened. In addition to the one to treat medical workers, 17 other centers are being constructed by the American military in Liberia, and each one is likely to need staff members from abroad. Last month, she urged the European Union’s departing foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, to plead for action on evacuation measures. The European Parliament also passed a resolution that called on the bloc’s 28 member states “to establish dedicated air bridges” to move medical teams into West Africa and “to provide medical evacuation.” The appeals, however, have done little to end weeks of inconclusive haggling between governments and Brussels. “I am not a big expert on how the European Union functions,” Mr. de le Vingne said, “but I find it amazing that everyone we talk to says that we are right, that there is enough money, but nothing is happening.” As a result, he said, new Doctors Without Borders volunteers are advised that “we don’t have a 100 percent guarantee that we can evacuate you, but we will do our best.” Mr. Thompson of Phoenix Air said his company would welcome an evacuation service set up by Europe because “the more transport options there are, the better.” But he added: “It is not as easy as it sounds. You don’t just set up a plastic tent inside an airplane.”
