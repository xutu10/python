NEW DELHI — The Obama administration on Friday nominated Richard R. Verma to become the next ambassador to India, just days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India is expected to fly to the United States. Mr. Verma, a partner in the influential law firm of Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, served as assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs from 2009 to 2011. Mr. Verma’s selection had been rumored for months. He joins a long list of Indian-Americans who work on Indian affairs at the State Department.
