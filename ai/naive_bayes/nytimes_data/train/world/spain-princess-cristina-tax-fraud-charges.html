Spanish Court Upholds Tax Fraud Charges Against Princess Cristina
The court agreed to drop the more serious money laundering charges that were also filed against her.

MADRID — A Spanish court on Friday upheld tax fraud charges against Princess Cristina, who has been entangled in a corruption case centered on whether her husband and his business associates embezzled millions of euros in public funds earmarked for sports events. While leaving the tax charges intact, the High Court of Palma, on the Mediterranean island of Majorca, agreed to drop the more serious money laundering charges that were also filed against her in June, making it possible that the princess could settle the case by paying back taxes. The court’s decision dashed the royal household’s hopes of containing the damage solely to the reputation of Cristina’s husband, Iñaki Urdangarin. Mr. Urdangarin has been under investigation for years, caught up in a fraud scandal that coincides with several other political corruption cases that have shaken the institutional foundations of Spain. The investigation has already lasted three years, but it now comes after Cristina’s brother  Both Cristina and her husband have denied wrongdoing in previous court appearances. The investigation has been led by José Castro, a judge based in Palma. He has been looking into whether Mr. Urdangarin used his royal credentials to secure inflated sports contracts from regional politicians for a foundation that he presided over, before then siphoning off millions of euros from the contract fees toward other companies and offshore accounts that he and his business associates controlled. In June, Judge Castro charged 16 people, including Mr. Urdangarin and his wife; Diego Torres, a former business associate; and several officials from the regional governments of the Balearic Islands and Valencia, which awarded the suspicious sports contracts. No date has yet been set for the trial. The royal household has long distanced itself from Mr. Urdangarin, who has denied that his wife and other members of the royal family had any direct involvement in the management of his foundation, the Nóos Institute. Mr. Urdangarin became duke of Palma in 1997 upon marrying Cristina.
