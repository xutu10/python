Pro-Democracy Movement’s Vote in Hong Kong Abruptly Called Off
The cancellation of the balloting, which had been intended as a display of unity, exposed tensions over how to sustain the protests.

HONG KONG — Organizers of a planned vote among  Student leaders and organizers of Occupy Central With Love and Peace, the group that laid the groundwork for a civil disobedience campaign for democracy, had urged people to vote at protest sites on Sunday and Monday as a way of registering their support for student negotiators seeking political concessions from the government. But hours before the balloting was due to start on Sunday night, organizers announced it was off and apologized. They said there was too much disagreement over the wording and value of the vote. “We acknowledge that there was not enough consultation with the public,” they said in an emailed statement. At a news conference, some organizers were contrite, while others cast their surprise move in the best possible light. “It won’t affect the morale of this movement,” said Alex Chow Yong Kang, the secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students. “This decision can rebuild the trust between us and the protesters. Protesters have all along shared a single goal; it’s just that they may have different views about the execution.” But even before the cancellation, the vote, intended as a display of unity, had brought into focus tensions among protesters over how to hone their broadly shared aspirations into durable demands and strategies. Such strains could deepen as the protesters face fatigue in their own ranks and the refusal of the Hong Kong government and Chinese Communist Party leaders to make the major concessions demanded by demonstrators, said  “The question becomes: What’s the endgame?” he said in a telephone interview from Toronto, where he was visiting. “Once they didn’t pull out earlier and declare victory, they needed something from the government to be able to declare victory. Now they need to find some endgame, and I think that they’re not going to find it without compromise.” Although supporters of the protests were unlikely to disagree with the two wordy propositions on the canceled ballot, some feared the vote could pave the way for unacceptable compromise or premature withdrawal from the street occupations in three parts of the city. Benny Tai, an associate professor of law who is a co-founder of Occupy Central, earlier denied that intention and said he had no power over deciding when protesters left the streets. Occupy Central had initially envisioned a much smaller, briefer protest in Central, the main financial district of Hong Kong. At a news conference on Saturday, Mr. Tai said that he could not say how to sustain the protests into a second month. “You can just go down to the plaza and ask the protesters who have stationed there for so many days, how long do they prepare to stay. I think you can get a good answer.” But protesters have voiced a range of opinions on the future of their grass-roots movement. Some have wavered from the demand that voters be allowed to put forward candidates for chief executive without vetting from Beijing, while others said that demand, called civic nomination, could not be weakened. The main protest sites at Admiralty, an area on the south side of Victoria Harbor, and Mong Kok, on the north side, continue to be vibrant, carnival-like gatherings with speeches, performances and art, as well as classroom areas for students. But participants said sustaining the protests was becoming harder, and some said they would accept compromise short of their ultimate demands for free elections. “It’s about a month now since the whole thing began, and I think the students are tired, and we need a direction for what to do next,” said Steven Chan, a commercial bank worker who said he had regularly come to Admiralty, close to the government offices, where the street occupations began Sept. 28. “I think politics is a negotiation,” he said, seated outside one of the hundreds of tents occupied by protesters. “Even if there is no civic nomination, there are still ways for Beijing to allow at least one voice from the people in the election” for chief executive, he said. But many other protesters remain adamantly committed to civic nomination, even though the Chinese government has said the idea is unlawful and politically intolerable. “I certainly think we need to stay here until we get a real, satisfactory reply on civic nomination,” said Natasha Liang, an 18-year-old high school student at the Admiralty protest site. “Many people feel our government is using a strategy of letting us stay here but ignoring our demands. So we have to stay even longer.” At Mong Kok, student leaders have been less of a force, and the sit-ins have drawn in white-collar and blue-collar workers, many of them more distrustful of the established protest groups and democratic lawmakers in the city’s Legislative Council. Posters mocking the vote and Mr. Tai festooned Mong Kok and Admiralty in recent days, accusing him of highhandedly ignoring the views of grass-roots supporters of the protests. “Our demand is very clear: We want civic nomination,” said Wong Yeung-tat, a leader of Civic Passion, a brashly populist group opposed to mainland Chinese influence in Hong Kong. Mr. Wong and Civic Passion have become a major force in the Mong Kok protest camp. “This movement is very idealist,” said Mr. Wong, “and it’s worth doing because it is idealistic.”
