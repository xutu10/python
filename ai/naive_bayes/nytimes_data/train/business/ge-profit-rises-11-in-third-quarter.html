Its operating earnings from continuing operations, which exclude the impact from operations sold off or closed down, per share rose 6 percent, to 38 cents a share. That was slightly ahead of the average estimate of securities analysts of 37 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. G.E.'s revenue across the corporation rose 1 percent, to $36.2 billion, from $35.7 billion last year. That was below the $36.8 billion forecast by Wall Street analysts.

With oil prices falling, spending plans for heavy equipment in the  Across its industrial lines, G.E. has streamlined its operations to reduce expenses, analysts say. If sales of new industrial equipment lag, the company, will rely on pulling more profit from its $250 billion backlog of orders for equipment and services, analysts note. A crucial tactic in the G.E. game plan, said Brian K. Langenberg, an independent analyst, is to “take cost out to capture higher profit margins in their huge backlog of business.”
