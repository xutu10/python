What Bourbon Producers Can Teach the Oil Industry 
In both cases, the long period between investment in and availability of a finished product means supply and demand can be badly misaligned.

The market for crude oil is in veritable free fall. The price of a barrel has dropped 30 percent since June, and the ripples have only begun, with analysts warning of everything from bankruptcies of Texas oil fields to economic troubles in big oil-producing nations like Venezuela and Nigeria. If oil prices stay low or keep falling, it will be one of the most important trends shaping the world economy in 2015, which raises the question: Why is this happening? To answer that, it is useful to look at the market for another fluid that is stored in barrels, one that is less economically consequential but quite a bit more tasty: bourbon. As it turns out, oil producers from Dallas to Abu Dhabi could learn a few things from the Kentucky distilleries that turn out nectarlike whiskeys. What oil and bourbon have in common are the long time lags between investment in a new supply and availability of the finished product. With bourbon, that’s because a distiller must keep the good stuff in barrels for seven, 10, or even 20 years before it’s ready to drink. With oil, it’s because investment in new drilling projects is a slow-moving affair, frequently involving years of complex engineering and construction before the crude starts to flow. The result for both is that supply is basically fixed in the short run. The amount of oil available in the near future is determined by investment decisions that oil producers made years ago. This creates big swings in prices over long time horizons that have broad effects on everything from the cars we drive to the politicians who win office. The current sell-off in oil, for example, has its roots in actions taken in the middle of the last decade. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, oil was cheap — under $20 a barrel at the end of 2001. Those low prices left oil producers with little incentive to invest in drilling. Global investment in new production was only about $200 billion in 2004, according to estimates by an energy research firm, I.H.S. Herold. But early this century, economic growth in emerging nations was stronger than oil producers had predicted, and the demand for energy soared. Years of underinvestment because of low prices started to become a problem. By 2008, the price of oil topped $140 a barrel, and investment approached $500 billion. Now, the world finds itself living under the opposite circumstances. The increase in exploration that began in the last decade is starting to pay off in a big way, including a boom in the United States. After reaching five million barrels of oil a day in 2008, domestic crude output was up to 7.5 million in 2013 and is still rising. Meanwhile, the gaudy growth rates in China and other emerging markets of the middle of the last decade have given way to slower expansion, and the giant economies of Europe, Japan and the United States have underperformed after years of crisis. “We’re not going to see a synchronized global economic boom anytime soon,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of I.H.S. and author of “The Quest,” a book about the global oil market. “These cycles of investment and lumpiness of new supplies coming on, and of market reactions and economic cycles, are all at work. What’s the adjustment mechanism? It’s price.” But the volatility of the last decade in the price of oil comes at a cost. Entirely different economic arrangements make sense when oil is $70 a barrel and when it is $140. People want to buy different cars; airlines fly different routes at different prices; investment in alternative energy sources becomes more or less viable; oil-producing countries can be flush or starving. In other words, these cycles in oil prices are drastic, and can have real consequences in making it harder for businesses and societies to make long-term decisions. It can work against the interests of the oil producers themselves; the higher prices get, the more consumers and businesses have incentive to invest in efficiency and alternative energy sources. Which brings us back to the bourbon market. What is happening now in the market for high-quality bourbon is basically the opposite of what is happening with oil (or is parallel to what was happening with oil in 2007 and 2008). Over the last decade, bourbon has become the buzzy distilled spirit, as people who once favored vodka have discovered the appeal of bourbon brands like  But just as oil producers can’t turn the spigot on new oil supplies overnight, the years that bourbon must spend in barrels have left producers behind the curve in keeping up with demand. “In 2002 we would have been making Buffalo Trace to be sold in 2011,” said Mark Brown, the chief executive of  In the oil market, a global commodity with countless buyers and sellers, price is the only adjustment mechanism. But bourbon makers are, in many cases, trying to avoid raising their prices much. “We’ve been adamant about not raising our prices to our distributors much beyond the cost of goods and inflation,” Mr. Brown said. “The reason for that is very simple. We’re in this business for the long term. Just because bourbon is hot right now doesn’t change our way of thinking to say let’s take advantage of the situation.” Buffalo Trace and other bourbon makers try to carefully allocate their product to distributors around the country at what is, effectively, slightly below the  But the bet the bourbon industry is making is that there is more money to be made in the long run by cultivating a new generation of bourbon drinkers among young adults, and by building loyalty among customers in all corners of the United States, and eventually the world. It’s not quite what Economics 101 would tell you to do, but it may be the right recipe for eliminating the boom-and-bust cycle that has made the oil business so volatile.
