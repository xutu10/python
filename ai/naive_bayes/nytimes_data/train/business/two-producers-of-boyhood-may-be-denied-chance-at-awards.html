Two Producers of ‘Boyhood’ May Be Denied Chance at Awards
While credited in the film, the two — John Sloss and Jonathan Sehring — have been excluded by the Producers Guild.

LOS ANGELES — Some prospective awards-night glory may elude two producers of one of the year’s most distinctive films — “Boyhood,” by the director Richard Linklater — because of stringent rules governing the assignment of credits by the Producers Guild of America, a person briefed on the situation said on Friday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity The two producers who may be affected are John Sloss, a prominent indie film producer and lawyer, and Jonathan Sehring, the president of IFC Films, which financed and is distributing “Boyhood.” While Mr. Sloss and Mr. Sehring are among four credited producers on the movie, they were barred from consideration for a Producers Guild award. The Wrap, an entertainment and media news site,  The two producers eligible for the Producers Guild award are Mr. Linklater and Cathleen Sutherland. The guild has long fought to make the term producer a designation for a specific filmmaking craft, rather than a catchall for those who helped a movie toward production. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences generally, but not always, lines up with the guild guidelines in assigning producer credits for Oscar purposes. “Boyhood” is unusual in that Mr. Linklater, its writer and director, began shooting the film in 2002. The movie, which follows the growth of a boy played by Ellar Coltrane, received financial and other support from Mr. Sloss and Mr. Sehring. In a statement, Mr. Sloss and Mr. Sehring said: "Boyhood’ was made in a unique and unconventional way and our job was to ensure that Rick had the creative freedom” to make his atypical film. “We’re thrilled that audiences have embraced this labor of love,” they added. Tightened rules governing the assignment of producers credits for awards purposes followed a controversy in 1999, when Harvey Weinstein, whose Miramax Films was a backer of “Shakespeare in Love,” was one of five credited producers who accepted its best picture Oscar. The new rules made it more difficult for a financier to claim awards credit, and gave considerable weight to those who were present on a film set. A spokeswoman for the producers guild did not immediately respond to a query. The producers guild will present its annual awards on Jan. 24, 2015. The Oscar ceremony follows on Feb. 22.
