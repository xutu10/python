Snus and Needle Exchange
A reader responds to “A Lesser Warning? Maybe” (Nov. 30).

To the Editor: Re “ Matt Richtel and David Jolly do a thorough job canvassing the issue of snus as tobacco harm reduction. But in looking for an analogy, they resurrect the old canard that providing sterile syringes through needle exchange programs, “while preventing the spread of H.I.V., potentially encourages drug use.” There is not now nor has there ever been evidence that needle exchange increases drug use or encourages nonusers to start using. This casual error is important, because in spite of considerable evidence that needle exchange prevents H.I.V., significant legal barriers to syringe exchange remain in nearly half the states of the union, and Congress still prohibits the use of federal funds for these lifesaving programs.
