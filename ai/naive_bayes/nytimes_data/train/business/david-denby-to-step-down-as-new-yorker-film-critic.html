David Denby, a film critic for  Mr. Denby, who had previously been a film critic at New York magazine, will contribute “longer critic-at-large pieces to the magazine” on films, books and other topics, said Natalie Raabe, a spokeswoman for The New Yorker. Anthony Lane, who had long shared the film criticism pages with Mr. Denby, will be the magazine’s sole film critic, and Richard Brody will cover film online. “The screening rooms will be less merry without him, the reassuring sound of him opening his thermos for a sip of soup to be heard no more,” James Wolcott, a columnist for Vanity Fair, wrote on Twitter on Saturday. John Lahr, a New Yorker staff writer who revealed the news of Mr. Denby’s change of roles in a Twitter post, described him as “a masterly film critic and cohort.” Mr. Lahr was the magazine’s chief theater critic until about two years ago, but is now a staff writer. In addition to his magazine work, Mr. Denby has written several books, including “Snark,” which analyzes the current cultural tone, and “American Sucker,” an account of his investing misadventures in early 2000 during the dot-com boom. The news came as Condé Nast, the media company that owns The New Yorker as well as Vanity Fair and Vogue among other high-profile titles, completes a staff reduction across the board.
