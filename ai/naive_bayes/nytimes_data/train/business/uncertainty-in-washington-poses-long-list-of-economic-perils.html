Uncertainty in Washington Poses Long List of Economic Perils 
As another round of fiscal brinkmanship looms with Republican control of Congress, the impact on tax policy, government programs and the overall economy could be severe.

WASHINGTON —  As House Republicans mull another round of fiscal brinkmanship with President Obama, a dark cloud is threatening to return to otherwise clearing economic skies: fiscal and political uncertainty. Republican leaders moved Tuesday to finesse their way around another government shutdown next week, but the fiscal gantlet extends well beyond Dec. 11, when the current stopgap spending law that funds much of the federal government expires. Absent congressional action, a host of business and personal tax breaks expires on Jan. 1. The government’s borrowing limit is reinstated on March 16, although the government might not actually hit the ceiling until August. On March 28, unless lawmakers act, physician reimbursements from  “I see a lot of potential for Republicans to use all these fiscal speed bumps as leverage points,” said Joel Prakken, a co-founder of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm that calculated that previous fiscal fights, combined with tighter budgets, shaved as much as 1 percentage point off economic growth, a big sum considering that growth has averaged an annual rate of 2.15 percent since Republicans took control of the House in 2011. Washington brinkmanship is returning just as federal, state and local governments finally cease to be a drag on the economy through spending cuts and, in some cases, tax increases. Federal spending rose nearly 10 percent in July, August and September, mainly for the military, after falling 1 percent the quarter before, according to the federal “Investors should prepare for a return of this type of behavior and volatility in Washington in 2015 as governing-by-crisis appears ready to return,” Chris Krueger, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, warned clients on Tuesday. The  “From a businessman’s standpoint, uncertainty in general just has a huge impact in how you think of the future, how you plan for capital investment and how you plan for hiring,” said Randall L. Stephenson, chairman of AT&T; and of the Business Roundtable. “Just go down the long list. There’s a wide range of possible outcomes on policy, so you have to come to a more conservative approach to planning.” Congressional leaders moved to clear up some uncertainty Tuesday, but in so doing, they may merely create more. House Republican leaders would like to pass a measure funding the government through Sept. 30, but keeping the Homeland Security office open only for short bursts to pressure the president over his executive action deferring deportation of illegal immigrants. Most House Republicans appeared ready to go along with this half measure, but conservative groups opposed the strategy as not confrontational enough on issues like the Environmental Protection Agency’s climate change regulations or the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s antidiscrimination efforts. Anti-immigration conservatives made it clear they would keep opposing the undocumented-worker executive order. “This is the time to fight, this is the ground to fight on, and I’m a little bit amazed that that isn’t more clear to more people,” declared Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa. Negotiators have all but given up culling the government’s growing list of temporary tax measures, making some permanent and jettisoning the most egregious tax giveaways. Instead, the House will vote Wednesday on a measure to restore almost all the tax breaks that expired last year for one year retroactively. That would allow taxpayers to claim them on their 2014 tax returns while forcing Congress to grapple with the issue again early next year. “Short of not passing anything at all, this is probably the worst of all possible worlds,” said Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah and the incoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “Rather than the certainty that would come with making some of the more prominent individual and business tax extenders permanent, families, individuals, and businesses will have to once again put long-term plans on hold in hopes that Congress can get its act together next time around.” Meantime, 45 House Republicans pleaded with their leaders to bring to a vote a multiyear extension of federal terrorism risk insurance, which is set to expire this month. The issue is vital to developers in Lower Manhattan and elsewhere, who cannot get large building projects insured in the private sector without a government backstop. Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and an opponent of the seven-year terrorism insurance bill passed 93-4 by the Senate, said no, blaming Senate Democrats for not agreeing with his position. “If Senate Democrats continue to insist on their ‘my way or the highway’ approach, I fear a long-term reauthorization may have to wait until the next Congress,” he said. The price of such shenanigans is high. Macroeconomic Advisers’  Some economists say the overall impact may be overblown. As Washington nears another showdown, stock prices tend to sag and some bonds get dumped in a fire sale, said Alec Phillips, managing director for United States economic research at Goldman Sachs. Then they snap back postcrisis. Leaders in neither party wanted to defend the contortions to come. “The American people certainly do not want to face another year being governed by crisis,” warned Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader until next month. “No one wants the kind of cliffhanger fights we’ve had again and again in years past.”
