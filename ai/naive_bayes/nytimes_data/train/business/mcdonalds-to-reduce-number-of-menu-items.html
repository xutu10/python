McDonald’s is planning to trim its menu, review its cooking methods and maybe even get rid of some ingredients to change perceptions that it serves junk food. Mike Andres, McDonald’s USA president, said the 100 items the chain added to its menu over the last decade had made the menu too complicated. Starting next month, McDonald’s will cut eight items from the menu and reduce the number of Extra Value Meals to 11 from 16. But the burger chain did not say which items would be likely to go. Mr. Andres also said the company was looking at cooking procedures to enhance the appeal of its food, as well as reducing the number of ingredients. McDonald’s restaurants go through supplies quickly, he noted, making any transition relatively easy. “Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?” he said. “We probably don’t.”
