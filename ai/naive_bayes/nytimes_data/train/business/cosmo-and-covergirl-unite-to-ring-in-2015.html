Cosmopolitan magazine and the CoverGirl  Cosmopolitan and CoverGirl are taking over the sponsorship from Nivea, the skin care brand owned by Beiersdorf that sponsored the event for the last four years. It is estimated that the pair is paying a bit more than $2 million for the sponsorship, which comes with perks that extend well beyond distributing colorful hats and balloons festooned with brand logos to the throngs gathered to usher in 2015.

That led the magazine to propose the joint sponsorship to CoverGirl, which is introducing 36 moisturizing lipsticks under the Colorlicious moniker, in shades like Bombshell Pink and Delicious Plum.

So are so many other advertisers. Don’t get me in trouble now. We love Revlon.
