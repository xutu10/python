F.C.C. Appears Poised to Loosen N.F.L.’s Blackout Rule, Despite League’s Protests
If the commission, which is expected to vote on the rule on Tuesday, strikes it down, cable and satellite providers could show games even if they are not sold out.

WASHINGTON —  For decades, football fans in various markets wondered whether, come Sunday, they would be able to watch their lamentable but beloved team on television. If tickets to that week’s game were not sold out, the National Football League could keep the game off television in the local market as a way to protect gate receipts. But the Federal Communications Commission appears ready to loosen some of those restrictions on Tuesday, allowing cable and satellite providers to show the game regardless of the number of tickets sold — and upsetting the N.F.L. in the process. Ending the F.C.C.’s so-called blackout rule, now nearly 40 years old, would allow cable and satellite companies to get around league rules that call for a team’s game to be blacked out on the local broadcast channel if the game is not sold out. The league rule would remain in effect, however, so it remains unclear how far-reaching the effect of an F.C.C. repeal would be. If a cable provider wants to show a game blacked out on the local broadcast channel — for example, if a Houston cable provider wants to show the local broadcast from Denver — it will require permissions that might be hard to come by. When the N.F.L. rule was first put into effect, ticket sales were a much bigger contributor to a team’s overall income than they are today. Some markets, like Houston, regularly had blackouts. Now, a majority of teams’ revenue comes from television rights, and barely a handful of games are blacked out each season, or even threatened with a blackout. In 2013, two of the N.F.L.’s 256 regular-season games were blacked out. In 2011, 16 games were blacked out locally, all of them happening in one of four cities: Buffalo, Cincinnati, San Diego and Tampa Bay. Because of the growth of the league, the F.C.C. says that the blackout rule “has become outdated.” Repealing it, the commission says, would eliminate unnecessary regulation and leave the rules “to private solutions negotiated by the interested parties.” The commission is expected to vote on the proposed change on Tuesday. Although the rule is applicable to all sports leagues, it almost exclusively affects the N.F.L., in part because football is the only one of the four major leagues that negotiates its television contracts as a group. In baseball, basketball and hockey, each team negotiates its own contracts for local television coverage. The N.F.L. nevertheless is fighting desperately to keep the F.C.C. rule intact, saying that it actually increases the availability of games on broadcast television. “By ensuring that televising games will not reduce live attendance, the sports blackout rule encourages sports leagues to reach deals with broadcast networks,” the N.F.L. wrote in its pleadings to the commission. If cable and satellite carriers were able to get around the league’s blackout policy, the league said, “the eventual result likely would be a decrease in the amount of professional sports on broadcast television.” Advocates for repealing the F.C.C. rule, including the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, the cable industry group, say the N.F.L.’s argument has major holes. Few games are blacked out, they say, and the N.F.L. could easily take measures like lowering ticket prices if sales are sluggish, much like hotels and airlines do with unsold rooms and seats. The advocates for repeal calculated that the threat of blackouts increased league attendance by about 41,000 fans in 2012, or one-quarter of 1 percent. Many fans stay away because of high ticket prices, they argue, and in many cases they have already contributed to the local team through taxes subsidizing its stadium. Supporting the N.F.L. is the National Association of Broadcasters, which points out that football is the only major team sport whose regular season games are televised mostly on free broadcast stations. Cable system operators could reap rewards for importing a blacked-out game’s broadcast and selling local advertising spots. But that retransmission would require the permission of the remote station broadcasting the game, which might be reluctant to anger the N.F.L. or might have other contractual restrictions to prevent it from agreeing. People who do not pay for cable would still be unable to watch. That loss of control would lead broadcasters to pay less for television rights, making contracts with pay-television channels more lucrative for teams and making it harder for many Americans, particularly low-income fans, to view their team. In any case, the N.F.L. faces long odds in protecting the blackout rule. Both Republican commissioners and Tom Wheeler, the commission’s chairman, already have voiced their support for removing what they call an unnecessary regulation.
