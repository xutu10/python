Daimler Sets Aside $748 Million Over E.U. Inquiry Into Truck Makers
The provision suggested that a price-fixing investigation by the European Commission was gathering pace, years after the first raids were carried out.

FRANKFURT — A European Union investigation into possible price fixing by Europe’s largest truck manufacturers appeared to be gathering momentum on Thursday after Daimler of Germany said it had set aside 600 million euros to cover possible costs resulting from the inquiry. Daimler, based in Stuttgart, said it had decided to set aside that amount, the equivalent of $748 million, after having a chance to examine the documents on which the  The commission, the European Union’s antitrust regulator, said in November that it had told a number of truck makers that it suspected them of colluding on prices and operating a cartel. Volvo Group, a Swedish truck maker that is separate from the maker of Volvo cars, said last month that it would set aside €400 million in connection with the case. The commission did not name the truck makers it suspected of price fixing, but several have confirmed they are targets of the inquiry. In addition to Daimler, they include MAN of Germany and Scania of Sweden, both controlled by  Spokesmen for MAN, Scania and CNH declined to comment on Thursday. Daimler said the provisions would affect its fourth-quarter profit, but added that it was sticking to previous forecasts that earnings for the year would increase significantly from 2013. The investigation dates from 2011, when the European Commission said it had conducted “unannounced inspections” of the offices of truck makers on suspicion they had violated antitrust laws. The truck market was then in a slump, but sales have been recovering. In October, sales of new trucks and buses in the European Union rose 10.8 percent from a year earlier, to 177,000 vehicles, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. It was the 14th monthly sales increase in a row. Daimler makes trucks and vans under the Mercedes-Benz, Freightliner and Fuso brand names. Daimler’s profit from truck sales rose 13 percent in the third quarter to €588 million. Cartel investigations tend to proceed slowly, and Carolina Luna Gordo, a spokeswoman for the commission, said she could not predict when the proceedings involving the truck makers might conclude.
