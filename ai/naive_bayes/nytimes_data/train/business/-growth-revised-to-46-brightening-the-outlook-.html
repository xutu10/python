WASHINGTON —  The bounce-back in the United States’ economy last quarter from a dismal winter was even faster than previously thought, a sign that growth will most likely remain solid for rest of the year. The economy as measured by  The upward revision reflected stronger-than-expected business investment and exports last quarter. The healthy second-quarter growth was a sharp rebound from the January-March quarter, when the economy shrank at a 2.1-percent rate during a brutal winter that idled factories and kept consumers at home. As the third quarter nears an end on Sept. 30, economists envision a strengthening economy through the end of 2014 and into 2015. Many think the economy is growing in the current July-September quarter at a rate of around 3 percent. Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, is more optimistic than most. He said a brighter outlook for business investment spending and other good economic reports had led him to revise his G.D.P. forecast to 3.2 percent growth for the July-September period, up from 2.8 percent earlier. “The American economy is firing on virtually all cylinders and cruising at a decidedly stronger rate than in recent years,” Mr. Guatieri said. Friday’s report on G.D.P. — the economy’s total output of goods and services — was the government’s third and final estimate for the second quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate, up from 1.2 percent growth in the first quarter. Analysts have sketched a much brighter outlook for 2015. Economists at JPMorgan Chase predict growth of 3 percent next year.
