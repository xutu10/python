Dr. Nancy Snyderman, NBC’s chief medical correspondent, will return to television with an appearance on the “Today” show Wednesday morning. The appearance will bring to an end what had been an extended absence by Dr. Snyderman, who returned from covering the Ebola outbreak in Liberia and drew a chorus of criticism for breaking a self-imposed quarantine. NBC News would not officially confirm Dr. Snyderman was returning to work, but an executive with knowledge of her planned report on Wednesday said her return would involve both a taped piece about depression as well as a conversation with one of the show’s anchors, probably Matt Lauer. Dr. Snyderman is expected to use that conversation to address the actions that made news in October, when she was seen in public in New Jersey just days after promising to quarantine herself for 21 days. She had been working with a photographer, Ashoka Mukpo, who contracted Ebola. Dr. Snyderman issued a statement at the time, saying that she was “deeply sorry for the concerns this episode caused.”
