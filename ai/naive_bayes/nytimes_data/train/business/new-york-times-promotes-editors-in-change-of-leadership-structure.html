New York Times Promotes Editors, in Change of Leadership Structure

The executive editor of The New York Times announced broad changes to the newspaper’s leadership Wednesday, replacing titles that had been used for decades and promoting several senior editors. The editor, Dean Baquet, will retire the job of managing editor, traditionally the second-most senior newsroom position at The Times, and a job he once held, and promote four senior editors — Susan Chira, Janet Elder, Matt Purdy and Ian Fisher — to the new title of deputy executive editor, he wrote in a memo to the staff on Wednesday. A fifth editor, Tom Bodkin, will be given the title of creative director, a position equal to the four deputy executive editors. The changes are intended to make the masthead more nimble and responsive, and strategic in dealing with a shifting industry, Mr. Baquet said. The masthead titles, he said, which have traditionally been seen as something of a coronation, will now be more fluid. “I anticipate people moving on and off the masthead as our needs evolve,” Mr. Baquet said, “and it is important that these moves not be seen as measures of who is up and who is down, but rather as appointments aimed at keeping our journalism and our entire operation as vibrant as possible.” Each deputy executive editor will have a distinct area of responsibility. Ms. Chira, 56, will lead the news report, Mr. Baquet said. Ms. Chira was made an assistant managing editor in 2011, after 30 years at The Times. She had previously been a Tokyo correspondent, the editor of the paper’s Week in Review section and its foreign editor. Ms. Elder, 58, will manage talent, operations and budget. She was appointed a deputy managing editor in late 2013, with similar responsibilities, after a long career at The Times that included a stint running its polling operation. Mr. Purdy, 58, will run investigations and enterprise coverage. He had been an assistant managing editor, overseeing investigative articles across the newspaper, since July 2013. He was investigations editor for nine years before that, helping that department win five Pulitzer Prizes during his tenure. He came to The Times from The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1993. Mr. Fisher, 48, will oversee digital operations. He became an assistant managing editor in January 2013, overseeing the integration of the digital and print sides of the newspaper. He had previously been a deputy foreign editor and a foreign correspondent. Mr. Baquet also announced the promotion of Mr. Bodkin, a deputy managing editor and the paper’s longtime head of design. In addition, Lawrence Ingrassia, 62, a deputy managing editor and the paper’s former Business Day editor, will retire at the end of the year. Speaking about Mr. Ingrassia, who also led the recent transformation of The International New York Times, Mr. Baquet said: “Besides leading some of our best coverage, he brought a generation of young reporters to The Times who have made significant contributions to every aspect of our report.” Three other editors received promotions. Joseph Kahn, who oversees the paper’s international coverage, will join the masthead, becoming assistant editor for international. Steve Duenes, the paper’s graphics director, will also join the masthead, as an assistant editor. And Clifford J. Levy, who runs the mobile news app NYT Now, has been promoted to associate editor. Mr. Baquet was named executive editor of The Times in May, replacing Jill Abramson, who was dismissed from the paper’s top editorial position after less than three years in the job. He said that he was expanding his leadership team because “we have too much work to do to have all the decisions made by a couple of editors in a corner office.” He added: “Our goals are to get more readers, to continue to stretch the boundaries of storytelling in a mobile world that allows us to do things we never imagined, to take on ever larger targets with our investigative reporting, and to expand our ability to cover a world in turmoil.”
