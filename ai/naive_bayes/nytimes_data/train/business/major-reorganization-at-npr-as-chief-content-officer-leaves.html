NPR is losing a chief content officer and gaining a chief operating officer as part of a major reorganization of the media organization  Kinsey Wilson, NPR’s chief content officer and the architect of its digital strategy over the last six years, will leave at the end of the week and will not be replaced, NPR said Monday. In addition to overseeing new programs like the midday show “Here and Now,” Mr. Wilson led the development of the NPR One mobile app, which was introduced in July. He also put together a deal making NPR the first news service on Apple’s iTunes Radio. Those who felt NPR in the past had been caught flat-footed as its audience migrated to mobile and digital platforms widely admired Mr. Wilson’s initiatives. However, some managers at NPR’s local member radio stations have been unhappy, concerned that donations will fall if listeners bypass them to get their favorite shows. In a telephone interview, Mr. Mohn praised Mr. Wilson’s digital strategy and said, “We are going to continue to move in that direction.” But the platform listeners use “doesn’t mean anything if the content is not the best it can be,” he said, adding that “we are going to focus on making it that way.” Mr. Wilson was not available to comment, an NPR spokeswoman said. Digital operations will now report to Loren Mayor, who had been senior vice president of strategy and was promoted to the new chief operating officer position. Ms. Mayor will be charged with running NPR’s daily operations. Mr. Mohn praised her recent work developing NPR’s first strategic plan in a decade and helping put in place a balanced budget, the company’s first after several years of multi-million-dollar losses. As a result of Mr. Mohn’s intention to focus his own activities on content, fund-raising, local station relations and audience development, NPR’s news operations will now report directly to Mr. Mohn, although he will not be involved in daily editorial decisions. “Over half of our employees are journalists,” he said, adding that he wanted to send a strong signal “that we are first and foremost a news organization.” NPR is searching for a new head of news, after Margaret Low Smith  The chief marketing officer, Emma Carrasco, will now oversee entertainment programs such as “Wait Wait … Don’t Tell Me!” NPR will also increasingly cross-promote among shows. Last month, Mr. Mohn challenged local stations to improve the ratings of its “Morning Edition” newsmagazine by 10 percent in six months using more aggressive promotion throughout the day.
