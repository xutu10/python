David Gregory to Join Katie Couric for Election Special on Yahoo
It is expected to be the first on-air appearance for Mr. Gregory since he was replaced as host of NBC’s “Meet The Press” in August.

David Gregory Mr. Gregory has not formally joined Yahoo, the company said, but will be a guest with Ms. Couric, the political journalists Matt Bai and Mike Allen and the political advocate Grover Norquist among others for an election special on Nov. 4. Mr. Gregory said by email that he was not immediately available to comment on the appearance and whether it might mean a return to television in some capacity. Since his departure from the high-profile “Meet the Press” role, he has signed up with a public speaking agency, Leading Authorities, and has begun writing a book about his Jewish faith, according to his biography at American University, where he is a journalist in residence. He has also moderated at least one panel discussion. Mr. Gregory was replaced, after 20 years at the network, with an NBC colleague, Chuck Todd, formerly a White House correspondent, after months of speculation about his future amid a consistent decline in viewers. “The time had come for this to happen,” the president of NBC News, Deborah Turness, said in August. She had tried to reshape the program, but the “numbers just didn’t move,” she said, speaking of the ratings. In a tweet after his dismissal, Mr. Gregory said he would leave NBC as he arrived, “humbled and grateful.”
