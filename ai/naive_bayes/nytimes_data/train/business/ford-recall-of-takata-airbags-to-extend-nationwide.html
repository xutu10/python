Ford Recall of Takata Airbags to Extend Nationwide
Ford said it was expanding the recall nationwide — and globally — adding another 447,000 vehicles to the list.

WASHINGTON —  Under pressure from regulators, Ford Motor is expanding nationwide the recall of vehicles with airbags manufactured by the Japanese supplier Takata, the automaker said on Thursday. Ford had previously recalled about 55,000 Mustang and GT models to replace driver’s-side Takata airbags where the inflater can explode, sending metal shards flying into the passenger cabin. That recall, however, was limited to cars registered in areas with high humidity, mainly along the Gulf Coast and places like Puerto Rico and Hawaii. Ford said it was expanding the recall nationwide — and globally — adding another 447,000 vehicles to the list. That brings the total under recall to 538,977 worldwide, 462,911 of which are in the United States, the company said. The expanded recall affects 2005-8 Mustangs, and 2005-6 GTs. The GT is Ford’s ultra-high-end sports car, which retails for about $140,000. The automaker said it was aware of one injury in an accident that may be related to the faulty Takata airbags — which have mushroomed into a global safety crisis. More than 15 million vehicles with the faulty airbags by 10 automakers have been recalled in the United States. At least five deaths and dozens of injuries have been linked to the faulty airbags, and the scope of the defect has led to a standoff between the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Takata. The safety agency has demanded that Takata issue a nationwide recall of all driver’s-side airbags, but the Japanese supplier says that the agency does not have the authority to compel such an action from a supplier like Takata. The supplier has also said that evidence does not support expanding the recall nationally, even though it is continuing to test the airbags. The agency’s deputy administrator, David Friedman, has said that the agency is preparing to initiate a formal process to compel Takata to order the recall. So far, the safety agency has not yet explicitly said it will bring a similar action against automakers themselves — though Mr. Friedman said it was prepared to compel the remaining car companies to issue national recalls. “Chrysler, BMW and Takata have failed to take the same action and, if necessary, we are prepared to force them to do so in the interest of public safety” he said in a statement on Thursday. Three automakers, Honda, Mazda and now Ford, have agreed to issue national recalls on driver’s-side airbags made by Takata. Dave Buchko, a spokesman at BMW America, said that the automaker was “evaluating the situation” but for now, the limited regional recall of driver’s-side airbags in its cars would remain in place. “Our action, which was undertaken to collect driver’s-side airbags from those high-humidity states in order to analyze them, is ongoing,” Mr. Buchko wrote in an email. Chrysler did not respond to a request for comment. Currently, regulators have not called for similar national recalls of Takata’s passenger-side airbags. Mr. Friedman recently testified before Congress that federal officials’ analysis of testing data had not yet shown passenger-side airbags malfunctioning in areas with low humidity. But he said the agency continued to investigate, and that it was hiring its own independent lab to test the Takata airbags. At the same time, Takata itself has started a public relations campaign aimed at repairing its tattered reputation. The company hired Sard Verbinnen & Company, a public relations firm based in New York that handles companies in crisis. Takata bought full-page advertisements that appeared on Thursday in several newspapers, including The New York Times. In the advertisements, titled “An Open Letter From Takata Corporation,” the company’s chairman and chief executive, Shigehisa Takada, said the supplier would “work in unison with automakers to advance our common goal of putting the safety of customers first.”
