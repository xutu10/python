Hiring Picks Up, and Jobs Data Hints at Coming Wage Gains
More than five million people were hired in September, and the number of people who quit jobs jumped, two signs of economic improvement.

WASHINGTON —  Companies ramped up hiring in September, and more Americans — the most in over six years — were confident enough to quit their jobs, the government reported Thursday. More than five million people were hired in September, the most since December 2007 when the recession began, the Labor Department said. And the number of people who quit their jobs jumped to 2.75 million from 2.5 million. More quitting and hiring means that the job market is becoming more dynamic, which creates additional opportunities for the unemployed. Greater quitting is a good sign for several reasons: People are more likely to leave jobs when they have a new position lined up, usually one that is higher-paying. Workers also quit when they are more confident they can find a new job. And quits open more positions that can be filled by those out of work, or by people seeking higher pay. “If this pickup is sustained, it will add to the evidence that wage acceleration is likely in 2015,” said Jeremy Schwartz, an economist at Credit Suisse. Job openings fell to 4.7 million from 4.9 million in August. Still, August’s figure was the highest in nearly 14 years, and September’s figure remains strong. The data The increase in hiring suggests that companies are filling more of their open jobs. That’s important because earlier in the recovery, net job gains occurred mostly because layoffs fell. Thursday’s report shows that gross hiring is now picking up. The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, has cited the level of quits as a key indicator of job market health. She and other Fed officials are monitoring it and other data from the report as they consider when to raise short-term interest rates from near-zero levels. Most economists forecast that won’t happen until the middle of next year. Manufacturers, health care providers and hotels and restaurants drove the increase in hiring in September. So did professional and business services firms, which include higher-paying fields such as accountants and engineers, as well as temporary jobs. Construction hiring fell. In a separate report, the Labor Department said Thursday that more people sought unemployment benefits last week, but the increase was not sharp enough to disrupt the job market’s positive momentum. Weekly applications rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 290,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased 6,000 to 285,000, up slightly from what had been the lowest average in more than 14 years. Applications are a proxy for layoffs. The four-week average has plunged 17.2 percent in the past year, a sign that businesses feel more confident about their prospects, are holding onto workers and are potentially looking to increase hiring.
