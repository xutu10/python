Following in the footsteps of other digital brands like  At a convention in San Francisco on Friday for its hosts — people who rent rooms or apartments to travelers — Airbnb will formally unveil its new quarterly magazine, Pineapple, named after the fruit that was a symbol of hospitality in colonial New England. The 128-page winter 2014 issue, which carries no advertising, contains features on three cities popular among Airbnb hosts and guests: San Francisco, where the company is based; London; and Seoul, South Korea. In an introductory note, the magazine said it aimed “to explore our fundamental values: sharing, community and belonging,” and to “inspire and motivate exploration, not just within the cities featured, but within any space a reader finds themselves.” The issue includes an interview with Hans Ulrich Obrist, curator of the Serpentine Gallery in London, on “architecture’s role in bringing us closer together and what the idea of home means to him”; guides to the London neighborhood of Peckham and the San Francisco neighborhood of Outer Sunset; and a feature on the food scene in Seoul. The four-color photography is plentiful, while copy is somewhat limited. Governmental bodies in the three cities covered in the magazine’s first issue generally have been supportive of Airbnb’s business model, especially recently. Other destinations — particularly New York —  Andrew Schapiro, head of brand creative for Airbnb, said the company had been considering starting a magazine for several years and was moving forward now following its rebranding campaign and new symbol, the “Bélo, the universal symbol of belonging,” announced last July. He said 18,000 copies of the magazine, created internally at Airbnb and written by freelancers, would be distributed free to hosts globally, including in San Francisco, London and Seoul, and at the Seoul Design Festival this month, which Airbnb is sponsoring. Pineapple also will be sold in bookstores and other retailers in North America and Europe, priced at $12 in the United States, 9 pounds in Britain and 11 euros in Europe. Airbnb is underwriting the cost of the first issue, Mr. Schapiro said. When asked if the magazine would carry advertising in the future, he said Airbnb was looking at “ways of scaling this idea going forward.” The publication got mixed reviews from publishing and travel experts. Abe Peck, director of business to business communication at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, said it was “not beating you over the head with the Airbnb brand. They’re looking for travelers rather than tourists. I honestly don’t know if the off the beaten path concept is too soft.” Bjorn Hanson, a professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University, said most hotel brands offer guests “a publication of some form,” and that Airbnb’s new magazine “continues to position Airbnb as a legitimate hotel brand.” The new magazine, he said, “can create a membership-like feeling, which can contribute to brand loyalty.” But Henry Harteveldt, travel analyst for Atmosphere Research, said the magazine effort was misguided. Investing in sound advertising and customer and host communications, as well as improving its digital channels’ usefulness, “are all far more important,” he said.
