Large Producers and Retailers Cutting Back on Packaging
In the United States, packaging makes up about 30 percent of all municipal solid waste. Mindful of the environment and their bottom lines, companies are trying to reduce that.

LONDON — British supermarkets are selling beer in glass bottles that are a third lighter than they were a few years ago. Unilever, which makes products like Dove cleansers and Sure deodorant, has pledged to reduce its packaging by a third by 2020. Dell is cushioning computers and server parts with wheat straw and a compostable, mushroom-based material, instead of Styrofoam. Across the business world, more companies, mindful of the environment and their bottom lines, are scrutinizing their packaging and cutting the excess. Less packaging means fewer raw materials to buy and lower shipping costs. The changes can also add up to fewer climate-warming carbon emissions and less garbage in landfills. “It’s good for Cisco, it’s good for our customers and it’s good for the environment,” said Kathleen Shaver, director of sustainability, risk and compliance at Cisco Systems, which says it has eliminated 1.9 million pounds of packaging this year. “Costs are reduced, not just with material you’re not buying, but with the material you’re not shipping and the material you’re not disposing of.” The volume of packaging is still vast and growing. Globally, consumer goods are encased in about 207 million tons of packaging each year, worth $384 billion, estimated  In the United States, packaging makes up about 30 percent of all municipal solid waste, down from 36 percent in 1970, said Susan Selke, interim director of Michigan State University’s School of Packaging. The overall amount of municipal waste, though, has more than doubled in that time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says. “Industry is paying attention, but not enough attention yet,” Ms. Selke said. The environmental impact of a product’s packaging is usually less than the footprint of the goods within, Ms. Selke said. But the visibility of packaging gives it a special status in the world of waste. “It’s almost a kind of archetypal image of consumer goods products, the pack on the shelf,” said Sandy Rodger, of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which seeks to promote an approach to material reuse known as the circular economy. “It has visibility everywhere: visibility for companies, visibility as a waste issue, visibility of plastic in oceans.” Generally, the environmental impact of producing packaging is greater than the impact of getting rid of it, because of the resources used, whether paper or petrochemicals, and the energy involved in manufacturing, Ms. Selke said. Packaging serves a positive role, companies and experts said, protecting products and preventing food from going bad. “If we’re not protecting the product, we’re actually wasting all the resources that went into the manufacture of the product,” said Richard Swannell, waste prevention director at WRAP, a waste reduction group backed by the British government. Efforts to reduce excess packaging range from the immediate and incremental to long-term visions of a waste-free world where goods and their wrappers are designed to be reclaimed, reused or composted, becoming a resource instead of a problem. In addition to its wheat straw and mushroom-based packaging, Dell is working with Newlight Technologies on a plastic that the companies say sequesters carbon dioxide. In Britain, major supermarket chains and food and beverage producers signed on in 2005 to the voluntarily  Manufacturers have redesigned glass and plastic bottles so they use less material to hold the same amount of liquid, Mr. Swannell said. “We targeted high-volume lines, like milk, like wine, like beer, and try to get them to shift to more resource-efficient designs,” he said. Sellers realized, for example, that tall, thin beer bottles use less glass than short, wide ones, he said. “In a supermarket now, you pretty much see only tall, thin bottles,” Mr. Swannell said. The home improvement sector is also on board. DIY stores pledged to cut packaging 15 percent by 2012, then delivered a 25 percent cut, partly through innovations like shipping sofas in bags that delivery workers remove and reuse, instead of disposable cardboard and plastic, Mr. Swannell said. Unilever has pledged to halve the greenhouse gas emissions created by its products and the waste associated with their disposal by 2020. Paul Howells, vice president for packaging research and development, says this requires not just reducing the amount of material, but rethinking the way things are made. “For us as packaging designers and packaging developers, at the outset of an innovation,” he said, it is critical “to ask ourselves the question ‘How can we design this so that the materials that we use will have more than one life?’ ” In Britain, Unilever has started selling a compressed version of its Sure, Dove and Vaseline spray deodorants, shrinking the size of cans by half, a change that cuts the aluminum content by a quarter and requires 35 percent fewer trucks for shipping, the company said. Unilever is also using a new type of plastic, starting in bottles of some Dove skin care, in which embedded air bubbles reduce the amount and weight of the material by 15 percent. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is trying to coordinate such efforts, working with McKinsey and the World Economic Forum on an effort known as Project MainStream. The project is trying to bring companies and cities together to coordinate the design of packaging and arrangements for its disposal. The group hopes to come up with a way to standardize the ingredients in plastic packaging, so any company or municipality can easily become part of one process of reusing and recycling packaging. “It’s integrating what it takes to design the packaging and what it takes to design the system that captures the packaging after use,” said Mr. Rodger, co-director of Project MainStream. Others are promoting smaller-scale changes billed as “disruptive innovations” — new ideas with the potential to shake up an established industry. David Edwards, a Harvard University engineering professor, said fruit skin was the inspiration for the edible packaging on the frozen yogurt balls that his company, WikiFoods, designed for Stonyfield Organic. The snack, called WikiPearl, is not entirely free of packaging. The balls are wrapped in a layer of paper. Changes to something as central to modern life as packaging may not come unless companies are pushed to do things differently, Mr. Edwards said. “The industry is going to have to have amazing leadership, given the investment and the way things are done now, the complexity of it,” he said. “It’s not going to be an easy path.”
