LOS ANGELES — Embarrassing, racially tinged emails about President Obama’s imagined movie tastes, leaked by hackers and published by Internet gossip sites, prompted public apologies on Thursday from Sony Pictures Entertainment’s movie chief and one of its top producers. “To anybody I’ve offended, I’m profoundly and deeply sorry, and I regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused,” the film producer Scott Rudin said in a statement after the disclosure of his private email banter with Amy Pascal, Sony’s co-chairwoman, about Mr. Obama and black-themed films. “I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive — and not funny at all.” Ms. Pascal said in her own statement: “The content of my emails to Scott were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am. Although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.” The  “What should I ask the president at this stupid Jeffrey breakfast?” Ms. Pascal asked Mr. Rudin in an opening query. She then speculated that she might ask if Mr. Obama liked “Django Unchained,” about a bounty-hunting ex-slave. Mr. Rudin countered with a suggestion about “12 Years a Slave,” while Ms. Pascal suggested other films involving African-Americans. Finally, Mr. Rudin wrote: “Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart.” The email referred to a broad comedy, from Universal Pictures, that starred Mr. Hart and Ice Cube. Mr. Rudin, who has been a producer of films like “Captain Phillips” and “The Social Network” for Sony, added in his apology,  The emails were disclosed as part of a continuing dump of documents by hackers who attacked Sony’s computer systems, beginning in late November. In a  “I’m not saying he’s a whore, but he’s a whore,” Mr. Culpepper wrote. Representatives of the studio did not comment on Mr. Culpepper’s remarks. One person briefed on Mr. Hart’s reaction said the actor has long been familiar with Mr. Culpepper’s penchant for “colorful” language. People familiar with Sony’s response to the attack, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, have said they expected to face further unauthorized disclosures in the days ahead.
