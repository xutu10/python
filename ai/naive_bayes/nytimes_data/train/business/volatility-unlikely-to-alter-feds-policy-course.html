Volatility Unlikely to Alter Fed’s Policy Course 
The Federal Reserve still plans to wrap up its bond-buying campaign at the end of October and remains likely to raise interest rates in mid-2015, although it now seems less likely to act sooner, analysts say.

WASHINGTON —  The  The Fed still intends to finish its bond-buying campaign at the end of the month. And it is still likely to start raising interest rates in mid-2015, although it now seems a little less likely that the Fed would act sooner, and more likely it would wait longer. “Just based on a short period of volatility, that’s not enough for me to make much of an adjustment,” Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in an interview on Saturday. “We need more time to evaluate whether we should be doing any updating. And I would say the financial market movements have not been triggered by very many real economic indicators.” Mr. Rosengren and other Fed officials say it is possible the market gyrations, and a downturn in inflation expectations, are early indications that they have once again overestimated the recovery. But the bulk of recent data has been more upbeat, and they see little harm in waiting for more information. “The stock market is much more volatile than the economy,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a research note to clients last week. “Sooner or later, then, the incoming data will calm the markets’ apparent growth fears, and talk of the Fed not beginning to tighten until 2016 will fade away.” The Fed has methodically pulled back from bond-buying over the last nine months. It plans to add a final $15 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities during October. Officials have pointed to the steady decline of the unemployment rate as evidence the economy no longer needs quite as much help. In recent weeks, however, market measures of inflation expectations have fallen sharply. On Friday, a measure called the break-even rate, which is derived from asset prices, implied annual inflation would run around 1.37 percent over the next five years. The decline may show investors have growing doubts the Fed will meet its stated goal of 2 percent annual inflation. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told Bloomberg News last week that the Fed should consider delaying the end of its bond-buying program. Such a decision would show that “we are watching and we’re ready and we are willing to do things to defend our inflation target,” Mr. Bullard said. But that view appears to command little support among other Fed officials, in part because market-based measures are viewed as relatively foggy. Mr. Rosengren noted that the measures, which compare  “Trying to draw inflation expectations from market prices is perilous,” Mr. Rosengren said. “We need more time, and if it’s a flight to safety that’s a different story than if it’s a story that inflation expectations are becoming unhinged.” John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in an interview with Reuters last week that if the Fed did decide more stimulus was needed, he would prefer to respond first by delaying interest-rate increases. That view is shared by most Fed officials, Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote last week. “We believe Williams’ preference for communication about the expected path of the funds rate instead of more asset purchases is reflective of the majority attitude on the committee,” he said. Officials are similarly doubtful that recent market volatility reflects a change in the underlying economy — or that it will have broad economic consequences. “When risk assets dropped last summer, all financial conditions tightened sharply: credit spreads widened, equities fell and yields spiked,” analysts at Barclays Capital pointed out in a note to clients last week. That has not happened this time. Indeed, some Fed officials had suggested in recent months that a little more volatility would be a good thing, helping to discourage excessive risk-taking. Concerns about persistently low inflation, however, may be reducing the chances that the Fed would start raising rates before the middle of the year. Mr. Williams, an influential centrist, told Reuters he still thought a midyear increase was most likely, but that the greater risk was now that the Fed would need to wait longer. By the Fed’s preferred measure, an index of personal consumption expenditures, inflation was just 1.5 percent over the 12 months that ended Aug. 31. Most of the 17 members of the Fed’s policy-making committee predicted in September that inflation would not increase to 2 percent in either of the next two years. And measures of inflation expectations based on consumer surveys are also drifting downward. The most prominent survey, conducted by the University of Michigan, reported on Friday that consumers expected 2.8 percent inflation over the next year — the lowest forecast in the last four years. A survey created by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  Some Fed officials are concerned that the Fed risks waiting for too long before beginning to raise interest rates. In a recent interview, Loretta J. Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, pointed to research by her staff that found unemployment had “almost” returned to a normal level, based on  “They’re all basically showing that we’re getting close to our goal in terms of slack being reduced,” she said. “That’s significant.” Ms. Mester also said she was “not too disturbed” by the persistence of sluggish inflation. She said she still expected inflation to return to the Fed’s 2 percent target, but that “inflation is a gradual process.” But other officials have argued with increasing vigor in recent weeks that the greater risk is premature retreat. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, is the most outspoken.  Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has made a similar case less pointedly. “I feel that before the Fed raises rates, we should have a great deal of confidence that we won’t be forced to backtrack on our moves,” Mr. Evans
