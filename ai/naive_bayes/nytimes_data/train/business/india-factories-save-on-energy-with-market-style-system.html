In India, Factories to Count and Sell Their Energy Savings
An innovative and closely watched program is designed to encourage many of the largest industrial plants to keep their energy use in check.

SAN FRANCISCO — India, the world’s third-largest producer of greenhouse gas, after China and the United States, has resisted international pressure to commit to capping planet-warming emissions. But when it comes to saving energy, India is moving ahead briskly. Its innovative and closely watched program called  The program sets a goal of cutting energy use an average of about 4 percent per unit of output at the factories. Those that save extra energy can sell their savings to plants that fail to meet their targets. It is a market-style system akin to  “What’s being launched is a national program of trading in certificates representing energy savings,” said Noah Sachs, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, who spent the spring studying the program. “It’s really interesting. There’s no other country in the world that’s doing this so ambitiously.” India’s motivation stems partly from climate concerns, but it is mostly about being thrifty with energy across its growing economy. The nation imports a large and increasing amount of fossil fuels, including coal, which is its dominant source for generating electricity. Energy saved by factories could be made available for economic development and to provide electricity to the nearly 300 million Indians who lack it. Nearly 500 industrial plants are covered by the program, which takes full effect next year and applies to factories in eight industries, including aluminum, cement, steel, thermal power and textiles. The plants together accounted for about 36 percent of the total fossil fuel consumption in India in 2010, according to the country’s Bureau of Energy Efficiency. “The Indian program is particularly promising because it is a national, as opposed to a regional or statewide or provincial, program,” said Richard Sandor, the chairman of Environmental Financial Products, a firm that has helped introduce several climate-related financial exchanges. At the beginning of the program, the government sent auditors to verify each plant’s energy use and economic output: for example, the number of tons of steel a plant might produce. The plants were then given energy reduction targets — generally between 1 percent and 8 percent per unit of output — to achieve over three years. Less-efficient plants were asked to save more energy than plants that were already efficient, said Ajay Mathur, director general of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency. Next year, from April to June, the factories will be evaluated again. Companies that save more energy than their targets required will receive certificates that starting in August they can then sell to companies that do not meet targets. In crafting Perform, Achieve and Trade, Mr. Mathur’s agency looked at a  Many questions remain about how well India’s program will work. Nobody knows how many companies will meet their targets next year, how much trading will take place or how much the certificates will cost. Both Indian government officials and outside experts emphasized that the program was in an early phase. “It is a start for energy efficiency in India, but it is not clear how much a success the program is, since the first round is still to end” next year, Aruna Kumarankandath, who works on renewable energy issues at the Center for Science and Environment, a New Delhi environmental group, said in an email. Of the 478 plants in the program, at least 217 reported that they had already met their targets by the end of March, a year ahead of time, according to the Bureau of Energy Efficiency. About 60 other companies seemed to be on a path to meet it. (The bureau has not verified the reports.) Professor Sachs of the University of Richmond said that the program’s initial goals did not substantially exceed energy-efficiency improvements that many Indian industrial plants would have made anyway because of competitive pressure or other factors. He noted, however, that the least-efficient plants might be forced to make improvements beyond business as usual. Saurabh Kumar, a former official at the bureau who now works at Energy Efficiency Services Limited, a company overseen by the government, said that it was important to start conservatively and that he expected the targets to be stronger in the next three-year phase of the program. That phase will begin by 2016 at the latest, after the first round’s effectiveness is assessed. “We are following a gradual approach,” Mr. Kumar said. “It is good to be inclusive to begin with and then ratchet up the standard.” Several industry representatives expressed support for Perform, Achieve and Trade and its goal of encouraging factories to save more energy. But Rupa Naik, executive director of the All India Association of Industries, and Vijay Kalantri, the association’s president, noted that new plants would have an easier time making efficiency improvements than existing ones. The cost to Indian industry of achieving the program’s targets “will be in the billions” of dollars, they said in a joint email comment. K.N. Rao, director for energy and environment of ACC Limited, a major Indian cement manufacturer, said that the three-year window helped ensure that the energy targets were largely achievable. Still, for various reasons, “some units are finding it difficult to meet the target,” he said in an email. One key to the program is ensuring the independence of the auditors who measure the energy use and economic output of the plants. The auditors are trained and accredited, Mr. Mathur said, and about 10 percent of the plants will be audited for a second time, by another auditor, to verify the initial report. In the next three-year phase, Mr. Mathur said, India’s program will expand to more sectors, possibly including refining, petrochemicals, railroads and electricity distribution. Smaller industrial plants will also be covered.
