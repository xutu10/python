Matt Taibbi, who rose to fame at Rolling Stone magazine as a fierce critic of Wall Street before joining First Look Media to start his own publication, is on a leave of absence from the company after clashing with his bosses, according to people familiar with the matter. The news of Mr. Taibbi’s leave was  Mr. Taibbi declined to answer questions on the matter, and messages for representatives of First Look Media, the company financed by the multibillionaire founder of eBay, Pierre Omidyar, went unreturned Tuesday. The people who confirmed the news were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Mr. Taibbi was brought in to create a magazine devoted to the “ongoing financial crisis — and to the political machinery that makes it possible,” according to a statement released in February  At the time, Mr. Taibbi said that it was obvious that the world was “entering a new phase in the history of journalism.” He added, “This is clearly the future, and this was an opportunity for me to be part of helping to found something and create something that might carry us into the next generation.” First Look Media was founded by Mr. Omidyar in October 2013, with the hiring of Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, two of the reporters who received leaked documents from the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, and the author and documentary filmmaker Jeremy Scahill. Mr. Omidyar said he would finance the new media company to the tune of $250 million. Its first publication, the Intercept, led by those journalists, began publishing in February and promised “fearless, adversarial journalism” focused on government and companies. Mr. Taibbi joined shortly afterward. He had built a reputation in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, by vociferously, even gleefully, skewering the misbehavior of Wall Street and its executives. Vivid metaphors he used to describe his views on the causes of the crisis included his description of Goldman Sachs as “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.” In August, the company released new details of the magazine, and said it was “set to release this fall.”
