Marshall Project Kicks Off With Look at Legal Delays

The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization focused on the American criminal justice system and led by Bill Keller, a former executive editor of The New York Times, went live this weekend, the latest in a crop of start-ups seeking a place in an increasingly fragmented journalism landscape. Mr. Keller has swapped the bustling corridors of The Times for a small office suite on the 25th floor of a Midtown Manhattan building, packed, on a recent afternoon, with some of the project’s 25 full-time employees. On Saturday,  The Marshall Project published two articles this summer and fall, but it has primarily focused on building its team. Twenty of the 25 full-time employees are journalists, including specialists in data and graphics. There are correspondents in Atlanta, Boston, Denver, Austin, Tex., and Seattle, said Mr. Keller and the Marshall Project’s founder, Neil Barsky, a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal who later pursued a career in finance. It has raised about 60 percent of its $10 million target, which represents a budget for two years, from groups including the Ford Foundation. The Marshall Project has had perhaps the quietest introduction among a recent group of new news start-ups. Vox Media hired Ezra Klein from The Washington Post, and his  “Not to say anything about anyone else out there, but it’s great to have a pro,” Mr. Barsky said of Mr. Keller, “a professional editor running the organization.” Mr. Keller, who joined The Times in 1984, won a Pulitzer Prize for international reporting as a Moscow correspondent, was a columnist twice, and served as executive editor from 2003 to 2011. He said that, in contrast to running The Times, he was now able to “talk to everyone who works for me almost every day, which is really a pleasure.” Criminal justice, Mr. Keller said, is a vast topic that he plans to tackle with ambitious projects, quicker daily articles on news events and a newsletter. There will also be articles written by prisoners, and interviews with corrections officers, police officers and others involved in the criminal justice system. On Sunday, the site featured an essay on an  “There are almost no limits to where you can go with the criminal justice angle,” Mr. Keller said, “because, you know, the institutions, law enforcement, the courts, the correctional facilities, but you’ve also got immigration, you’ve got drug policy, you’ve got race, you’ve got economic inequality.” Initially, the Marshall Project — named after  “As far as I know, folks like ProPublica and other nonprofit journalism organizations are 100 percent nonprofit, and then you have places like BuzzFeed or The New York Times that are 100 percent commercially supported,” he said. “Why can’t you have a hybrid? Once you amass an audience, once you have built a brand, why can’t we get corporate sponsorship, why can’t we have conferences, why can’t we have ads? I think that’s the way to be sustainable.”
