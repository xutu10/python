Stockpiles at the wholesale level increased 0.3 percent in September after an 0.6 percent rise in August, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Sales by wholesalers rose 0.2 percent in September after a sharp 0.8 percent August decline.

Swings in inventories can have a big impact on overall economic growth. The inventory increase reflected a 0.8 percent rise in stockpiles of durable goods, with auto inventories rising 1.2 percent and furniture up 1.5 percent. Inventories of nondurable goods fell 0.6 percent with declines in a number of areas, led by a 5.3 percent drop in petroleum.
