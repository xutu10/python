Things Are Looking Up for Employment
If the effect of the recession has simply been stronger and longer lasting than in most previous downturns, a pickup in the labor force participation rates for prime age groups should arrive soon.
===
IT was called the “jobless recovery” after the Great Recession ended in June 2009, and employment did not hit bottom until early 2010. But now, employment is growing at the fastest pace in years and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.8 percent from a peak of 10 percent. One reason the unemployment rate has declined, however, is that a lot of people seem to have dropped out of the labor force — and, therefore, are not being counted as unemployed. Some people always drop out during recessions, when they conclude that prospects of finding work are slim. But they normally come back when the market improves. It is not just the aging of the baby boomers that has caused the decline. Early boomers are now over 65, and people of that age are more likely to have retired and left the labor force. But as the accompanying charts show, the labor force participation rate has declined among all age groups under the age of 62. There have been a number of reasons suggested for the declines. Perhaps there is a greater skills mismatch, as the new jobs being created demand skills that unemployed people lack. Perhaps people who could not find work when they left school, and have been out of work for years, are simply estranged from the labor market. If those are major factors, then efforts to stimulate the economy might do little to get them into jobs. But if there is a large cyclical factor — if the effect of the recession has simply been stronger and longer lasting than in most previous downturns — then we ought to see a pickup in the labor force participation rates for prime age groups. Those who dropped out of the labor force because they could not find jobs nearly as good as the ones they previously held might be more tempted to return, particularly if tentative signs that wages are rising turn out to be correct. The coming year may provide the answer. Paradoxically, the best outcome might be if the number of new jobs continues to increase at a good pace but the unemployment rate stops falling, or at least declines more slowly. That would happen if more people decide to re-enter the labor market, ending the decline in the labor market participation rates among prime age workers, those 25 to 54 years of age. The unemployment rate, and the labor market participation rate, are based on a monthly survey of households, asking whether each person over the age of 16 is working or, if not, is actively looking for work. The results of that survey can be volatile, particularly among relatively small groups, and, of course, there are seasonal factors. Teenagers are far more likely to be in the labor force during the summer than when school is in session. The charts reflect the smallest age groups for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases results each month. To overcome the seasonal problem, as well as to minimize the volatility, the figures presented represent averages for the 12 months ending in each month shown. Most of the groups cover five-year cohorts, like 25 to 29, but those for the teenage years and the early 60s are shown in smaller categories because those are ages when many people are either entering or leaving the labor force. It should be noted that people move from group to group as they get older. Someone who was 29 in 2007 is now 36. As can be seen from the charts, the sharpest declines in the proportion of people working or looking for work have come among teenagers and those in their early 20s. That may not be bad news, if it indicates more such people are staying in school. Early in the recession, the proportion of men in the labor force declined. But more women age 25 to 39 joined the labor force, perhaps reflecting wives seeking jobs as the employment outlook darkened for their husbands. As the recession worsened, however, women of those ages began to leave the labor force. Above the age of 55, labor force participation rates initially rose for most groups after the recession began, no doubt because some people put off retirement. But the rates for both men and women in the 55- to 59-year group are now lower than they were when the recession began. Some people can choose when to retire; others have that decision made for them by their employers. Older groups still have higher participation rates than before the recession, but some of those rates have slipped this year.
