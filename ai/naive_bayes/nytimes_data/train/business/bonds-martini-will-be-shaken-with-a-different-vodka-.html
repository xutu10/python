James Bond will be drinking a new brand of vodka in “Spectre,” the forthcoming installment of the Bond thrillers.

SOME James Bond fans will be shaken, and others stirred, to learn that 007 is being given a new vodka for his martinis. Belvedere Vodka Although those involved declined to discuss the financial terms of the deal, Charles Gibb, president of Belvedere, described the partnership as “the largest to date” for the superpremium vodka in the two decades since it was first exported from its home country of Poland to major markets like the United States. “It’s our first major movie placement, too, beyond the sort of positioning of a bottle in a bar,” he said. In addition to Belvedere’s inclusion in “Spectre” — the 24th film in the Bond series, dating to 1962 — Mr. Gibb outlined extensive plans for the partnership that include worldwide advertising and public relations campaigns; two types of limited-edition bottles, both with 007 themes; promotions and events in locales like nightclubs, bars and stores; a presence in  Belvedere will join a lengthy lists of brands and products that are to be featured in “Spectre” along with Bond, portrayed again by Daniel Craig. Another is the luxury carmaker Aston Martin, which is  For most Bond movies, Smirnoff has been  Mr. Gibb said he was undaunted by the possibility that Belvedere might share screen time with other tipples because “any man of taste has a repertoire of what he drinks.” “If you go back into Fleming’s novels,” he added, referring to Ian Fleming, the author who created James Bond, “Bond prefers Russian and Polish vodka, which makes Belvedere a natural fit with the character.” Robert Passikoff, president of Brand Keys, a brand and customer-loyalty consultant firm in New York, said the partnership was “the kind of thing that gives products boosts,” particularly a vodka, which depends on attributes like “brand image and drinker self-image” to cultivate loyalty and engagement more than qualities like price or ingredients. Belvedere could use a boost, according to the annual Brand Keys Customer Loyalty Engagement Index, which ranks the brand ninth among vodkas, behind high-priced competitors like Grey Goose at No. 1; Ketel One at No. 2; Tito’s, tied for third with Smirnoff; and Chopin, tied for No. 5 with Skyy. As for the shifting, pay-to-play lineup of alcoholic beverages in Bond movies, Mr. Passikoff said: “Consumers have come to understand the business side of filmmaking. They’ve come to expect changes and do not pay much attention to each change. Paying for placement is on the rational side of the equation, and most of the interaction is on the emotional side.” Mission Media, which handles tasks like public relations for Belvedere, brought the brand together with the holders of the Bond rights. “As part of LVMH, Belvedere is very ambitious, always challenging us, asking us what can we do that’s bigger, that’s better, for the brand,” said Will Harris, joint chief executive of  Mr. Harris labeled himself a Bond “obsessive,” adding, “I have the films, the books, the movie posters.” He traced his affection back to watching the movies on television as he grew up in England, where, he said, Bond marathons were “a rite of passage for Christmas.” Mr. Gibb is also a self-described superfan, saying: “I’m a good Brit. Every time a Bond movie came out, it was a family event.” The creative agency for Belvedere is  Ads dedicated to supporting the Belvedere partnership with “Spectre” are likely to be produced, Mr. Gibb said, “in the next six months, for release in September or October next year.” “Spectre” has been ensnared in the  Hmmm. There may already be a plot for Bond’s 25th movie.
