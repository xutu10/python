Airlines Head Abroad, and Also Inland
The growing importance of international air traffic is redrawing route maps, even to cities away from the coastal United States.

HERE are some things to ponder from back in 36-B, with your knees pressed against the seat in front and your elbows wedged between you and the armrests. About 15 percent fewer commercial flights will take off this year compared with 2007, with 7.8 percent fewer seats available. Fares are up. Airlines in the United States are solidly profitable, with earnings at $3.8 billion in the first half of 2014, compared with $1.6 billion in the period last year. Even as service declines, most planes are full. So don’t expect improvements. Why would airlines want to fix something that from their point of view is demonstrably not broken? Those were a few of the trends under discussion recently at the Boyd Group International Aviation Forecast Summit in Las Vegas, attended by airline and airport executives and others in the industry. But underlying the obvious — tighter schedules, cramped airplanes, unhappy passengers, big profits — is one strong dynamic that is reshaping strategy, the growing importance of international business. According to the Boyd Group’s analysis, direct or indirect international traffic accounts for a bit over 25 percent of passengers on the three airlines in the United States with extensive global networks and alliances: American, Delta and United. Even Southwest Airlines is now flying internationally. Business travelers coming to the United States are a fast-growing segment, said Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group. “Mr. Zhang flies to Detroit from Shanghai to visit a factory. That’s a direct passenger. Then three days later he takes a domestic flight to Charlotte to visit a factory there. That’s an indirect international passenger,” he said. As this evolves in a global market, foreign carriers are more often flying directly to big-city airports in the interior of the United States, rather than just to the coasts. That will expand, Mr. Boyd said. Among the airports likely to attract more direct routes from foreign carriers in the next three to five years are Memphis, Kansas City, Cincinnati, Indianapolis and New Orleans, because they have good Interstate highway access in industrial bases with important global businesses, he said. As I’ve noted here before, domestic airlines are  Even Southwest, which flies the most domestic passengers among the four major carriers, has been shifting a bit away from some smaller-market flying, while also adding a few international routes in the Caribbean and Mexico, and scheduling service next year to Costa Rica. “We’ve had a conscious re-plumbing of our network,” said Andrew Watterson, the airline’s vice president for network planning. “We’ve reduced our exposure to short haul.” Short-haul flights, usually about 500 miles, now account for 43 percent of Southwest’s routes, compared with 53 percent in 2009. As this trend plays out, many midsize airports are trying with little success  In Indiana, Fort Wayne International Airport, has been shoring up its air service largely as a result of two things: a well-financed partnership with regional economic interests, and the fact that 75 percent of the passengers fly in and out of the airport on business, a high rate. “With all the changes in the airline industry, we knew there was going to be a trend away from smaller locations, and we also knew that there would be a huge impact on our ability to keep companies here if they thought our air service was not going to be adequate,” John Sampson, the president of the Northeast Indiana Regional Partnership, told me recently. Like most smaller airports, Fort Wayne was losing local passengers. “People were driving elsewhere to get either lower fares or for a flight schedule that better fit their needs,” Mr. Sampson said, even though the closest big airports, in Indianapolis and Detroit, are hours away. Smaller airports in such predicaments typically try to entice airlines with financial incentives. Sometimes, an airline might add a flight, but then drop it again after the incentive money runs out. But Fort Wayne has been adding some new service, taking another tack along with the incentives. It demonstrated that local business travelers would pay somewhat higher fares. “The point is that over a long term, we think the airlines need to know that we could keep that flight full and are willing to pay an appropriate market rate for those seats,” Mr. Sampson said. Several companies in the area do business abroad, including in China, he added. A recent payoff came in July, when Delta Air Lines replaced a small, one-class regional-jet flight between Fort Wayne and Atlanta with a larger jet that even has a first-class cabin. “Airlines get it,” Mr. Sampson said. “They know we’re willing to pay the fare.”
