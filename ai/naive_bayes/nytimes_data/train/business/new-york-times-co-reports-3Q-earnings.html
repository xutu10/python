The New York Times Company The Times planned to spur revenue growth during 2014 with the introduction of several new digital subscription products, but those products have not caught on as the company had hoped. Total revenue during the third quarter increased 0.8 percent to $365 million, compared with $362 million in the same period last year. The company posted a third-quarter operating loss of $9 million, compared with an operating profit of $12.9 million in the same period of 2013.

Digital-only subscribers, a number closely watched by analysts, some of whom suspect that growth may soon plateau, increased by 44,000 during the quarter, the best quarterly digital subscriber growth in nearly two years. The Times now has 875,000 digital-only subscribers. Third-quarter digital advertising revenue was $38.2 million, a 16.5 percent increase compared with the third quarter of 2013.

He also emphasized that audience development, an effort to attract more readers to the company’s digital properties, remained “a top priority.” The company’s quarterly earnings report came days after Mr. Thompson and the newspaper’s publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., announced the  “Our business is changing at a faster pace than ever, and we believe it is critical to have specialized business leadership in the key areas of digital and marketing in much the same way that we have in advertising,” the two said in a memo to staff. Also this week, the executive editor of The Times, Dean Baquet, announced that as part of an effort to cut costs in the newsroom, the paper would cease publishing a stand-alone Autos section. Although the paper will continue to write about automobiles, he said that he and other executives concluded there was “no longer an economic reason for a separate section.”
