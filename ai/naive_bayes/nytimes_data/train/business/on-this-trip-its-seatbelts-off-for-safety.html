On This Trip, It’s Seatbelts Off for Safety
An excursion to a stone quarry in Italy involves winding roads and a cliff, but riders had to be prepared to take a leap in case of an accident.

I FEEL fortunate that my business travel allows me the opportunity to see the world and find inspiration in new locales, but airports and I don’t get along. Yet considering how much I am required to travel for business, it’s a relationship to which I have resigned myself. As senior vice president for design and construction with Brookfield Office Properties most of my business travel involves assessing continuing and future projects, as well as materials. I have to admit I arrive at airports at the last possible minute. Rushing from line to line, simply to wait again or even be delayed, is enormously frustrating. I know I am not alone in this assessment because the faces of my fellow business travelers show as much frustration as I often feel. Despite everything, once onboard I find something comforting about being encapsulated in a metal cylinder with wings and a coffee pot. I am at peace, and able to focus on what I need to accomplish in that moment. My modus operandi is to work on the way to my destination, to think and absorb, and use the return trip for pleasure, catching up on books I’ve been meaning to read or the occasional movie that I have wanted to watch. But traveling by air is a lot easier sometimes than getting to stone quarries by car to assess product. I remember riding in an S.U.V. with a foreman of a marble quarry in Carrara, Italy. I was told not to put my seatbelt on, which I thought was kind of strange since we were traveling along tiny, winding roads. On the side of one road there was a cliff. There were no barricades. I thought a seatbelt was a good idea. I found out later the rationale for not wearing the seatbelt was that if the vehicle went over the side of the cliff the chances for our survival were better if we could “leap like a lion” out of the vehicle. Italy is a fascinating country and the people who work with the stones are real artisans. My job entails picking out the best product. I have strong opinions about what I like and what will work, and I immediately went to piles of stones that were not only beautiful, but also of extremely high quality. I don’t speak Italian, and I heard the men referring to me as “padrona.” I had no clue what that meant, and I got a little paranoid. After we were done I asked one of the people I was with what did “padrona” mean. I was really happy to find out that it translates to a female boss. It was cool because the workers accepted me as someone who really knew quality stones. We have been conditioned to expect inconvenience when we fly. On a recent four-day trip to Australia, I was running to catch a flight to another city within the country. As I hurried to the security checkpoint, I began taking off my belt, jacket and shoes, which is a common procedure in the United States. The Aussie security guard was perplexed, and perhaps a bit tickled, as he watched me flail. People around me looked kind of horrified. In my haste, I had forgotten that these measures aren’t required when flying domestically “down under.” I will never forget the guard grinning and saying, “Madam, please keep your clothes on.” Suffice it to say, I did.
