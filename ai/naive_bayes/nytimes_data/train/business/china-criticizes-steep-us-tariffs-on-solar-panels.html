China Criticizes Steep U.S. Tariffs on Solar Panels
Beijing stopped short of threatening specific retaliation over the penalties, the latest round in a long-running battle.

HONG KONG — China’s Commerce Ministry strongly criticized on Wednesday afternoon the United States’ decision to impose broader antidumping and antisubsidy tariffs on solar panels from China, but stopped short of threatening specific retaliation. Solar panel manufacturing “is a strategic emerging industry related to global sustainable development,” the ministry said in a news release, adding that, “China urges the U.S. to solemnly consider the serious consequences caused by the U.S. ruling, to strictly comply with international rules and regulations, and to adopt a responsible attitude and behavior to appropriately manage trade frictions.” The new tariffs,  The decision was intended in part to close a loophole that had allowed Chinese manufacturers to avoid tariffs imposed in an earlier ruling by using cells made in Taiwan. The penalties, which are still subject to final confirmation by the International Trade Commission in Washington next month, are the latest round in a series of trade battles between Beijing and Washington over the past four years involving China’s rapid rise to dominance in solar panel manufacturing. The call for the United States to “appropriately manage trade frictions” appeared to be the latest hint of a broad desire in Beijing to pursue a negotiated settlement, along the lines of last year’s agreement between Beijing and the European Union. Officials in Brussels effectively set an annual quota for solar panel imports from China, provided that Chinese companies charged a fairly high price for those shipments, which would help European companies compete. That arrangement helped the Chinese industry stanch the heavy losses it had been incurring for exporting large quantities of solar panels for less than it cost to make them, which had led to bankruptcies of some of the country’s largest solar manufacturers. He Weiwen, a member of the executive council of the Beijing-based China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, a research group loosely affiliated with the Commerce Ministry, said in an email on Wednesday that he thought the latest tariffs by the United States Commerce Department were not reasonable. The department “should consider possible solutions through consultation and negotiations, like the China-E.U. photovoltaic case,” he said. But the Obama administration has been hesitant to pursue a similar deal. Environmentalists have been leery of any agreement that keeps prices fairly high for renewable energy. Free-trade advocates contend that quotas are a worse kind of trade restriction than tariffs because they encourage companies to collude in dividing up markets and, unlike tariffs, do not produce any tax revenues to help lighten the burden on other taxpayers. The Commerce Ministry statement also said that China would consider “exercising its rights” as a member of the World Trade Organization. W.T.O. rules prohibit subsidized exports and dumping — exporting goods for less than they cost to make and ship. The rules allow countries to retaliate by restricting imports of subsidized or dumped goods, as the United States says it has done with Chinese solar panels. China denies that it has subsidized solar panel exports, even though Chinese companies, in public filings and in interviews granted by executives, have indicated such subsidies exist. China also denies that its companies have dumped solar panels, although the Chinese industry was racked by  But the W.T.O. also has extensive rules for how antidumping and antisubsidy penalties are calculated. Chinese officials have periodically criticized the American techniques for doing so, and the Commerce Ministry statement showed that they continue to scrutinize them. Frank Haugwitz, a longtime solar industry consultant in Beijing who is the director of the AsiaEurope Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory Company, said on Wednesday that some Chinese solar panel manufacturers were considering whether to move part of their production to Malaysia,  But there has been nervousness in China and Malaysia that a Chinese shift of production to Malaysia could embroil that country in trade disputes as well. And Chinese manufacturers have many factories operating at low capacity or idled in China itself, after years of extensive assistance from national, provincial and local government agencies in China, making them leery of building yet more factories elsewhere.
