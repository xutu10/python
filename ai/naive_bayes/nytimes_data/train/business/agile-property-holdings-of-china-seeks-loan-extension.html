HONG KONG — The Chinese developer Agile Property Holdings, battling an industry slowdown and speculation about ties to China’s former security chief, said that it was in talks with banks about extending a bridge loan and that the founder’s family would commit to lending $200 million. Shares in the company, valued at around $2.1 billion, slumped by as much as 31 percent on Monday to five-year lows as they resumed trading after a week’s halt. The company last week scrapped a proposed $360 million rights issue, which would have gone toward repaying what remains of a $475 million loan due in December, and said its billionaire founder and chairman, Chen Zhou Lin, had been detained. Chinese property companies face tight credit and excess supply as growth in the world’s second-largest economy slows. Weaker sales have choked liquidity at some property developers, pushing them to look for fresh sources of funding. On a call with analysts on Monday, Agile’s chief financial officer, Sam Cheung, said the company was in talks with banks including HSBC, Standard Chartered and Hang Seng Bank about extending the loan. The company, which is currently run by Mr. Chen’s wife and brother, would consider other funding options, he added, including another try at a rights offer, equity financing or commercial property sales. Mr. Cheung said Agile had 6 billion renminbi, or about $1 billion, to be repaid this quarter and 7.3 billion renminbi in the first half of 2015. He said the Chen family would commit $200 million to covering the loan. “Shareholders’ commitment will be ready within one or two days. So you can rest assured the committed shareholders will continue to support the company. Financially, they’re very sound,” he said. Agile said Mr. Chen, whose family wealth of $3.2 billion was ranked 51st in China on the 2014 Hurun Rich list, had been required by the prosecutor in Kunming City in southeast China to stay at “a designated residence” since Sept 30. It has not said why Mr. Chen was detained, but noted on Monday’s call that three plots of land it bought in Yunnan province, part of a 3 billion renminbi investment, were acquired through “proper auctions.” Kunming is the Yunnan provincial capital. Bond market observers said a loan rollover would be the most likely solution for Agile, which has other loans outstanding to its long-term relationship lending banks. In a statement early last week, Agile said online allegations linking the company with Zhou Yongkang, the country’s former domestic security chief and the highest-profile figure caught up in Beijing’s crackdown on corruption, were “entirely groundless and totally fabricated.”
