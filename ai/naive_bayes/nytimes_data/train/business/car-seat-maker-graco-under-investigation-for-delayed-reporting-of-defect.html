Car Seat Maker Graco Under Investigation for Delayed Reporting of Defect

Federal safety regulators on Monday began an investigation into whether Graco Children’s Products delayed reporting a safety defect that eventually led to the nation’s largest recall of children’s car seats.

The agency’s deputy administrator, David Friedman, is set to testify on Wednesday at a congressional hearing looking into defective airbags made by the Takata Corporation.
