Virginia Threatens to Remove Guardrails Unless Manufacturer Performs New Tests 
Guardrails sold by Trinity Industries have been at the center of safety concerns raised by other states, including Missouri and Massachusetts.

Concern is mounting over the safety of guardrails sold by  Virginia, in a letter sent to the company on Friday, told Trinity that state transportation officials did not believe Trinity had properly tested the end of a guardrail it redesigned in 2005. Virginia officials also told Trinity, which is based in Dallas, that the company had made changes to the design without telling them. If the company does not conduct new tests, in the presence of Virginia officials, and provide proof to the state’s Transportation Department by Oct. 24, the state will ban the product, officials said. “We’ve given them a deadline to provide the research we’re asking for,” said Marshall Herman, a department spokeswoman. “If they can’t prove to us it’s safe for use on Virginia roads, then we’re not going to use it, and we’ll begin to inventory where the product is installed and look into removing them.” A Trinity spokesman, Jack Todd, said the company would “fully cooperate and gladly participate” as states review the guardrails. As for Virginia’s finding, he said, “Trinity will engage directly with that agency to discuss and address their letter.” The Trinity guardrail has been at the  At issue is a design change Trinity made to the ET-Plus in 2005, which some state regulators and the federal lawsuit say can turn a guardrail into a spear when struck head-on. Those changes were not disclosed to federal regulators for seven years, despite requirements that any such changes be immediately reported. Trinity is a major guardrail supplier nationally. Guardrails work by collapsing like an accordion when hit head on, absorbing the impact of the vehicle and helping it curl out of the vehicle’s way. Additionally, the so-called head, a flat piece of steel at the front of the guardrail, is supposed to slide along the rail itself, pushing aside the metal rail so it is safely out of the way. Instead, the redesigned Trinity product narrowed the channel behind the rail head, causing it to jam instead of sliding, some state officials say. When that happens, the rail becomes a knife that pierces directly into a vehicle — potentially injuring or killing occupants inside. Lawsuits blame the guardrails for five deaths, and more injuries, in at least 14 accidents around the country. According to internal Trinity documents, the change was expected to save the company $2 on every rail head. Virginia raised questions with Trinity about the guardrail in May, when it requested additional crash test documentation and diagrams about the ET-Plus. The state’s finding stands in contrast to that of the Federal Highway Administration, which has said that it had examined results of the crash tests in 2012 and deemed the guardrails eligible for federal-aid reimbursement. The New York Times reported on Monday that federal highway officials had expressed doubts about the guardrails before they offered public assurances. “We have no reliable data indicating that the ET-Plus end terminals are not performing as they were intended to perform,” Tony Furst, associate administrator for safety at the agency, wrote in January 2013 to a nonprofit group representing highway and transportation departments around the country. While states are ultimately responsible for their highway equipment, the federal agency plays a crucial role, because it provides guidance on which products are eligible for federal reimbursement dollars. Last Friday, Mr. Furst issued a memorandum requesting that state transportation departments provide information about the ET-Plus’s performance. A spokesman for the Transportation Department, Brian Farber, said, “Based on the available data, we will take any necessary steps to ensure safety on our highways.” Ms. Herman, the Virginia Transportation Department spokeswoman, said the state planned to make its own safety determination, regardless of any federal assurances. “Even if a product may be on the federal approved list, that doesn’t mean we’d want it on ours,” she said. Ms. Herman said Virginia has installed about 11,000 guardrails around the state since 2006. It still needs to determine how many of those were Trinity’s ET-Plus, a task the state will undertake if the company does not meet its request by Oct. 24. The pressure has been increasing on Trinity in recent weeks, including  In early September, a report by the University of Alabama at Birmingham studied crash data from nearly a decade in states like Missouri, and concluded that the ET-Plus rail was nearly three times as likely to result in a fatality than its predecessor.
