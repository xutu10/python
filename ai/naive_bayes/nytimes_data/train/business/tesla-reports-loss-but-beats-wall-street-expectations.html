Tesla Reports Loss, but Beats Wall Street Expectations
The electric automaker lost $75 million in the third quarter, less than what analysts had predicted.

Tesla But the earnings, announced on Wednesday after the markets closed, were better than expected, helping to raise the company’s stock in after-hours trading. The company, which unlike other automakers does not release monthly sales figures, said it delivered a record 7,785 Model S sedans in the third quarter, up 42 percent from the same period a year ago. However, it reduced its overall 2014 sales forecast to 33,000 vehicles, about 2,000 less than its previous estimate. The company also announced that it was delaying when its new sport utility vehicle, the Model X, will hit the market. Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, said the Model X’s delay until the third quarter of 2015 was tied to “getting the details right,” and he cited the challenges of ramping up the mass production of any new vehicle. But Tesla is sticking to its prediction of producing about 100,000 vehicles a year by the end of 2015, and aims to be selling half a million electric vehicles by 2020 — an ambitious forecast that has helped drive the company’s stock price higher and raised its market capitalization to more than half that of General Motors. “Hitting 500,000 sales a year is an awful difficult nut to crack when you have yet to sell 50,000,” said Jack R. Nerad, executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book. “Ironically, as a manufacturer transitions from a niche player toward higher volumes, many things get more difficult instead of easier.” On a non-GAAP basis, the company earned a profit of 2 cents a share. Analysts had predicted a loss of 1 cent per share. Tesla also beat forecasts with non-GAAP revenue of $932 million, up 55 percent. Analysts were expecting revenue of $892.1 million. The company’s cash fell about $300,000 to $2.4 billion during the quarter. Tesla’s new battery factory in Nevada, known as the Gigafactory, will be critical if Tesla hopes to reach its production goals. The company said the battery plant, which received state tax breaks topping $1 billion, was ahead of schedule but still two to three years away from opening. Mr. Musk, in a conference call with investors on Wednesday, brushed away any notion that other inventors would somehow get ahead of Tesla. “Everyone and their mom is approaching us about technology improvements,” Mr. Musk said. “Talk is supercheap.”
