The service, with items no longer than 140 words, is the magazine’s first attempt in its 171 years to produce a daily news product.

The Economist has built its success by being the weekly magazine that succinctly summarizes the news of the world. Now, as it aims for mobile readers, the magazine is trimming its prose even more. On Thursday, the magazine unveiled  John Micklethwait, The Economist’s editor in chief, said last week during a visit to New York that his team wanted to build something that would be manageable for readers. “The ‘finishability’ aspect is crucial,” Mr. Micklethwait said. “Everyone else is pushing out huge amounts of things.” He frequently hears from readers that they appreciate that they can read an entire issue of The Economist, he said. While breaking into the world of apps and quick updates may not be groundbreaking for many organizations, Espresso is The Economist’s first attempt in its 171 years to produce a daily news product. The magazine has had more success than many others in persuading readers to buy digital subscriptions. While its total circulation in the United States declined to 795,501 in 2014 from 833,104 the year before, its digital audience is growing, according to the Alliance for Audited Media. According to the latest figures, The Economist has 81,680 buyers of its app in the United States, compared with 62,523 the same time a year ago.
