Network Premiere Week Prompts Cheers at ABC and Groans at Fox
ABC’s Thursday night of dramas, featuring “Scandal,” “How to Get Away with Murder” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” posted impressive ratings, while Fox’s only bright spot was “Gotham.”

The traditional broadcast networks have faced an onslaught of challenges recently, including Netflix, binge viewing and a proliferation of hot shows on cable. But after the first four days of network premiere week, it appears that all is not lost. In fact, there may be some tentative clapping coming from executive offices at three networks: ABC, CBS and NBC. But at Fox, palms are much too sweaty for any applauding. Perhaps the biggest cheers are emanating from ABC, whose Thursday night of dramas — all under the aegis of its superstar producer Shonda Rhimes — posted impressive initial ratings, with the 9 p.m. hit, “Scandal,” scoring its highest numbers ever, and the new 10 p.m. drama, “How to Get Away with Murder,” standing out as the strongest new entry so far this season. (Ms. Rhimes’s third show is “Grey’s Anatomy.”) “How to Get Away with Murder” was so potent on its premiere that no other drama — not even existing hits like “The Blacklist” on NBC, or “NCIS” on CBS — topped its rating, a 3.8, in the 18-to-49-year-old category that ABC sells to advertisers. That success came a day after ABC also posted the best first-night rating for a new comedy this season with “Black-ish.” Four nights make a fitting first observation deck for the start of a TV season, because the next two nights are generally filled with shows with much lesser expectations. The overall impression so far is that the three older networks have aimed to be as broad as possible in their reach, with initial success. Fox has played a more niche game, where misses mean empty niches. So far, the network has had one hour to be happy about: 8 p.m. on Monday, when its new Batman origin drama “Gotham” got off to a solid start. But it looks as if the superhero will have to fly in with an extra-large utility belt to save the network on his own. The network’s Tuesday comedies, “New Girl” and “The Mindy Project,” barely reached two million viewers in their initial outings. That is a shocking falloff for “New Girl,” which looked like a breakout hit three years ago. “Mindy,” while a critical favorite, has never found an audience much bigger than cable comedies — a sort of “Mendoza Line” for network performance — but it now falls under even that modest level. And Fox’s bold play with a new reality show, “Utopia,” appears to be a disaster. Its ratings so far would be bad for the summer; for premiere week, they have put the show well out front in the race for first show canceled this season. The caveat offered by all the networks is that nothing can really be determined about a show’s performance until delayed viewing is counted — and each network now sends out projections of a show’s numbers seven days down the road. Shows will often improve by as much as 50 percent when delayed viewing is added. But executives at several networks conceded that they examine the first night’s results closely because they are still strong indicators of the general strength of shows. The executives in Los Angeles still wake up at 5 a.m. to check the first numbers that arrive from the country’s biggest cities. They know the deal: Shows that open strongly still have the best chance at success; those that open limply almost never survive. CBS has mastered the art of opening shows for years, sticking to its knitting with broad appeal, largely crime-centered shows. So far, two new entries, “Scorpion” and “Madam Secretary,” have opened well for the network. And, of course, CBS has its new package of N.F.L. games on Thursday to provide a boost that all but guarantees that the network will be up in ratings for premiere week this season. NBC seems to have borrowed a page from CBS, playing with its strength on Monday and Tuesday — which means the hit singing show “The Voice” — and putting together a CBS-like Wednesday: three broad dramas. The new entry at 8 p.m., “The Mysteries of Laura,” was among the most critically reviled of the new shows, but it attracted 10 million viewers. ABC benefited from a shrewd scheduling move that seemed to demonstrate, at least so far, that the idea of strategically placing a show in a specific time slot still makes sense for a network, even in a world where viewers can do their own scheduling thanks to DVRs. The network took advantage of the broad family appeal of its hit comedy “Modern Family,” by surrounding the show with other family shows. The 8:30 entry, “The Goldbergs,” was clearly helped by the adjacency to “Modern Family” at 9, and “Black-ish” at 9:30 held onto more of the “Modern Family” audience than any previous show ABC has slotted there. The other truism of premiere week is that nothing means anything until Week 2, when you see if viewers come back to shows they sampled. So the alarm clocks in Los Angeles will again be set for 5 a.m. — except perhaps for the Fox executives, who may not be sleeping well at all.
