Unemployment Data Points to Accelerating Economy 
Initial claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, while wholesale inventories rose in August by the largest amount in four months, both signs of an economy gaining traction.

WASHINGTON —  The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits in the United States fell last week to nearly its lowest level since before the 2007-9 recession, a sign of growing strength in the labor market. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 1,000, to a seasonally adjusted 287,000, in the week ended Oct. 4, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists had expected claims to rise. The data adds to the view that strength is building in the nation’s economy. “The labor market is entering into a potential boom,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank. A separate report released on Thursday showed that wholesale inventories rose in August by the largest amount in four months, a sign the economy may have grown more than expected in the third quarter. The Commerce Department reported that wholesale inventories increased 0.7 percent during the month, after a 0.3 percent gain in July. The gain in August was larger than had initially been estimated. Inventories are a key component in the nation’s gross domestic product. The component that goes into the calculation of G.D.P. — wholesale stocks excluding autos — increased 0.7 percent. Many economists say they think the economy grew at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the July-to-September quarter, much faster than average rates over the last few years. Jobless claims have fallen steadily since the United States emerged from the recession, and they are currently lower than they were before the nation’s economic crisis began. The level of claims last week was just 8,000 above a 14-year low that was reached in July. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends because it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 7,250, to 287,750, its lowest level since 2006. The report on jobless claims comes nearly a week after the Labor Department reported robust job growth in September, with employers adding 248,000 jobs and the unemployment rate falling to 5.9 percent from 6.1 percent in August. The Labor Department said the number of people still receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 21,000, to 2.38 million, in the week ended Sept. 27. “The gradual improvement in continuing claims is particularly encouraging and is consistent with recent declines in the unemployment rate, suggesting that unemployed workers continue to find gainful employment,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, a United States strategist at TD Securities.
