GoPro, in its first quarter as a publicly traded company, reported better-than-expected profit and revenue, driven by strong demand for its wearable cameras, which are used by surfers and sky divers, among others. Shares in GoPro, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., rose 6.7 percent in after-hours trading. “The social media side of the business had great metrics, with YouTube content up 92 percent year-over-year, YouTube views up 99 percent,” said Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst. “All this indicates growing brand awareness, and bodes well for a successful holiday.” The net income attributable to GoPro shareholders was $14.6 million, or 10 cents a share, in the third quarter to Sept. 30. Excluding items, the company earned 12 cents a share, topping the average analyst estimate of 8 cents. Revenue rose about 46 percent to $280 million. Analysts on average had expected $265.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System.
