One Key to Exports: Liquid Gas
With technology for liquefying natural gas improving, so is the likelihood of the United States become an exporter rather than an importer of L.N.G. in the coming years.

New methods of producing  That is likely to happen, industry authorities say, because the technology for liquefying gas — essential for taking it across oceans — also continues to improve, making the process more economically efficient and environmentally safer. With exports virtually nil now, the Energy Department forecasts shipments abroad of liquefied natural gas equivalent to two trillion cubic feet by 2020, roughly 7 percent of expected domestic production. Target markets would be Western Europe and Asia, where gas costs more to produce. “People are looking more at new, unique solutions for L.N.G. exports,” said Tom Campbell, a director at  Basic liquefaction is not all that creative. Natural gas, or methane, is compressed by forcing it through turbines in several steps until it becomes dense and cold enough — minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 162 Celsius) — to turn into a liquid. But each facility must conform to an idiosyncratic set of circumstances that affect how the process is carried out: its geography and topography, the amount and quality of gas — pure natural gas is methane, but much of what comes out of the ground contains impurities of one sort or another that have to be cleansed — and where the gas is going and how it is going to get there. All else being equal, bigger is almost always considered better when it comes to liquefying gas. “The technology has been around for quite some time, but for it to be economically viable requires significant scale,” said Bruce Bullock, director of the  But a necessary one. Turning methane into a liquid conveys several advantages, especially for transporting over long distances. Liquefied gas occupies about one six-hundredth the space as the same quantity does in gaseous form, and it is nontoxic and nonflammable. There are various benefits to shrinking gas in an expansive way. One refrigeration unit, called a train, costs $2 billion or more. But as a plant installs more trains (so called because they are narrow and tend to be arranged sequentially), they become cheaper because the high cost of planning, engineering and construction is spread out over more units, and supplies can be sourced cheaper in larger quantities. The cost to build other parts of liquefaction facilities — storage tanks, jetties where ships are loaded, the initial planning, site preparation and so forth — is also spread out. Once a plant is open, more trains mean lower operating expenses because the plant can be put to fuller use. Having two trains instead of one cuts the cost of liquefying each cubic meter of gas by nearly 30 percent, Mr. Bullock said, and plants can have up to eight trains — which should further lower expenses. Further cost reductions are accruing, people in the industry say, because the efficiency of the liquefaction process is increasing as technology is enhanced. “Efficiency has improved big time in the last 10 years,” said Luca Maria Rossi, general manager for turbomachinery solutions at G.E. Oil & Gas, part of General Electric. The compressors that liquefy gas run on gas themselves. A decade ago, about 70 percent of the energy used in the process was lost through heat dissipating into the air, Mr. Rossi said. The figure has dropped to 60 percent, and he expects it to reach 50 percent within a few years. Burning less gas makes the process cheaper and also cleaner, he added, because less carbon dioxide and other pollutants are released. Liquefying gas more cheaply is essential because higher commodity prices and greater global demand for facilities, as well as demand to build them on more remote terrain, is driving up construction costs. “For a long time there was a downward trend in costs, as train size and plant size got larger and you had economies of scale,” said Amos Avidan, corporate manager of engineering and technology for Bechtel, which builds liquefaction facilities. “With escalation around the world, a similar facility costs two to three times what it did 10 years ago.” He noted that construction is generally cheaper for American plants because they tend to be in locations with easier access. Mr. Campbell at Stratas highlighted two competing design trends that are influencing costs, one to make plants the same, the other to make them different. Some exporters are moving away from “world-scale terminals,” he said, and creating smaller facilities to ship gas to smaller markets like Central America and the Caribbean. As for full-size facilities, he said, companies are trying to cut costs by relying more on modular construction techniques, standardizing the specifications of trains and other elements so they can be replicated for similar sites with similar terrain. Mr. Avidan said that the trains for the  “That should allow us to do things more efficiently,” Mr. Avidan said. “The revolution in technology is enabling us to change the work process, and we’re just at the beginning of it.”
