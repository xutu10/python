In a Position Beyond His Control
A flight attendant’s mishap foils the usual early-morning flight plan for the chief operating officer of the Breeders’ Cup.
===
A LOT of my career was spent in the banking industry. I didn’t travel much for work, and if I did it was all short-haul regional trips. Every now and then I would get to go to some big group meeting that involved a longer flight and I would get kind of excited. Though business travel was limited, my wife and I always enjoyed traveling for leisure and exploring the world. Neither of us had that opportunity when we were growing up, and now that we have children we want to show them what the world offers, both here and overseas. As chief operating officer of the Breeders’ Cup, travel is so integral to the business that it feels as if I’m at the airport more than I’m at home. While I might enjoy traveling for pleasure, business travel makes me cranky. My wife and daughters swear by yoga. They say it reduces stress and makes them feel good. I haven’t tried it, but I do try some deep breathing exercises to calm me down. I don’t always have misfortune in my travels, and one time earlier in my career when I was young and interning in the state legislature in Frankfort, Ky., I managed to turn one round-trip ticket into three round-trip tickets by volunteering to give up my seat. Since I almost always have a layover nowadays, I always book the first flight out in the morning. I’ll even stay an extra day in the place I am to avoid taking an afternoon or night flight, which may not get me all the way home to Lexington. I absolutely hate being stranded at airport hotels. But even my fail-safe early-morning flight doesn’t always get me home when I need to be. On one trip I opted to do my usual and stay in Los Angeles an extra night so that I could take the first flight out at 6 a.m. the following day. I needed to be home that evening for a family party and I assured my wife that I’d be there in plenty of time. The flight from Los Angeles was on time that morning and I was sure I would be home for the party. But a flight attendant somehow had gotten her hand into a little issue with an armrest. Apparently, her hand was caught somehow when she was jostled trying to retrieve something from between the seat and an upright armrest that came down after she was bumped. I’d certainly never seen heard of anything like that before, and apparently neither had any of the other flight crew team. They worked for an hour trying to unjam her hand. After a while it was clear that we needed specialists, in this case a couple of mechanics who came on board and disassembled the armrest from the seat. The attendant was just fine and the passengers were happy for her and happy to finally get going. I was happy, too, but the delay meant I was going to be very late to our family party, which may have meant an unhappy spouse. When I finally arrived home, I relayed the incident to my wife. I am indeed a lucky man since I have an understanding wife who didn’t roll her eyes. I think that has less to do with me, though, and probably a lot more to do with yoga. Maybe I really should try it.
