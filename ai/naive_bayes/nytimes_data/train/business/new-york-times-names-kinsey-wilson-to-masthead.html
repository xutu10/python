The New York Times has appointed Kinsey Wilson, a former NPR executive and USA Today executive editor, to its masthead to oversee innovation and strategy, the newspaper announced Tuesday. Mr. Wilson, 58, who will begin his new job in February, will collaborate with the editorial and business sides of the organization, the company said in a statement, and will report to the executive editor, Dean Baquet. He will be responsible for “expanding mobile strategy and creating new digital products inspired by Times journalism,” the statement said, citing recent examples like the NYT Now and Cooking apps. Most recently, Mr. Wilson was an executive vice president and chief content officer for NPR, where he oversaw news gathering, programming and digital operations. He left NPR last month after six years at the organization. Previously, Mr. Wilson was executive editor of USA Today, and also worked at Congressional Quarterly and Newsday. In a note to employees, Mr. Baquet said that Mr. Kinsey will “help map our path to becoming a truly digital news organization.” Mr. Baquet added: “He will ensure that our journalists have the tools they need to tell great stories, and that we engage and serve our readers wherever and however they come to us.” Mr. Wilson’s position will be equal to the paper’s deputy executive editors — Susan Chira, Janet Elder, Ian Fisher and Matthew Purdy — and its creative director, Tom Bodkin. Citing new digital initiatives such as a dedicated audience development team, Mr. Baquet said that The Times’ readership grew 21 percent in October to reach its highest level. The announcement of Mr. Kinsey’s appointment comes amid a round of staff reductions in the newsroom, aimed at reducing its size by about 100. If that number is not met with buyouts by next month, the paper has said, it will have to resort to layoffs.
