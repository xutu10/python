Fall TV Season Has Buzz, but It’s Growing Softer
Although cable and online television are making inroads on the network television season system, it remains intact driven by economic factors and the struggle to determine what shows are strongest.

It is a throwback, an archaic model, a vestige of a fading business. So why does a ripple of excitement continue to surround the start of another television season? Excitement may overstate the case. But among those in the business, as the broadcast networks once again offer full slates of original programming this week, a sense of eager expectation still beats in some hearts. “Look at the season previews you still see everywhere — in print, online, in podcasts,” said Preston Beckman, who in his long career has programmed the prime-time schedules at NBC and Fox. “There is still going to be a lot of focus on the new network shows. I’m not saying it’s like it was in the glory days. But I do believe this is the time of year when the networks get a chance to step up to the forefront.” But the broad pro-network view espoused by Mr. Beckman, who is now a programming adviser for Fox, is not shared in other quarters of the television business. Some in the industry wonder why there is a notion of a season kickoff at all because television programming is increasingly about timelessness and freedom of choice, with viewers deciding when they will watch programs. “With the growth of mobile devices and on-demand viewing and all the rest, I think premiere week really doesn’t matter much anymore,” said Brad Adgate, the senior vice president for research at Horizon Media, a media buying company. “Particularly among younger viewers, I don’t think premiere week means anything.” In a recent report on the business, Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research said, “Consumer behavior is changing and it appears impossible to stop.” Despite these doubts, the television season system remains intact, at least for now, driven by economic factors and a kind of Darwinian struggle to determine exactly what shows are fit to survive. The annual picks for hits and misses continue to pop up. The biggest bets for hits this season have been placed on the Fox drama “Gotham,” the comedy “ At the same time, conjecture abounds about things like which network is in the most trouble. The consensus: Fox, after its fortunes have declined in recent years with the descent of “American Idol” and the failure to find a fall reality series to fill hours — as “The Voice” does on NBC, “Dancing With the Stars” does on ABC, and “Survivor” does on CBS. The main economic factor driving the fall season is the advertising-sale ritual called the upfront, which takes place every May. Networks unveil their schedules and begin negotiations with advertisers about the rates to be paid for an entire 52-week year — one that starts in September. Negotiations now include even the terms for rating, such as whether to count delayed viewing over three days or seven. The upfront market was noticeably softer this year, with total spending estimated to have fallen 5 to 10 percent, to a total of slightly less than $9 billion. One explanation for the decline, television and marketing executives say, is that more advertisers have delayed spending to have more money available for commercial time later in the season. The shift can give marketers more flexibility and the chance to bargain for better rates. It also means a network can demand more money if a new show emerges as a major hit. As the networks vie with one another, they are increasingly finding that they no longer have the fall season spotlight to themselves, even in premiere week. The rest of the business used to back off until after the network program stampede. But this year, for example, the FX cable channel is running the final season of its drama “Sons of Anarchy” right in middle of the network fall debuts, and scoring impressive ratings. Last season, AMC ran the finale of “Breaking Bad” on the first Sunday of the network season. “Nobody’s afraid to take the networks on anymore, even in premiere week,” Mr. Adgate said. The competition for viewers has never been more fierce. Last year, cable networks alone broadcast 144 original series, up from 29 a decade earlier. Even more original series are in the works this year, including “The Divide,” on the WE tv network, and “Fortitude,” a drama about a murder that shakes an Arctic town, on Pivot, a network focused on the millennial generation. Netflix, the streaming service, has said that it will spend nearly $3 billion on content in the next year. It has several original series in the pipeline, including “Marco Polo,” a historical costume adventure. Amazon plans to release four original series, including “Transparent,” a comedy about a father who comes out as transgender to his adult offspring. “The competition is not just other TV networks right now,” said Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of 360i, a digital marketing agency with several television networks among its clients. “It is not just web series. We are in such an attention economy right now. If TV marketers are only looking at other TV programs, they already are way too far behind.” The flood of new series is coming as people are spending less time watching live television. Live viewing dropped more in the second quarter of 2014 than in the previous eight quarters, with the greatest decline among younger viewers, said Brian Wieser, a media analyst with Pivotal Research. The average adult watched four hours and 36 minutes of live television a day in the second quarter of 2014, down from four hours and 45 minutes two years ago, according to a recent Nielsen report. The time the average adult spent watching time-shifted television, meanwhile, jumped to 31 minutes a day in the quarter, up six minutes from two years earlier. Still, Mr. Beckman argued that in spite of all the factors battering the tradition of the network premiere week, it retains value, mainly for the attention it still brings to a business that needs all the attention it can get. “It’s not always going to be this way,” he said, “The eventual demise of a fall season is going to happen gradually, but it will still take a long time before it finally happens.”
