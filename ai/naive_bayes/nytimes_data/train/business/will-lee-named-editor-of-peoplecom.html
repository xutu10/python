People on Monday announced a crucial hire who will help determine the magazine’s digital future. Will Lee, vice president for digital content and programming for The Hollywood Reporter’s website, will take over People.com on Oct. 20. According to a statement released by the magazine, Mr. Lee will “provide strategy and vision” for the website and lead its digital team. Monday’s announcement marks a return for Mr. Lee to Time Inc. He started out working as an editorial assistant at Entertainment Weekly in 1998 and since then has written for Sports Illustrated. Since leaving Time Inc., he worked at the website TMZ as its New York bureau chief and helped start its television series. At the Penske Media Corporation, which owns The Hollywood Reporter, Mr. Lee also worked on its other brands like Deadline, Hollywood Life, TV Line and Boy Genius Report. Jess Cagle, editorial director of People and Entertainment Weekly, said in an announcement that Mr. Lee “will play an integral role in charting the future of a brand now celebrating its 40th birthday that has never felt more alive.” Mr. Lee’s new role carries plenty of pressure since the success of the celebrity magazine helps drive the success of its parent company, Time Inc. People generates more revenue than any of Time Inc.’s more than 90 magazines and 45 websites. Magazine industry consultant John Harrington estimated in an August profile of Mr. Cagle that People brought in $1.49 billion in 2013. Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc., said in an interview for that same profile that Mr. Cagle’s choice of the new People.com editor would be “ the most important thing that he does between now and the end of this year.” People.com also has plenty of work to do to grow online. As of August, in data tracked by comScore, People.com ranks fifth in the entertainment news category with 26.7 million unique visitors to its site, behind TMZ, Yahoo Celebrity, E! Online and TownSquare Entertainment News.
