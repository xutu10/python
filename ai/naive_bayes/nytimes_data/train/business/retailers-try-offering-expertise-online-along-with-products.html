Retailers Try Offering Expertise Online Along With Products
In order to gain the attention of search engines, companies are turning to “content marketing” like blog posts on relevant subjects, but the benefits are hard to pin down.

Desperate to save his family’s business during the recession in 2008, Steve Goedeker decided to try selling online. A traditional brick-and-mortar appliance retailer in St. Louis,  “We were struggling, trying to figure out what to do to keep this going,” Mr. Goedeker said. The move worked. Sales grew from $6 million in 2009 to $48 million in 2013. The payroll grew from 18 to 90 employees over the same period, and the St. Louis store now accounts for less than 10 percent of the company’s sales. “Our top states are California, Texas and Florida,” Mr. Goedeker said. “Moving online has transformed the company.” Late last year, however, Mr. Goedeker confronted a new challenge: He was sure there had to be a way to improve his search engine ranking to get traffic to his site without constantly riding what he calls the “never-ending treadmill” of paid ads. So in late 2013, he joined what has become one of web marketing’s biggest trends: content marketing. “As we were looking at ways to grow, content marketing kept coming up,” said Matt Davids, the company’s search engine optimization director. “The experts were all saying, ‘You need to be in content marketing, you need to be in content marketing,'  ” A buzzword that can mean different things to different people, content marketing generally refers to creating and publishing blog posts, images and other content that sets a company apart and positions it as a respected expert. “Content marketing can help a small-business owner show why you’re different from others in the field, what’s really in your DNA,” said Andy Seibert, managing director of  At its essence, content marketing is a tool for improving a company’s ranking on Google, said Michael Baliber, senior vice president and director of media strategy at the media agency  “There are a lot of positives from Google’s perspective, and that can only help your business,” said Mr. Baliber, who added that lists come up higher than chunks of text or white papers in search engine rankings. For its content marketing push, Goedeker’s hired two full-time writers and began publishing daily blog posts about home renovation and appliances, which were then shared on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus and Pinterest. Today, the company spends between $100,000 and $150,000 a year on its content marketing efforts, according to Mr. Goedeker. He says the goal is for the company to get 80 percent of its online traffic and half of its online sales with its content marketing efforts. So far, sales generated this way have risen from 8 percent to 14 percent of the online total. “It’s been slow so far,” Mr. Goedeker said. “It takes some patience and persistence. With a paid ad, you get a return on investment immediately. With content marketing, it takes a while for the search engines to recognize your value.” The number of links back to the company’s website increased from 3,000 in late 2013 to 40,000 today; one blog post,  But questions remain, both inside Goedeker’s and in the marketing world at large, about how best to do content marketing, and whether its return justifies the effort. Of course, content marketing doesn’t make sense for all businesses. Some just don’t have the skills, and many have no idea where to begin. In 2012 and 2013, the online custom shirt company  The company had two problems: Its clients weren’t looking for content, and it didn’t have the time or expertise to produce it well. “We’re good at building a supply chain in Asia or a web strategy or producing custom fit shirts but not at creating great content,” Mr. Bi said. “And thinking about our customer, they weren’t looking for us to be GQ but for us to correct a fit problem. They weren’t looking for getting a lot of advice from us.” Those problems, especially the lack of time and expertise, resonate with most small-businesses owners, said Perry Evans, the creator of Perch, an application that helps businesses track social media commentary about them and their competitors. “You’re asking a business to invest the time in something that is not intuitive,” he said. “Small-business people have little time, and they’re not natural writers. It’s a misfit to the personality of a small business.” Marcus Sheridan “That one single article has made us over $2.5 million in sales,” he said. “For a $5 million-a-year company, that’s a ton of business.” For some businesses, content marketing is a way of rebranding and expanding their audience. After buying out his employer two years ago, Mike Adelstein, chief executive of  To do so, Mr. Adelstein began publishing narrative posts about his company’s manufacturing projects, such as  Since Potomac’s content marketing drive began two years ago, annual revenue has grown from $1.8 million to $3 million, Mr. Adelstein said, and the portion that comes from manufacturing has grown from half to 90 percent. Even for larger businesses like Goedeker’s, it can be hard to tell how much actual revenue is generated by a company’s content marketing effort. Because most content marketing pieces aren’t direct sales pitches, they may create more brand awareness than immediate sales. “We haven’t had many conversations, unfortunately,” said Mr. Davids of Goedeker’s, who estimated that 90 percent of the company’s posts were expert commentary aimed at brand awareness while 10 percent dealt with sales and rebates. “We’re more dealing with the top of the funnel. We’re trying to get people to think of us as a resource when they remodel their homes.” Mr. Davids said that the company expected its revenues to grow 25 percent this year, to $60 million; he attributed 1 percent to 3 percent of that growth, or $120,000 to $360,000, directly to content marketing.
