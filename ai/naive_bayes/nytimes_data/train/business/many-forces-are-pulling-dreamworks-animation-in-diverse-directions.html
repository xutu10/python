Many Forces Are Pulling DreamWorks Animation in Diverse Directions
A deal with Hasbro could feed DreamWorks’ need for growth and its push into toys and other merchandise while risking its focus and independence.

LOS ANGELES —  Walt Disney is a big studio built around smaller units: Marvel Entertainment, Pixar and the classic Disney animation shop, among others. Now  As word surfaced late Wednesday of  Mr. Katzenberg declined to be interviewed on Thursday. Reports of the possible deal with Hasbro, along with a possible web television joint venture with Hearst, moved DreamWorks Animation shares up 14.1 percent in Nasdaq trading to close at $25.52 a share, while Hasbro stock fell 4.3 percent on the same exchange to $54.98. Although Hasbro has long wanted to turn itself into a broader entertainment company — a goal that merging with DreamWorks Animation would neatly further — some analysts played down the Hasbro talks. On Thursday, Vasily Karasyov, an analyst at Sterne Agee, pointed to a recently failed attempt by SoftBank, of Japan, to acquire DreamWorks Animation. “It appears that the management is actively looking for a buyer for the company so far (and we think ultimately) unsuccessfully,” Mr. Karasyov said in a research note. With or without Hasbro, DreamWorks Animation — home to the “Shrek,” “Kung Fu Panda” and “Madagascar” series — has been edging toward an identity crisis. Speaking on a panel here last year, Lewis W. Coleman, DreamWorks Animation’s vice chairman, mentioned that one of the company’s chief allies, the Chinese government, perhaps mistakenly saw DreamWorks Animation as chiefly a technology company. The studio’s unit in China was approved by officials as the Shanghai DreamWorks Film and Technology Company, with emphasis on “technology,” he noted. “We’re proud of our technology. We think it’s better than anybody else’s,” Mr. Coleman said. “But it’s not  Nevertheless, a corporate partner, 20th Century Fox, continues to value DreamWorks Animation primarily as a movie supplier. Under an agreement through 2017, Fox distributes DreamWorks Animation’s films — and anticipated three pictures a year when the deal was struck in 2012. A Fox spokesman declined to comment on the possible impact of a DreamWorks-Hasbro deal. A combined Hasbro-DreamWorks could be messy in one regard: Hasbro holds extremely lucrative contracts with Disney, which has long seen DreamWorks Animation as its primary cartoon competitor. (Mr. Katzenberg is a former chairman of Walt Disney Studios.) As a toy partner, Hasbro gets early access to private information about films in Disney’s pipeline. Hasbro controls certain global rights through 2020 to Marvel and “Star Wars” characters, two of Disney’s most important properties. Starting in 2016 — under a new contract — Hasbro will take over the doll license from Mattel for Disney’s “Frozen” and Princess lines. Some analysts estimate that Disney-related sales make up 30 percent of Hasbro’s business. As for Mr. Katzenberg, even before the discussions with Hasbro, he occasionally seemed bent on turning DreamWorks Animation into a consumer products company with a film and television studio in tow. One filmmaker who joined DreamWorks Animation film development meetings in the last year — and who spoke on the condition that he not be named, to preserve industry relationships — recently voiced surprise at the extent to which decisions about a movie’s content and characters were being driven by the toy executives who joined the sessions. Mr. Katzenberg, the filmmaker said, was particularly intent on incorporating product-friendly elements. DreamWorks Animation’s once-crisp sense of self began to fade perhaps five years ago as DVD sales — a mainstay of the company’s original business model — crumpled across the film business. Mr. Katzenberg responded by creating new internal divisions dedicated to diversification: television production, overseas theme parks and, perhaps most important, consumer products. DreamWorks Animation’s presence in the toy aisle (and in licensed merchandise overall) was for a long time surprisingly limited. To save money, the studio never built out a robust consumer products division, instead relying on exclusive retail partners — especially Walmart — to do the heavy lifting. Over the last two years, however, DreamWorks Animation scrambled to build a big consumer products unit. In 2012, the studio had 69 toy and merchandise employees; now there are roughly 200. “How to Train Your Dragon,” released in 2010, had one retail partner; the sequel, released over the summer, had 70. On the same call, Mr. Katzenberg pointed to the merchandising potential of the coming movie “Trolls.” The picture is based on the Troll dolls that were a collecting fad in decades past. “From a consumer products opportunity, without question, it is the biggest title we’ve ever had,” Mr. Katzenberg said. While DreamWorks Animation is tugged by Fox toward film, by China toward technology and, potentially, by Hasbro toward toys, the studio’s core business — computer animated family entertainment — continues to struggle with an identity crisis of its own. Once special, it is now commonplace: Every major studio has a computer animation division. And children and families have shown signs of moving toward more aggressive forms of animation — superhero movies, which, although not typically characterized as cartoons, rely heavily on the same computer-generated imagery. Those pressures contributed to write-downs on three of the company’s last four films: “Rise of the Guardians,” “Mr. Peabody & Sherman” and “Turbo.” Only “The Croods” was a hit, taking in $587 million worldwide. “Movies are not a growth business,” Mr. Katzenberg said in controversy-stirring remarks at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in April. The declaration apparently reflected his new focus — not on film, exactly, but on the bottom line.
