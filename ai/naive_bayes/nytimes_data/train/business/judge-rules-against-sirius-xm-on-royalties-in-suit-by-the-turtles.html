Sirius XM Has Setback In Lawsuit 
Judge Colleen McMahon of United States District Court in Manhattan said the 1960s band the Turtles had rights to its recordings under New York State law.

A federal judge in New York has ruled against  Sirius XM and  Last year, members of the 1960s band the Turtles — who sang hits like “Happy Together” and “She’d Rather Be With Me” — sued Sirius XM in California, New York and Florida, saying that by playing its songs without permission, the broadcaster had infringed on the group’s rights under state laws. The Turtles sought class-action status and asked for $100 million in damages. But these cases may well have broader implications if they lead to changes in copyright law. On Friday, Judge Colleen McMahon of United States District Court in Manhattan rejected Sirius XM’s motion for summary judgment, saying the Turtles have performing rights to their recordings under New York State law. Sirius XM has until Dec. 5 to dispute remaining facts in the case, the judge wrote, otherwise Sirius XM will be ruled liable for infringement. “In short, general principles of common law copyright dictate that public performance rights in pre-1972 sound recordings do exist,” Judge McMahon wrote. A representative of Sirius XM declined on Sunday to comment on the decision. The ruling comes after a separate win for the Turtles in September, when a federal judge in California found Sirius XM liable for infringement under state laws there. That decision was viewed as a major victory for artists and record companies, although its wider impact was unclear because it applied only to California. Judge McMahon’s decision bolstered the music industry’s position that old recordings are covered under state laws. But both recording and broadcasting executives say the potential for wide confusion over music licensing — for example, it may mean that thousands of AM-FM radio stations, as well as restaurants or sports arenas where music is performed, may have been infringing on recording rights for decades — may require clarification from Congress. The cases also come as record sales have continued to decline and the music industry has become more reliant on income from online and streaming audio services. SoundExchange, a nonprofit organization that collects recording royalties from Internet and satellite radio, estimates that about $60 million is lost each year in uncollected royalties from oldies.
