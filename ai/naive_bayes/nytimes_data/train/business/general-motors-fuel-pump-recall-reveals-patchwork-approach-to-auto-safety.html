General Motors’ Fuel Pump Recall Reveals Patchwork Approach to Auto Safety
Under regional recalls, carmakers limit notification and repairs to specific states or regions based on factors, like extreme heat, that cause a part to fail.

In July 2013, an angry and worried Connecticut owner of a 2007 Chevrolet Equinox wrote federal regulators to complain about a gasoline leak that a dealer refused to repair under a recall. The reason, General Motors argued, was that Connecticut did not get hot enough. The Equinox owner differed. “Several heat waves in Connecticut causing crack in fuel pump module,” the owner wrote the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “Not on recall list per G.M. However, should be for any safety issue such as this. Afraid to drive. Huge cost to fix.” Without any objection from federal safety regulators, G.M. had recalled only about 41,000 vehicles sold or registered in some states that have hot weather. That included the Equinox in Arizona, California, Nevada and Texas, where, the automaker said, a “state-by-state analysis” of warranty claims showed cracks in the fuel pump module were most likely to occur. The Equinox recall is an example of what is known in the industry as a regional recall — repairs that are done on a limited, geographic basis. Automakers began such recalls in the 1980s. The idea is that special factors — like extreme heat or extensive use of road salt — cause a crucial part to fail. Automakers argue that it makes no sense to repair vehicles elsewhere, and federal safety officials typically go along. For roughly three decades, regional recalls have frustrated automobile owners who have found it difficult to navigate the patchwork approach to fixing safety problems. The recalls have also been a focus of consumer advocacy groups, which complain that they save automakers millions of dollars while running the risk that, in a mobile society, some dangerous vehicles will not be fixed. Advocacy groups have tried unsuccessfully to eliminate regional recalls. “It is irrational and harms the safety and economic well-being of the American people,” said Brian Wolfman, a visiting professor at Stanford Law School who studies consumer protection issues. Regional recalls amount “to manufacturer discrimination against certain customers based on where they live, even if they have the problem,” said Jack Gillis, a spokesman for the Consumer Federation of America. In the case of the Equinox, General Motors extended a warranty on the fuel pump to other states. But in a full recall, all of the pumps would be replaced. Under the extended warranty, a consumer would have to have a vehicle that leaked — and a fire danger — to receive help. Even so, some owners, like the one in Connecticut, told the agency the dealer refused to make repairs free. “I had to pay to get it fixed,” the owner of a 2007 Equinox from Michigan wrote in December 2013. The major automakers did not answer email messages seeking a response to criticism of regional recalls. Wade Newton, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, did not respond directly to the criticism that regional recalls benefit automakers financially while some owners may not get a needed repair. Instead, Mr. Newton wrote by email, “What’s most important here is that any recalled vehicle is quickly repaired.” Alan Adler, a G.M. spokesman, said regional recalls were “an option we would consider when appropriate, such as a corrosion case where vehicles in cold weather/road salt use states would be more susceptible to an issue,” But Mr. Adler said by email that owners who had the problem in other states could still get a free repair. The highway traffic safety agency’s policy is that “safety-related defects must be remedied on a nationwide basis, unless the manufacturer can justify a limited geographic scope,” Karen Aldana, a spokeswoman, wrote by email. “Any regional recall will be scrutinized and monitored to ensure that the regional scope is sufficient and does not need to be expanded.” No agency officials were made available to discuss regional recalls. One of the country’s largest current regional recalls is taking place in only two states and two territories: In June, nine automakers recalled about 900,000 vehicles in Florida, Hawaii, the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico to repair air bags, made by Takata Corporation, that can rupture, sending shrapnel flying into the cabin. It is the latest in  Takata officials cited high humidity in Florida, Hawaii and the two territories that may set off the air bag’s propellant in a crash and rupture its casing. Millions of vehicles in other states, though, may have the same problem, and will not be fixed. Even Honda, one of the automakers involved, was skeptical of the reasoning. “The whole Gulf of Mexico region exhibits a combination of high absolute humidity and high temperatures,” Chris Martin, a Honda spokesman, wrote by email. Honda greatly expanded its recall beyond the 420,000 in the two states, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands and is now recalling an additional 2.4 million vehicles registered or first sold in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and California. The Takata regional recall “is simply the latest manifestation of a problem that has existed for a long time, and I don’t think it has served the American people well,” said David C. Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law and former director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. The safety agency is going along with Takata’s recommendations but will take “appropriate action” if a wider recall seems warranted, Ms. Aldana, the spokeswoman, wrote by email. A Takata spokesman, Alby Berman, declined to answer questions. A lawsuit to prohibit automakers from issuing recalls only in certain areas was unsuccessful. In 2004, Public Citizen, represented by lawyers including Mr. Wolfman, joined the Center for Auto Safety in a suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the safety agency. It claimed federal regulators were required to fix all vehicles. “By allowing automakers to treat identical vehicles from neighboring states differently, N.H.T.S.A. is endangering the public,” the suit said. Lawyers for the safety agency disagreed and won. The judge concluded that the law “envisions the agency will exercise its discretion to determine whether a safety-related defect exists in a given scenario.” Since that decision, regional recalls have increased, although they remain a tiny fraction of total recalls. In the decade ending in 2002, there were 39 regional recalls, according to the federal court case. But since 2003 at least 14 million vehicles have been covered in at least 60 regional recalls. About two-thirds of them occurred since 2009, according to a Times analysis of  It is unclear how many injuries or deaths, if any, have resulted from defects covered by regional recalls. The highway traffic safety agency does not keep a tally of regional recalls, Ms. Aldana, the agency spokeswoman, wrote by email. Even though a federal judge ruled that regional recalls were legal, it is still wrong for the agency to allow automakers to issue them, said Rosemary Shahan, the president of  “Cars don’t stay in the same place — cars move; people move,” Ms. Shahan said in an interview. “So, the idea that they only pose a threat in a certain part of the country is fundamentally wrong.”
