Marriott and Hilton Announce Penalty for Last-Minute Cancellations
Marriott and Hilton recently announced they would charge a penalty if a guest canceled a reservation at the last minute.

IN recent years, the airline industry has generated billions in revenue by charging fees on top of base fares. Now the hotel industry seems to be having the same idea. Two worldwide hotel companies,  Effective Jan. 1, those days are gone at the two chains. The companies say that if you don’t cancel your reservation by the day before your scheduled arrival, you’ll be charged a penalty of one night’s room rate. “We’re making this change so we can provide you with a more consistent booking process and make more rooms available for when you need last-minute travel accommodations,”  Even hotels within large chains have varying cancellation policies, and the changes planned by Marriott and Hilton address only those last-minute cancellation rules. Policies won’t change for hotels that already have cancellation policies requiring a two-day, four-day or even longer advance notice. “Some hotels have more restrictive policies in place, so please refer to your individual conformations to verify their policy,” Hilton said. I’d say it’s likely that other hotel companies will adopt similar changes, especially as they evaluate the success airlines have had in raising additional fee revenue, which is often called ancillary revenue. For example, most airlines charge a $200 fee to cancel and rebook most coach tickets — and those fees sure do add up. In 2013, domestic airlines earned $2.81 billion from cancellation penalty fees, up sharply in five years from $1.67 billion in 2008. Over all, airlines in the United States raised about $14.3 billion in ancillary revenue last year,  Domestic hotels generated about $163 billion in revenue last year, according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association, compared with about $199.7 billion in revenue for domestic airlines, according to Transportation Department data. But hotels are nowhere near as aggressive as airlines in charging extra fees to customers — not that they aren’t making an effort. Hotels in the United States will accrue a record total of $2.25 billion in fees and surcharges this year, according to a forecast by Bjorn Hanson at the New York University Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. That’s up from $1.55 billion five years ago in 2009. Included in that revenue are fees for in-room Wi-Fi, “resort fees” of $40 from many so-called resort hotels, and reservation cancellations fees. One trend driving hotels to tighten cancellation policies is that cancellation rates have been rising. “Part of the issue is that business travelers are canceling more than they did previously,” Dr. Hanson said. Policies allowing a reservation to be canceled as late as 6 p.m. on the arrival date have been standard in many business hotels for more than a decade. But gradually, some hotels have been requiring more notice — and in some cases raising the cancellation penalty. While the penalty for canceling past the deadline is a single night’s rate at most city and suburban hotels, “at some resorts it might be three nights. And at some destinations it’s the entire stay,” he said. Like many business travelers, I often change travel plans. I was recently charged one night’s stay — $271.56 — at the Rosen Centre Hotel in Orlando, Fla., when I canceled on the day I was supposed to arrive to attend the National Business Aviation Association convention. The hotel’s policy was that cancellations for that event required advance notice of 72 hours. Given that rooms were difficult to find near the convention center, I assumed the Rosen could readily resell my room, but at least the policy was clear when I booked the stay. Cancellation policies often change, just as room rates usually do, depending on anticipated demand. When I checked on Sunday, a room at the Rosen for Dec. 2 and Dec. 3 was $237.50 a night, with a one-day cancellation policy. But again, that policy was clearly explained. Unlike the airline industry, the hotel business is diverse and competitive. There are about 53,000 hotels with a total of almost five million rooms in the United States, according to the American Hotel and Lodging Association, which estimates that business travelers account for 41 percent of hotel stays. Hotel occupancy is “at an all-time high, at least since 1988,” said Robert Mandelbaum, director of research information at PKF Hospitality Research. After a slump during the economic crisis, by the end of 2015 the demand for rooms will have increased by more than 25 percent since 2009, while the supply will have increased by only 5.6 percent, according to a recent forecast by PKF Hospitality Research. “The pendulum has swung to the hotel side,” Mr. Mandelbaum said. “They now have much more ability to dictate prices and policies.”
