HBO will try to repeat the success of its mini-series “True Detective” this season with two more stars with long Hollywood credits: Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn have signed to be the team that follows Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. The second edition of “True Detective,” once again written by Nic Pizzolatto, will begin production this fall. Mr. Farrell, known for such films as “In Bruges” and “Seven Psychopaths,” will play a detective walking the line between corrupt police officials and a mob boss. Mr. Vaughn, mostly know for comic roles in films like “Wedding Crashers” and “Delivery Man,” will play a criminal whose plans to go straight are upended by the murder of his business partner.
