Low Sales Drag Down Drug Makers’ Shares
Lower-than-expected sales of the most important drugs manufactured by Sanofi and Gilead Sciences affected the share price of the drug companies.

Shares of Sanofi and  Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical giant, delivered the greatest surprise. It said that its biggest-selling drug, the Lantus insulin product, had been hit by sharp price competition in the United States, slowing its sales growth. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers are now trying harder to pit pharmaceutical companies  Chris Viehbacher, the chief executive of Sanofi, said the company obtained good insurance coverage for Lantus but had to offer discounts to counteract a competitor, which he did not name but which was probably Novo Nordisk. “None of us are going to have a return on investment if there is a race to the bottom,” he told analysts in a conference call. Lantus had sales of 1.567 billion euros, or about $2 billion, in the third quarter, accounting for about 18 percent of Sanofi’s total sales of €8.781 billion and far more than any other single drug. In the United States, Lantus sales were up 5.8 percent in the third quarter to €1.042 billion, or $1.32 billion. But that was a much slower rate of growth than earlier in the year. And Sanofi said that because of the discounting its overall diabetes sales would not grow at all next year. Sanofi’s American depositary receipts fell 9 percent to $48.07. The news came after a report by the French newspaper Les Echos on Monday that some members of Sanofi’s board were thinking about replacing Mr. Viehbacher for a variety of reasons, including that he had moved to Boston. The newspaper published a letter from Mr. Viehbacher to the board, which argued why he should not be dismissed. Sanofi’s board issued a statement on Monday saying that Mr. Viehbacher’s succession was not on the agenda of its meeting that day. Gilead reported after the markets closed Tuesday that its blockbuster hepatitis C drug Sovaldi achieved second-quarter sales of $2.8 billion, with $2.2 billion in the United States. That was somewhat less than analysts had predicted, and Gilead shares were down about 4 percent in after-hours trading. The third-quarter Sovaldi sales were down from $3.5 billion in the second quarter, of which $3 billion was in the United States. A decline was expected because many patients were holding off on treatment waiting for an even better Gilead drug, Harvoni, which was approved this month. Sovaldi, which was approved in December, is still on pace to become one of the best-selling drugs in the world in only its rookie season. It accounted for nearly half of Gilead’s product revenue of $6 billion in the third quarter. Medicaid But when AbbVie wins approval of its hepatitis C treatment, expected by year end, the payers hope to do what they have succeeded in doing with Lantus and other diabetes drugs — play one manufacturer against another to wring discounts.
