Michelle Munson of Aspera, on Always Respecting the Opportunity
For the chief executive of the Aspera unit of IBM, respecting an opportunity means embracing it and dedicating yourself to making the most of it.

This interview with  Q. Were you in leadership roles when you were younger? A. I was raised on a wheat and cattle farm in Kansas. My mother is a retired professor, and my father is a fifth-generation leader of our farm. The combination of the two of them framed the way my brother and I were raised. They emphasized two things. One was education, and the other was participating in 4-H, the community-based leadership organization. We both ended up learning public speaking and group leadership. That led us to be very responsible early on. Our interest in entrepreneurship came from watching our dad emphasize productivity and creation over having a set career path. My mom and dad were comfortable with risk and trying new things, and they pushed us to work outside our comfort zone. My mother was interested in technology. She was adamant about getting a personal computer in the early 1980s. Tell me about your college years. I started in chemical engineering and switched to electrical engineering and physics. I was also very involved in student leadership. Then I got a Fulbright and went to Cambridge for my graduate studies in computer science. After Cambridge, I uprooted myself and moved to California for a research job with IBM. I ended up joining a start-up from there, and I co-founded Aspera 10 years ago. How has your leadership style evolved? I’ve made my share of mistakes. But the most important lesson I learned is that there is a degree of forgiveness from people you work with if your intentions are right and you follow through. Because I’ve been sincere, the team has forgiven my mistakes along the way. That’s given me peace of mind and confidence to keep evolving. Maturity has also helped. When I started the company I was 31; now I’m 41. In that time, I married and had a child — transformational personal experiences that help you to grow outside yourself and be able to stand in other people’s shoes. Another lesson — which is probably quite obvious, but wasn’t obvious to me early on — is that not everyone values the same things I do. Some things are universal, like the gratification of achievement, but other things are not, like work styles. I have backed off and allowed people to work the way they do best. How do you hire? We look for two fundamentals. The first is a high degree of competence in the person’s domain. The second is strong character. For us that means the person’s values, sense of responsibility, desire and drive, honesty and genuineness. We want to understand their intentions and why they want to be part of our team. And how do you assess character? We drill in and assess what they said they did in their career. What was the thought process? The challenges? What impact did they have? What did they take away from it? Usually that’s very revealing. We also give them questions that take them a bit out of their comfort zone. They’re not brain teasers — they’re in their field, and they should be able to deal with them, but many have more than one correct answer. We’ll often have them do the work in front of us to get a sense of their competence and authenticity. We rarely have disagreements about a candidate. The hardest thing is to walk away from a candidate with potential. But it’s important to set the bar high so we end up with a contributor who can really help move the team forward. There’s a fine tipping point in an organization between moving the organization forward and functioning well but tipping it back the other direction. People will respond to their peers, so I pay a lot of attention to that, and the other people in the organization do as well. What’s it like to work for you? On the positive side, I’m really easy to work with — I value people achieving, digging in and going after a goal. If it’s valuable and they do it, I admire that intrinsically. Gold stars forever. My biggest pet peeve is people who don’t respect the opportunity they have. It’s the opposite of what I just said. To me, respecting an opportunity means embracing it and dedicating yourself to making the most of it. I am infuriated by people who waste the opportunity. What career and life advice do you give to college seniors? No. 1: competence. Nothing, nothing, nothing replaces being competent in what you’re doing, and that comes with respect for opportunity. You cannot respect an opportunity if you don’t know what you’re doing. For a college student, that means getting really good at what you do in your field, whatever that field is. I do not subscribe to the idea that young people should emphasize people skills. The world is not just a social network. If you’re in politics, that may need to be your primary specialty, but the No. 1 driver for somebody’s role, respect from others and for your ability to contribute, is what you can do that’s of value. The second thing is critical thinking, which leads to independent thinking, and that comes from a diverse education and stretching yourself with independent-study internships and outside projects and activities. It can come in many forms, but it is paramount to have that in combination with skill and competence in your field, because that’s what allows you to create. You can’t create unless you have some ability to discern what is lacking or needed or doesn’t exist, and that goes beyond being a critic. It’s very easy to criticize. The real challenge is, how are you going to solve it? How are you going to make it better, with whatever resources you have?
