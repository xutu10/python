Nikki Finke, Hollywood Chronicler, Said to Be in Talks With Politico
The former writer for Deadline Hollywood is looking for other jobs, people familiar with the situation said.

Politico has been in talks to hire the Hollywood journalist Nikki Finke to write about Washington as a political columnist, people familiar with the discussions said Friday. Ms. Finke has visited Washington to meet with senior Politico staff, but has not committed to the move, said the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were continuing. She has also been in talks with other publications, including the New York Observer, for several months. Ms. Finke grew infamous in Los Angeles for aggressive coverage of the entertainment industry, which made her former website, Deadline Hollywood, into a draw for breaking industry news. Penske Media acquired the site in 2009. But in 2012 it purchased Variety, a competing Hollywood trade publication, which sparked a dispute that resulted in Ms. Finke’s leaving the company. Ms. Finke and Penske recently came to settlement terms, which prohibited her from writing about the entertainment industry for another company. Writing about Washington might circumnavigate that agreement. Ms. Finke and Politico had no immediate comment.
