New York’s the Place to Be, an Agency Says 
The agency, 72andSunny, the Agency of the Year in Advertising Age and Adweek, is coming to New York.

IN another sign that New York is  The agency is  The principals of 72andSunny plan on Wednesday to take the wraps off their presence in New York, where the agency has 30 employees and 10 to 15 freelancers working for two clients, Samsung and Smirnoff vodka, in office space on the top two floors of 30 Cooper Square in the East Village. Until now, the executives had been in stealth or beta mode in New York, awaiting an appropriate moment to raise the flag. “We started thinking about New York at least three years ago,” said John Boiler, partner and chief executive of 72andSunny, and that consideration accelerated along with the agency’s growth. “The challenge we’ve had is getting the best talent in the world, and the talent is in New York,” he added. “First and foremost, it’s a talent play.” The agency also employs about 430 men and women in Los Angeles and an additional 85 in Amsterdam. In deciding to enter New York, 72andSunny is joining a lengthy list of agencies that are testing their mettle in what is the nation’s — and arguably, the world’s — most crowded and competitive ad market. Recent entrants include  (Then there are all the agencies that have long called New York home, among them BBDO, DDB, Grey, McCann Erickson, J. Walter Thompson and Y&R.;) Expanding to New York has yielded decided mixed results for agencies based elsewhere. Some New York outposts have thrived. Some have muddled through or stumbled along. Some, like the New York office of the London agency M&C; Saatchi, opened, closed and reopened. And some, like the New York office of the  “We’re entering New York with a healthy dose of humility,” said Matt Jarvis, partner and chief strategy office of 72andSunny. “One thing that’s made us successful over the last decade is a collaborative culture and work style, and we’re excited to bring it to New York,” he added. “We have something to offer, but we also have something to learn.” And 72andSunny seeks to be “inspired by the market,” Mr. Jarvis said, adding that as an agency that is “committed to being in the Zeitgeist,” it is important to have a presence in “one of the great culture engines, where culture is made on a daily basis.” To help improve the chances that the new venture will be successful, 72andSunny chose two leaders for the New York office who provide what executives hope are complementary résumés. One, James Townsend, managing director of the office, has experience with 72andSunny, transferring from Los Angeles after working there for three years, most recently as managing director. The other, Guillermo Vega, executive creative director of the office, is new to 72andSunny, joining from the São Paulo, Brazil, office of Wieden & Kennedy, where he was executive creative director. In New York, “there are brands we can work with, companies we can partner with” that are not readily available as collaborators elsewhere, said Mr. Townsend, who is 38. And just as 72andSunny “feeds off technology and entertainment” in Los Angeles and “has a truly European, international vibe” in Amsterdam, he added, the new office will “draft off” the unique qualities of New York. Also, “like a lot of agencies, we lose people to New York, and try to get people from New York, all the time,” Mr. Townsend said. “Access to talent is huge for us.” Mr. Vega, 42, was asked about a sentiment in an Adweek article about M&C; Saatchi’s reopening in New York, declaring that New York “needs another agency like it needs another restaurant.” Mr. Vega replied: “There are restaurants everywhere. But people open restaurants still.” “One of the most important things we talked about when opening this office was bringing our culture, our philosophy, some of the 72andSunny DNA, to New York,” he said. The agency’s presence in New York began six to eight months ago with about 20 employees working in space in a building on Fifth Avenue where parent MDC has an office. “Miles said it was fun having the good energy there,” Mr. Boiler said, referring to Miles S. Nadal, chairman and chief executive of MDC, “but I’m sure it was disruptive.” The 72andSunny office space at 30 Cooper Square, rented with a 10-year lease, is about 13,000 square feet. The agency also has the option to develop a deck on the roof.
