Virginia Sues Trinity Industries Over Potentially Risky Guardrail
The state is the first governmental entity to participate in whistle-blower lawsuits against the guardrail manufacturer, Trinity Industries.

Virginia is suing the guardrail maker  The suit makes Virginia the first governmental entity to participate in whistle-blower suits against Trinity, which is based in Dallas. The suits were brought on behalf of state and federal governments, but none of those entities, until now, have been plaintiffs. In October, a jury found that Trinity had defrauded the federal government when it did not inform the Federal Highway Administration of changes it made to the guardrail, the ET-Plus, in 2005. The company sold the guardrails to state governments, which, in turn, received federal reimbursement. The jury returned with  On Thursday, Mark R. Herring, the attorney general of Virginia, filed a complaint in Richmond Circuit Court, seeking civil penalties and the recovery of costs if tests show that the products are unsafe and must be replaced. The tests began this week in San Antonio in conjunction with the highway administration. “It is shocking that a company would think they could secretly modify a safety device in a way that may actually pose a threat to Virginia motorists,” he said. “Trinity had an obligation to test and seek approval for its equipment, but instead, they sold the commonwealth thousands of unapproved products that had not been properly tested to ensure they would keep motorists safe.” Trinity said it would defend itself against Virginia’s lawsuit. “Trinity did not commit fraud against the Commonwealth of Virginia,” said Jeff Eller, a spokesman for Trinity. He said it was “conducting the eight tests requested by the F.H.W.A., which includes the two tests specifically requested by Virginia,” and had “given them all the data they have requested.” In addition to the Virginia case, a separate lawsuit was filed by counties in Illinois. Prosecutors in Hamilton and Macon counties sued Trinity in federal court on Nov. 26 on behalf of all Illinois counties, accusing the company of a “fraudulent cover up” and deceptive trade practices, court records show. Eric Holland, a special assistant state’s attorney assigned to the case, said the ET-Plus represents a pressing public safety issue, and he expected that other jurisdictions would also take action. “I think any public entity that has this particular guardrail on their property has concerns,” Mr. Holland said. Mr. Eller declined to comment on the Illinois case, but said the company was reviewing it. Virginia and more than 30 other states have banned the guardrail products, which are suspected of having a defect that could make them jam. When that happens, the rail can pierce a vehicle. More than a dozen other private lawsuits blame the guardrails for five deaths and more injuries. In October, after the federal jury verdict, Virginia’s Transportation Department threatened to remove the guardrails if Trinity did not do more tests. Soon after, the federal highway agency required further testing. The rail head is the flat piece of steel at the front of the guardrail that, on impact, is supposed to glide along the rail and push the metal safely out of the way. In 2005, without notifying the highway agency, Trinity narrowed the channel behind the head to four inches from five, possibly causing the mechanism to malfunction, state officials have said. Highway administration authorities said they learned about Trinity’s design changes in 2012 from Joshua Harman, a competitor of ?? Trinity. Mr. Harman discovered Trinity’s undisclosed redesign during litigation in 2011 and subsequently filed the federal lawsuit against the company on behalf of the highway agency under the False Claims Act. Though he is a competitor, he is a whistle-blower under the law. The day after the jury returned the fraud verdict in the federal case, the highway agency called for Trinity to do more guardrail tests. The agency had  On Wednesday, Trinity did the first of eight initial tests overseen by the agency. A second test, set for Thursday, was delayed until Friday because of weather. The test involved a pickup truck crashed into an ET-Plus at a 15-degree angle. Tony Furst, the federal agency’s associate administrator for safety, stressed that the initial testing was only “one step of many,” and that the agency’s goal was to first “re-baseline the device” by ensuring the original new-to-market tests done by Trinity in 2005 were conducted properly, after concerns were raised over their soundness. The federal agency could still order more targeted testing aimed at investigating the alleged defect. Mr. Furst said federal officials have also begun analyzing information on ET-Plus incidents from around the country, including records from individual victims’ accidents, which he said had been provided by lawyers for the federal whistleblower. Until recently, the agency had yet to examine such evidence. Virginia officials attended Wednesday’s test, but Trinity did not allow them to inspect the ET-Plus test unit before the crash. Only federal officials were provided such access, according to a company spokesman. Virginia had also originally asked that Trinity test guardrail units that were actually installed on roads, being used in service. The units used in Wednesday’s test, and planned for the next seven crash tests, came from the inventory of the California Department of Transportation, not from the state’s roads, Mr. Furst said Wednesday.A second test, set for Thursday, was delayed until Friday because of weather.
