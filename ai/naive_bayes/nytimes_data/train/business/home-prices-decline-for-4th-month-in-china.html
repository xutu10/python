BEIJING — Prices for new homes in China fell in August for a fourth consecutive month, and declines spread to a record number of cities, government data showed Thursday, underlining a deepening downward trend in the property market that is increasingly weighing on the broader economy. The data, released by the National Bureau of Statistics, showed that the prices had fallen in 68 of the 70 major cities it monitors, up from 64 in July. “Home prices dropped on a monthly basis in most cities in August, but some of them saw easing price falls,” Liu Jianwei, a senior statistician at the bureau, said in a statement accompanying the data. Prices slipped 0.9 percent in August in Beijing, easing from a month-on-month drop of 1 percent in July, while prices in Shanghai fell 1.1 percent in August, the fourth month-on-month fall in a row, though not as fast as a decline of 1.2 percent in July. The string of monthly price declines is now close to wiping out gains made over the past year, which could further weaken buying interest and dampen consumer confidence. Price declines deepened on a monthly basis in smaller cities, including the eastern city of Jinhua, where home prices fell 1.7 percent, accelerating from a drop of 0.8 percent in July. Official transaction data showed sale numbers' picking up slightly in August from July. Industry observers believe the downturn could persist in coming months because of high inventories and pessimistic market sentiment. Government data last weekend showed the square footage of property sold rose 5 percent in August from July, though the figure was still 12.4 percent down from a year before. After a strong performance in 2013, China’s real estate market has softened as sales have slowed and banks have become increasingly cautious about lending to developers and home buyers. In the face of sluggish sales, China Vanke, the country’s largest residential developer, has teamed up with Taobao, the Alibaba-owned online shopping site, to offer discounts of as much as 2 million renminbi, or $325,000, to customers who buy property on the site. More than 30 local governments have acted to support the troubled property sector by easing restrictions on home purchases in recent months. “Home prices are likely to drop further in coming months, as developers need to offer deeper price cuts to attract home buyers to enter the market,” said Lin Bo, deputy head of research at China Real Estate Information, a property data provider in Shanghai. “Compared to a year ago, we expect prices to go negative by the end of this year or earlier next year.” In the last downturn, in early 2012, China started to see year-on-year house price declines after five consecutive monthly drops. Some economists believe the current slump could last much longer given far higher inventories of unsold homes. Developers will face intensive competition in September and October with more new developments introduced in the traditional peak season, analysts said. Moody’s Investors Service said on Wednesday that developers’ profit margins were expected to continue to be weak, as China’s property prices are likely to remain under pressure for the rest of the year with strong supply from new projects in the second half of 2014. Real estate, which directly affects a variety of business sectors in China, was seen as a heavy brake on economic activity in official data, released last weekend, showing that factory output grew in Augusts at its slackest pace in six years. Other August data showed that China’s economic growth appeared to hit a soft patch after a bounce in June.
