Airlines Use Fuel Windfall to Pursue Premium Flier
The companies have little interest in using the money saved from cheaper fuel to improve life in the cheap seats. The focus is instead on the high-revenue-producing business traveler.

I HAVE occasionally suggested here that business travelers on exhausting international trips ought to be able to fly in the comfort of business class, or at least in premium-economy cabins with more legroom and better service than in the squalor of coach. This suggestion irritates some frugal corporate travel managers. Airlines, on the other hand, love to hear this. Around the world, as they accumulate record profits and hail the sharp drop in oil prices, airlines are spending billions to make their premium-cabin products — chiefly business class, but also first class — more attractive to corporate travelers. There seems to be an assumption that lower energy prices generally are putting more disposable income into travelers’ pockets, while loosening up some corporate policies on flying in premium classes. “We have seen a really big increase in business-class travel,” said Peter Vlitas, the senior vice president for airline sales and marketing at Protravel International, a travel management company. The improving economy is a reason, as well as that more people are traveling internationally, often on longer multicity trips. “They might be going from the U.S. into London, but coming back out of Paris after a side trip to Germany,” he said. Six or seven years ago, a typical last-minute business-class round-trip fare from New York to London was about $11,000. Now, with abundant capacity and robust competition, those fares are generally $6,500 to $7,000, and travel agents can negotiate lower prices for big corporate buyers. The top argument for allowing business class is productivity. “If we’re talking going to Europe in a coach seat, they arrive at six or seven in the morning and are expected to start work right away,” Mr. Vlitas said. “Then we see in our surveys that they tend to be pretty good till maybe 11 in the morning, but after that they hit a brick wall.” Some companies that do approve business-class travel do so only in one direction, however. “To save money, the company might send them over in business class, and then on the way back home put them in a premium-economy seat,” he said. Airlines are rejoicing at the drop in fuel costs, while they anticipate record profits and spend lavishly on improving their higher-price products. At the same time, they are devoting scant marketing attention to the cheap-seat fliers. In an investor conference last week with stock market analysts,  Customer segmentation is a fancy way of saying, We don’t want to compete for basic market share; we have little interest in growing capacity; and we’ll concentrate on the highest-revenue producers, especially those sitting in the front of the plane. It seems that airlines also expect to see more of what one analyst at the Delta conference said was a “windfall” in consumer wealth created by lower energy prices. Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s chief revenue officer, was running with the theme last week. “It’s very interesting to think about not only what lower fuel prices does to the airline, but what it does to the consumer and what they intend to do with their savings from lower fuel prices,” Mr. Hauenstein said at the conference. Delta is forecasting a profit of $5 billion next year, buttressed by an estimated $1.5 billion savings on fuel. Younger travelers especially are open to buying higher-end travel, Mr. Hauenstein told the analysts. “If we think about what the millennials are doing, and what people are generally doing, you don’t see them buying T-shirts. You don’t see them running to the malls; you don’t see them buying short-term goods. You don’t see them buying durable goods. Millennials want experiences,” he said. “What are they spending money on? They’re spending it on entertainment and travel.” All of the major domestic airlines are slicing and dicing their fare structures, their loyalty programs and their coach cabins, to focus on those who fly a lot and spend more, rather than those who just fly a lot on cheap fares. Delta, for example, in a  That’s clearly an attempt to say that business class is the new first class, though of course some airlines, among them Emirates and Etihad Airways, are setting new levels of extravagance in their first-class cabins. An Etihad A380, for example, has  Those of us back in Row 34 will wonder why drastically lower fuel costs do not translate to lower basic fares. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, in fact,  “Not only have they caught up with the other premium carriers,” he said, “but they are now leading the charge.”
