Drop in Aircraft Demand Sends Durable Goods Orders Down for August
After a strong July, a fall in commercial aircraft orders weighed down the numbers. Unemployment benefit applications also rose last week.

WASHINGTON — Coming off a strong July, business orders for long-lasting manufactured goods fell significantly in August, dragged lower by a plunge in demand for commercial aircraft. Orders in an important category that tracks business investment plans posted a gain. Durable goods orders fell 18.2 percent in August, after a 22.5 percent increase in July, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. Both the big increase and the big drop were records, reflecting a sharp swing in demand for commercial aircraft, which is an extremely volatile category that can skew overall results. Airplane orders fell 74.3 percent in August. However, the crucial category that serves as a proxy for business plans for investment rose 0.6 percent. Manufacturing production has been a source of strength for the economy this year, and economists are looking for this to continue. In addition, the Labor Department said Thursday that the number of people seeking unemployment aid increased last week after falling sharply two weeks ago. Weekly unemployment benefit applications rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000. Despite the rise, the level of applications remains near pre-recession levels, a sign hiring will remain healthy. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell for the second straight week to 298,500. In durable goods orders, economists are looking for businesses to step up spending to expand and modernize their operations, a move that will help economic growth. In addition to the decline in demand for commercial aircraft, orders for motor vehicles and parts also fell, declining 6.4 percent after a 10 percent increase in July. The August dip was expected to be temporary, given automakers’ strong sales gains this year. Excluding the volatile transportation category, orders would have risen 0.7 percent in August after a 0.5 percent drop outside of transportation in July. Industries showing higher demand in August included machinery, where orders rose 0.7 percent, and electrical equipment and appliances, where orders rose 3.1 percent. A separate report from the Federal Reserve showed that manufacturing output declined 0.4 percent in August, marking the first decline in seven months. The drop in production came from a sharp fall in production at auto plants, due mainly to seasonal adjustment issues. Broad increases in manufacturing this year have pointed to stronger growth across the economy, suggesting that manufacturers expect business investment and consumer spending to improve in the coming months. A closely watched index compiled by the Institute for Supply Management showed that manufacturing rose to the highest level in more than three years. The ISM manufacturing gauge increased to 59 in August, the highest point since March 2011. The index in July was 57.1. Any reading above 50 signals that manufacturing is growing.
