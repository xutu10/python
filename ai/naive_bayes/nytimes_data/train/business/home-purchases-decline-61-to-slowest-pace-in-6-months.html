WASHINGTON —  Fewer Americans bought homes in November as buying slid to its slowest pace in six months. The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that sales of existing homes fell 6.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.93 million. That was down from a revised annual pace of 5.26 million in October. In the last 12 months, sales have risen 2.1 percent. The combination of higher home prices and relatively stagnant incomes has reduced affordability and restrained buying, and a recent decline in mortgage rates has yet to lure more consumers into the market. At the same time, fewer distressed properties and bargains, which tend to attract investors, are coming onto the market. The Realtors estimate that 2014 sales will end up below 2013 levels. Sales have slumped much of this year after a three-year rally that followed the recession and the implosion of the housing market. Harsh weather crippled home buying in early 2014. Lower affordability, resulting from tight credit, rising home prices and essentially flat incomes, suppressed sales for the rest of the year. The Realtors have estimated that 4.94 million existing homes will be sold this year, down 3 percent from 5.09 million in 2013. Analysts say sales of roughly 5.5 million existing homes are common in a healthy real estate market. The median price rose 5 percent over the last 12 months to $205,300. That is good for sellers, but creates an additional challenge for would-be buyers. The share of first-time buyers climbed to 31 percent last month from a recent average of 29 percent. Still, that is well below the 40 percent share that has been typical. November sales fell in all four major geographic regions: Northeast, Midwest, South and West. Purchases fell in the last 12 months for homes valued at less than $250,000. The supply of homes for sale also fell from October. In November, 2.09 million homes were listed for sale, down 6.7 percent from October. Some of the weakness in sales has resulted from a healthier market. Just 9 percent of sales last month were because of  Signs suggest sales may improve in 2015. Mortgage rates have fallen sharply in the last few weeks, which should make homes more affordable. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped last week to 3.8 percent, from 3.93 percent the previous week. That was the lowest level since May 2013. Rates have fallen as investors have plowed their money into 10-year  Sales may also pick up as the housing market continues to heal from the boom-and-bust of the last decade. Zillow, a real estate data provider, said last week that the proportion of homeowners with mortgages who owe more than their house is worth had fallen by almost half in the last two years. Rising prices and foreclosures have reduced that figure. As more homeowners gain equity in their homes, they are more likely to list their homes for sale, keeping home prices in check and spurring more sales. Stan Humphries, Zillow’s chief economist, forecasts that sales of existing homes will rise to 5.2 million next year from just under 5 million in 2014.
