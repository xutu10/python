Vermont Yankee, the state’s only nuclear plant, stopped sending power to the New England grid Monday after more than 42 years. Bill Mohl, the president of Entergy Wholesale Commodities, which owns the plant, said economic factors, especially related to the natural gas market in the Northeast, were the major reasons for the shutdown. Vermont’s governor, Peter Shumlin, said the closing was a positive step. “Today, thanks to investments in renewable energy such as solar, Vermont’s energy future is on a different, more sustainable path that is creating jobs, reducing energy costs for Vermonters and slowing climate change,” he said. The plant will sit for decades while its radioactive components cool and its decommissioning fund grows. It is expected to cost nearly $1.25 billion to dismantle the plant, which likely won’t occur until the 2040s or later.
