For Some Hotel Employees, It’s Home for the Holidays
Some hotels, especially those where business slows down at Christmas, close their doors as a reward to employees.

Hotel employees often do not spend the holidays at home with their families. They are in the travel business, after all, a year-round industry. Recently, though, some hotels have started closing their doors to give employees time off at  The 177-room Adoba Hotel in Rapid City, S.D., had been through a long renovation in 2013 and its general manager, Stacie Hull, wanted to reward her employees as the year came to a close. She decided to close the hotel Dec. 24 and Dec. 25 so employees could spend time with their families. It took some calls to help the approximately 50 guests who had reserved rooms make other arrangements, but it was worth it, she said. The closure was so well received by the staff, she said, that she blocked out those days again this year. “We aren’t part of a chain,” said Chris Donahue, a spokesman for the hotel, “so we don’t have to follow corporate rules like staying open on  Other hotels are joining in. The ones that can afford to are generally independently owned and in markets where business drops off over the holiday. One reason for closing at Christmas is that hotels are increasingly realizing the importance of employee satisfaction, according to Mike Oshins, a hospitality professor at Boston University. Managers recognize that happy employees result in more smiles, more problems solved and better overall service. A hotel’s location usually dictates its ability to close, Professor Oshins said. A hotel in a college town that empties for winter break won’t disappoint many customers if it closes, he said. “If their occupancy rate is 30 percent or less, they may as well give everyone the day off,” he said. Closing in a tourist area, by contrast, will mean the loss of more than just one or two days of business. “When a tourist comes for a week or long weekend, they want to stay at a single property for their entire visit — they aren’t going to check in at one hotel and then leave for another property when it closes,” he said. “A hotel closed on Christmas will lose multiple days of revenue.” Ciro Ciampi owns the Sharnbrook Hotel in Bedfordshire County, Britain, with his siblings and parents. When they opened the hotel in 2006, the family decided to close on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day. At first, guests were not very understanding, Mr. Ciampi said. Now the hotel sends a message explaining the desire of the owners and staff to be home with family when declining a request for Christmas accommodations. “They are more accepting when we explain,” he said. Although it is festive, there is an added pressure on all employees when a hotel is open on Christmas, Mr. Ciampi said. Guests expect more, he said, because they are away from home on a special occasion. “If a hotel doesn’t have the right ambiance — someone dressed as Father Christmas, gifts for the children and all the bells and whistles — they will get complaints or bad reviews online,” he said. Hotels find different ways to accommodate their clientele. At the Arnold House, a nine-room inn on Shandelee Mountain outside Livingston Manor, N.Y., which opened in May, guests can check in on Christmas Eve and keep the hotel room on Christmas Day, but there is no official staffing on that day, and no new guests can check in on Christmas. “It was an interesting dilemma balancing the needs of staff and guests,” said Sims Foster, who owns the hotel with his wife, Kirsten. The hotel chef lives on the property and will provide breakfast for the guests Christmas morning. Mr. Foster said he and his wife would stop by to make sure everyone was O.K. Guests do still get charged. “We called the guests who planned to be here and learned they were all going to be off the property for most of the day, so we think it will work out fine,” Mr. Foster said. In the rarest cases, a big hotel will close. The Amway Grand Plaza Hotel in Grand Rapids, Mich., the largest in the region with 682 rooms, will be closed on Christmas Day. So will the Downtown Courtyard by Marriott in Grand Rapids. Both are owned by Amway Corporation, headquartered in Ada, Mich. The hotel management conducted a trial closure five years ago. “I’ve worked in hospitality a long time, " said Richard Winn, president of the Amway Hotel Corporation. “It is rare to get a holiday off. So we thought this would be a special thing to do for our associates.” The closure went smoothly, so the hotel has made it an annual event. The Downtown Courtyard hotel is part of the Marriott franchise, so Amway Hotel Corporation had to get permission from the Marriott Corporation to close it. The Amway company also owns a J.W. Marriott nearby that will remain open, so reservation workers at the Downtown Courtyard and Amway Grand Plaza refer guests there instead. Grand Rapids is home to more corporate headquarters and universities than tourist attractions, so hotel demand does slow down significantly around the holidays. Mr. Ciampi, of the Sharnbrook Hotel, said: “We welcome guests the other 362 days of the year and give spot-on service then. But on Christmas, I want to have my own family time.”
