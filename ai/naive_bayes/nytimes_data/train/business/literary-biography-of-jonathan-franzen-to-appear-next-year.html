Literary Biography of Jonathan Franzen to Appear Next Year
The author of four novels, Mr. Franzen is the focus of a Swarthmore College English professor who has also studied Faulkner, Proust and Kafka.

Few living novelists get the biography treatment. So why is the scholar Philip Weinstein, who has published critical studies of literary masters like William Faulkner, Marcel Proust and Franz Kafka, writing an in-depth study of the life and work of Jonathan Franzen? At 55, Mr. Franzen has published four novels. Only two, “The Corrections” and “Freedom,” have become critical hits and best sellers. Apart from occasionally acute creative anxiety (Mr. Franzen famously blindfolded himself and used earplugs to concentrate while writing “The Corrections”) and a troubled marriage, Mr. Franzen doesn’t appear to have led an especially noteworthy life. But Mr. Weinstein, an English professor at Swarthmore College (Mr. Franzen’s alma mater) and a casual acquaintance of the author, said he found plenty of fodder for a book. He recently sold his manuscript, “Jonathan Franzen: The Comedy of Rage,” to Bloomsbury for publication next fall. An announcement of the deal on the industry website Publishers Marketplace promises that the book will explore “Franzen’s metamorphoses as a person and as a writer — from his ultrasensitive childhood through his Swarthmore years, his troubled marriage and his tumultuous self-reappraisal during the 1990s, up to his arrival on the mainstream cultural scene as a literary icon.” Mr. Weinstein says his goal isn’t to dig up dirt on the novelist, but rather to examine how turmoil in his life has shaped his work. “It’s not an exposé of Jonathan Franzen,” he said. It’s not even a proper biography, he said, adding: “It doesn’t pretend to be a full-scale biography. It’s too early for that. He’s in full career mode. Someone later, a generation from now, will do that biography. It’s a report on who he is.” Mr. Weinstein, who joined Swarthmore’s faculty in 1971, said that he never taught Mr. Franzen as a student, but that they got to know each other when Mr. Franzen returned to campus to teach a creative writing seminar. Mr. Weinstein said he became interested in Mr. Franzen’s evolution as a writer and read all his books and biographical essays. About two years ago, he emailed Mr. Franzen and asked for his blessing to write a book. “I said, ‘This is what I’m thinking of. What do you think? I won’t do it if you don’t want me to do it,'  ” Mr. Weinstein said. “He liked the idea.” As for the punchy subtitle, “The Comedy of Rage,” Mr. Weinstein said, “I’m going to argue that he’s working toward turning rage into comedy.” Mr. Franzen declined to comment on the biography. Apart from a two-hour interview that took place in Mr. Franzen’s apartment, Mr. Weinstein said he would be relying on Mr. Franzen’s published autobiographical essays for details about his personal life. He also plans to include an analysis of Mr. Franzen’s next novel, a work in progress.
