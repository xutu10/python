Donald A. Pels, a media executive whose early investment in cellphone networks paid off for his company and for himself, died on Oct. 16 at his home in Manhattan, where he had become a major philanthropist in his later years, kick-starting the development of the elevated High Line park. He was 86. The cause was congestive heart failure, his daughter Valerie Pels said. Mr. Pels was a media executive on the rise as the chief financial officer of Capital Cities Communications Corporation when, in 1969, the board of Lin Broadcasting, a troubled company, asked him to look at it and make recommendations. The board liked his ideas so much that Mr. Pels was invited to take over the company. He was its chairman and president for the next 20 years. When Mr. Pels took control, Lin was a small, money-losing conglomerate. He shed all of the company’s businesses outside of broadcasting except for one: a radio paging company, Page Boy, in New York. It was a tiny business, but it was the wireless technology of its day. Over the years Mr. Pels moved Lin’s broadcasting interests mainly away from radio toward television. But starting in the early 1980s, he plunged into the speculative field of cellular communications, applying to the Federal Communications Commission for licenses. At the time, mobile phones were mainly in cars and required suitcase-size radio equipment. Smaller mobile phones began to appear later in the 1980s, but they were expensive and still unwieldy — the size and weight of large bricks. But by the end of the decade, as cellphones were becoming smaller and more popular, Lin held significant stakes in the licenses covering New York, Los Angeles, Houston and a few other markets, thanks to Mr. Pels’s faith in the future of wireless communication. “Donald Pels had gone out and invested when there were not a lot of believers,” Tom Alberg, a Seattle venture capitalist and a former executive vice president of McCaw Cellular Communications, said in an interview Wednesday. “No one was walking around on street corners making calls back then.” Mr. Pels’s investments meant that anyone aspiring to build a national cellular service needed Lin’s assets. In a bidding contest between BellSouth and the upstart McCaw Cellular in 1989, McCaw won, and bought a controlling interest in Lin in a deal valued at more than $3 billion. (In 1993, AT&T; agreed to buy McCaw Cellular for more than $12 billion.) At the time, no one expected the coming shift from analog phones to digital mobile devices. “It was a telephone world then,” Jeff Kagan, an independent technology analyst, said Wednesday. “But there were a few people who truly understood that we were going wireless, and Pels was one of them.” Mr. Pels’s personal profit on the McCaw deal was estimated at nearly $175 million because of his 3 percent ownership stake in the company and stock options. Donald Arthur Pels was born on Jan. 23, 1928, in New Rochelle, N.Y., to Herbert and Alice Pels. He graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and earned a law degree at New York University. Besides his wife, Wendy Keys, and his daughter Valerie, Mr. Pels is survived by another daughter, Juliette Meeus; a son, Laurence; a sister, Betty Schwartz; and four grandchildren. Mr. Pels began shifting his focus from business to an eclectic kind of philanthropy when he was in his early 60s. He often gave money to nonprofit ventures before they became well known. A longtime board member of the New York Philharmonic, Mr. Pels endowed a chair for the principal bassoon. He was also a steady contributor to Rockefeller University, mainly supporting pure science fields like biochemistry and structural biology. When money was need to repair and electrify the lighthouse on Roosevelt Island in the East River, Mr. Pels wrote a check. He was also a major supporter of Human Rights Watch; his wife, a filmmaker, is a vice chairwoman of the organization. His gift of $1 million to a campaign to turn the High Line, an old elevated rail spur on the West Side of Manhattan, into a public park helped provide momentum for the project. In 1999, Robert Hammond and Joshua David founded Friends of the High Line, a nonprofit organization. Mr. Pels and his wife attended its first fund-raiser, a cocktail party, in 2000. At the time, Mr. David recalled, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani’s position was that the High Line should be torn down. Mr. Pels disagreed. “We were a fledgling organization, and it was an underdog project when he supported us,” Mr. David said. The charity began its first major capital campaign in 2005, and after a brief visit from Mr. Hammond and Juliet Page, the organization’s development director, Mr. Pels sent a handwritten check for $1 million. “It was an amazing moment, by far the biggest donation we had received at the time,” Mr. David said. “It paved the way for others to make contributions at that level. It changed the course of our organization.” The first section of the park opened in 2009, and the third and final section opened in September. The park now draws five million visitors annually.
