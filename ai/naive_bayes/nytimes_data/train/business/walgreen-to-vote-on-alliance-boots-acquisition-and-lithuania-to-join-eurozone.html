WALGREEN Investors in the Walgreen drugstore chain will vote on Monday on whether to approve the acquisition of the remaining 55 percent of Alliance Boots, a European rival, for $4.9 billion, plus shares. The vote, which is expected to green-light the takeover, comes after Walgreen executives decided not to move the company’s headquarters overseas to cut the amount of tax paid to the United States government. MARK SCOTT LITHUANIA TO BECOME 19TH EUROZONE MEMBER  Lithuania officially becomes the 19th member of the eurozone on Thursday, and probably the last new member for several years. The Lithuanian litas has been pegged to the euro for more than a decade. For Lithuania, membership in the currency bloc tightens the country’s ties with the rest of Europe at a time when many people in the Baltic countries feel threatened by Russia. Membership on the governing council of the European Central Bank will swell to 25 with the addition of Vitas Vasiliauskas, chairman of the Lithuanian central bank. JACK EWING
