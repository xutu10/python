Iger will remain chief executive and chairman of the Walt Disney Company until June 2018, an extension of two years beyond his previously extended retirement date, which reflects a remarkable track record. The second extension, announced by Disney on Thursday, will be his last: Mr. Iger plans to name a chief operating officer early next year, an appointment that will end a succession race between two internal candidates.
