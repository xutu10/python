White Castle, a fast-food chain known for its tiny hamburgers, said it would offer a vegetarian version of its famous slider for 99 cents for a limited time. The meatless burgers have 150 to 270 calories — more than the 140 to 220 calories for the regular beef sliders. Customers may choose from three sauces: honey mustard, ranch and sweet Thai. James Richardson, a White Castle vice president, said that the 93-year-old company was committed to “keeping up with changing tastes.” The new sliders were tested over the summer in New York and New Jersey.
