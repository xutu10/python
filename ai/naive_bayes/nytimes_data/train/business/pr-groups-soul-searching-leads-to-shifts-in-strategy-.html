P.R. Group’s Soul-Searching Leads to Shifts in Strategy 
The Council of Public Relations Firms plans to adopt an informal name, the P.R. Council, and promote the benefits of public relations to senior executives of client companies.

SPIN specialists are hoping to do some spinning on their own behalf as a trade association for public relations agencies seeks to rebrand and refocus its efforts. The goal is to help members that are trying to remain relevant in an age of social media, word-of-mouth marketing and the pursuit of the almighty “buzz.” Leaders of the association, the  The association, founded in 1998, has more than 100 members. Some are owned by agency holding groups, and some are independent. The membership roster includes APCO Worldwide, Burson-Marsteller, Cohn & Wolfe, DeVries Global, Edelman, FleishmanHillard, Golin, Hill & Knowlton Strategies, Ketchum, LaunchSquad, Lippe Taylor, MSLGroup, Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide, Porter Novelli, Taylor and Waggener Edstrom Communications. The industry is facing a potential turning point. On one hand, shifts like the rising popularity of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social-media platforms — along with the increasing demand among marketers for content created on behalf of brands — have given public relations practitioners renewed opportunities to present what they do to marketers as an effective alternative to traditional advertising. On the other hand, the strong preference among users of social media for communications that are infused with qualities like authenticity and transparency — in other words, that are honest and spin-free — can create difficulties for an industry that wants to influence the directions of conversations and, ultimately, consumer behavior. Public relations  “We should be evolving all the time,” said Christopher Graves, the global chairman of Ogilvy Public Relations, who is also the chairman-elect of the P.R. Council. “And we should be doing it faster and faster, frankly.” There is “a gap between an old world of public relations and a new one” that must be addressed, he added, because “jobs that were more about media relations are now taking on a role of content creation and content marketing, which is more difficult to do.” “If you look at the findings from C.M.O. surveys, they reveal that C.M.O.s are drowning in complexity as marketing takes on everything from big data to social, mobile and location-based marketing, content marketing and more,” Mr. Graves said. “Meanwhile, reputations still take a long time to build but are destroyed faster than ever.” P.R. has “moved on from merely being a matchmaker between clients and media, or simply a publicist amplifying a story line, to taking the central role in a new world of ‘earned influence,’ “ he added, using a term that refers to positive perceptions obtained through efforts in realms like social media. The initiative was developed through efforts by the staff members of the association; a consultancy, the Infinia Group; and a working group of council members. “The old definitions of public relations, digital, advertising kind of don’t work anymore,” said Jim Joseph, the president for North America of Cohn & Wolfe, who was a committee leader. “The industry’s changing, and we have to help everybody change.” “We contemplated for a long time taking ‘P.R.’ out of the name” of the association, Mr. Joseph said, “but we never got to that” because “public relations has always been about engagement, influence, getting people to relate to something.” “We decided to stick to who we are but acknowledge it’s evolved and expanded,” he added. “We want to make sure young talent thinks about public relations.” The discussions with members this week are to be followed up with steps that include “an overhaul for the website, rolling out programming like new webinars and adjusting the content of conferences,” Mr. Joseph said. “A lot of this hits in the first quarter.” The association is not alone in rethinking what public relations means in the 21st century. Several giant public relations agencies have changed their approaches to the business, among them Edelman,  “There’s a battlefield for the hearts and minds of C.M.O.s, chief communications officers and other executives,” said Kathy Cripps, president of the P.R. Council. “We’re looking at this as an opportunity to extend our reach, refocus the conversation and enlighten the ones who aren’t convinced — for the public relations industry, not just the council.”
