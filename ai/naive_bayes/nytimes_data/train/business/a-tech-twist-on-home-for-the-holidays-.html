A Tech Twist on Home for the Holidays
The growth of marketing efforts for connected-home items is fueled by consumers’ appetite for new technology.

BACK in the day, a “connected Christmas” was when Mom and Dad managed to assemble Junior’s train set before he woke up to open his presents. Fast-forward to 2014, when Madison Avenue is wooing shoppers to make this a connected Christmas by adding products for the connected home — a.k.a. the smart home — to their holiday shopping lists. The growth in marketing efforts for connected-home items like thermostats, security cameras, smart lights and smoke alarms is being fueled by two factors. One is the hearty appetite among consumers for technology. The other factor is a steady increase in the arrival of  The category is “definitely building,” Kathee Tesija, chief merchandising and supply chain officer at Target, said in an interview this week as she and other senior executives discussed their Christmas 2014 marketing plans. “And it’s good all year long, not necessarily just for the holidays.” Those hoping shoppers will sing (with apologies to  Quirky has its own products, too, as do specialists in connected-home merchandise like  Google’s acquisition of Nest “has rapidly accelerated this market, by a year and a half,” said Kieran Hannon, chief marketing officer of Belkin in Los Angeles, and products that once interested primarily “tech types” now have a broader appeal. “ ‘Tech types’ is pretty much nearly everybody these days,” he added, particularly people “who love to solve things and share those ‘solves’ with their friends and family.” The campaign for WeMo, with a budget estimated at $10 million to $15 million, will seek to establish WeMo “as a stand-alone brand,” Mr. Hannon said; it has previously been marketed as Belkin WeMo. Mr. Hannon has hired the Los Angeles office of  The ads will promote WeMo as a way for “you to stay connected in the moment you’re in,” Mr. Hannon said, adding as an example: “If you’re having lunch you shouldn’t have to worry about dashing home to feed your pet. “For the holiday season, there’s one phenomenal use: Turning off the Christmas tree lights if you left them on.” A television commercial for WeMo depicts how a husband who is out of town uses WeMo devices to  “Technology can be cold and hard,” said Sue Anderson, executive creative director of Crispin Porter & Bogusky Los Angeles. “We want to give people actual things they could do to get them to talk about WeMo, ask, ‘Is there a way to WeMo that?,’ as part of their everyday lives.” The Nest campaign, which carries the theme “Thoughtful things,” is being created internally.  Although “there’s a lot of talk about the smart home and the Internet of things,” said Doug Sweeny, vice president for marketing of Nest in Palo Alto, Calif., “the campaign is very focused on the consumer benefit.” “We’re not talking in lofty terms,” Mr. Sweeny said, but rather “telling our story through the products themselves” and “the technology falls in the background.” Newspaper ads for the Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide alarm are almost all white space, save for a small logo and brief text. “Nest Protect can see the carbon monoxide you can’t,” the ad declares. Magazine ads for the Nest Learning Thermostat carry headlines like “Saving energy is a beautiful thing” and “Control it from across the room. Or across the globe.” Ads for the Dropcam security camera carry headlines like “Keep your home under lock and video” and “It streams peace of mind.” Before, Nest was known to consumers in the “early-adopter market” and the “tech-affinity market,” Mr. Sweeny said. “For Christmas, we want to introduce Nest to people who don’t know the brand.” According to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP, Nest ad spending in the first half of 2014 totaled $8.3 million, compared with $1.8 million in the same period a year ago. Belkin spent $339,000 in the first half to advertise WeMo, Kantar Media reported, compared with $428,000 in the same period a year ago.
