A Sudden Schism Between Shinzo Abe and the Bank of Japan Governor
Japan’s prime minister has postponed a planned tax increase championed by Haruhiko Kuroda, the bank’s governor, in a sharp break from their partnership.

TOKYO — The Japanese prime minister and central bank governor have cooperated so closely over the last two years that their relationship is routinely likened to a three-legged race. Bound at the ankles and moving in sync, they have hustled toward their declared goal of ending economic stagnation. The governor of the  Yet the partners suddenly look out of step. Mr. Abe announced on Tuesday that he would  “Prime Minister Abe has betrayed Kuroda and the Bank of Japan and chosen victory over scruples,” Soichiro Tahara, a prominent political commentator and journalist, wrote on Wednesday in a piece posted on the website of the Asahi Weekly magazine. In addition to delaying the second and final phase of the tax increase by a year and a half, to April 2017, Mr. Abe called a snap election for next month. Analysts believe his Liberal Democratic Party will win. Mr. Kuroda had lobbied hard for Mr. Abe to stick to a long-agreed timetable to increase the national sales tax, which was meant to double to 10 percent, with the first step coming last April and the second next October. Many saw an implicit deal: Mr. Kuroda would print more money, supporting the economy, and Mr. Abe would raise taxes and tackle the debt. “Fiscal discipline is the responsibility of the government and Parliament, not the central bank,” Mr. Kuroda said at a news conference on Wednesday, seeking to dispel talk of a rift. Asked if he thought delaying the tax increase would have the intended effect of encouraging growth and inflation, he added, “There’s no point going into my personal views.” Mr. Kuroda was speaking after the central bank’s policy committee voted to leave its monetary settings unchanged. The decision was universally expected, after  Masamichi Adachi, a former central bank official who is now an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said it was inevitable that Mr. Abe’s wishes would prevail in any disagreement with Mr. Kuroda over policy. “Some people regarded it as a coalition, and in that sense he’s lost standing,” he said of Mr. Kuroda. “But he totally understands he’s under Abe, not an equal. At the end of the day, the B.O.J. has no independence from the Abe administration.” Mr. Kuroda was appointed the Bank of Japan’s governor by Mr. Abe last year. Before that, he built his career at the Ministry of Finance, which has pushed for years to have the sales tax raised. With government revenue constrained by weak growth and deflation, Japan’s debt has grown to the equivalent of two and a half years’ economic output, by far the highest level in the developed world. Within the ministry, Mr. Kuroda was known as an advocate of aggressive stimulus measures, something that set him apart from more cautious colleagues. Yet compared with others in Mr. Abe’s inner circle, which includes proponents of all-out government spending financed by the central bank, he has been a relative budget hawk. “Maybe it’s because he still carries some Finance Ministry DNA, but he’s aware that if the government loses all financial constraint, there’s a risk of a bond-market plunge,” said a veteran ministry official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity to avoid antagonizing his former colleague. Mr. Kuroda said on Wednesday that he believed the Japanese economy was still fundamentally on a path to growth, despite government data released on Monday that showed that the country had  Gross domestic product contracted at an annualized rate of 1.6 percent, the data showed. That followed a 7.3 percent plunge in the previous quarter, after the first stage of the sales tax increase. The blow to consumer spending from the increase led to the recession and persuaded Mr. Abe to delay the second phase. Mr. Kuroda now appears to be focused on holding Mr. Abe to a pledge to stick to the new 2017 timetable no matter what obstacles the economy throws up. The plan is to balance the budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2020. Many economists say that is unrealistic, but Mr. Kuroda said on Wednesday that it was crucial to try. “The government has laid out a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan and has set a clear target,” he said. “I hope the government follows this plan diligently and creates a sustainable fiscal structure.”
