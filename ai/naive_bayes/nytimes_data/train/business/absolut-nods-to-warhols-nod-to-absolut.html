Absolut Nods to Warhol’s Nod to Absolut
Absolut is creating a campaign called “Make the holidays pop” to encourage sales of its vodka, especially a limited-edition bottle similar to one by Andy Warhol.

ABSOLUT is seeking to counter intensifying competition from other vodka brands as well as a revival of interest in “brown” spirits like bourbon by bringing out bottles based on a collaboration in the 1980s with the artist  Four million Absolut bottles are to be introduced around the world in a limited-edition look that recreates a bottle created by Warhol for a print ad, titled “Absolut Warhol,” from 1985 (or 1986; the dates differ in the Absolut archives). The bottles, priced the same as regular bottles of Absolut, are being produced through a partnership between Pernod Ricard, which owns Absolut, and the  The bottles will be promoted in a campaign beginning on Oct. 1, created by the  The “Absolut Warhol” ad was significant because it began a relationship between  The arts angle for Absolut marketing was the brainchild of Michel Roux, who led  But as the vodka market became crowded with dozens of new names, Absolut has struggled to recapture the sales growth it enjoyed a decade or two ago. That challenge has been compounded by an unexpected shift in purchasing patterns among drinkers 21 to 34: People those ages during the last 30 years favored “white” liquors like vodka over spirits like bourbon and whiskey, but the so-called millennials are embracing brown spirits. “It’s been quite challenging” with sales “quite flat the last few years,” said Joao Rozario, vice president for vodkas at Pernod Ricard U.S. “We have to make sure that Absolut is attracting consumers, younger consumers, again.” The promotion is not an exercise in nostalgia aimed at “bringing the brand back to what it was,” he added, because Warhol is “still an artist consumers today value a lot.” And the effort will be infused with modern elements, Mr. Rozario said, like an “Andy Warhol online art exchange” on a section of the brand’s website; consumers will be able to submit digital art and in return receive art from other consumers. There will also be events with artists, a public relations campaign by  “Warhol is an icon and Absolut has a fantastic heritage of collaborating with him,” said Dan Brooks, creative director at the Sid Lee New York office, adding: “This is not about being back in the past, rummaging in the past. It’s about looking forward, reinventing.” “The art and night life culture in New York surrounding Warhol was incredibly creative,” Mr. Brooks said, “and it’s something we’re taking inspiration from” in a new version of the “Transform today” campaign called  “The idea is: If Warhol was alive today, what amazing influence would he have on night life culture?” he added. The “incredibly fragmented” spirits market is making for “a tough time” for Absolut, Mr. Brooks said. “But we have a unique point of view and people know who Absolut is; it’s about what we need to do now to build our relevance among millennials.” “ ‘Make the holidays pop’ is a strong campaign that will help lift sales for the crucial holiday period,” he added. Mr. Rozario said plans called for “higher spending for the holidays for the U.S.” compared with previous years. According to the Kantar Media division of WPP, Absolut’s fourth-quarter ad spending totaled $5.9 million in 2013, $2.1 million in 2012, $7.5 million in 2011 and $4 million in 2010. Absolut is among several brands trying new ways to cut through the vodka clutter and compete against brown spirits. Others include  “Brands with a story, with a heritage, are going to resonate,” said John Esposito, president of the Stolichnaya Group USA. “Like anything else, the strong will survive.” Invoking heritage has become a popular marketing trend. In addition to Absolut, examples include Boodles gin, Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal, Jockey underwear, Jolly Time popcorn, Snuggle fabric softener and Tater Tots frozen potatoes.

For instance,  Among the artists with whom Perrier has previously collaborated is, yes, Warhol.
