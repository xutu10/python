The Transportation Department said on Thursday that flights on the nation’s largest airlines arrived on time 77.7 percent of the time in August. That is down from 78.8 percent in the same month last year, but it is better than July. The 14 airlines covered in the government report canceled 1.2 percent of their United States flights in August, compared with 1 percent a year earlier. The airlines blamed bad weather for an increase in delays and cancellations this year. The first half of 2014 was the worst for delays since 2008. Hawaiian Airlines, with good weather on much of its route network, held its usual place atop the rankings with 94 percent of its flights on time. Delta Air Lines, at 84.8 percent, was best among the largest carriers. American Airlines (73.2 percent) and one of its regional subsidiaries, Envoy Air (70.1 percent), had the worst on-time ratings. A spokeswoman for American, Andrea Huguely, said there were “several extremely challenging weather days that affected” several major airports. Only one domestic flight was delayed on the tarmac for more than three hours, violating federal rules. Nearly 300 flights ran more than two hours late.
