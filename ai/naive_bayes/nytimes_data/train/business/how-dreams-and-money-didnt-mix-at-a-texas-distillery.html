How Dreams and Money Didn’t Mix at a Texas Distillery
The founder of Balcones, an award-winning artisanal distillery in Waco, Tex., sought out capital to expand. But his passion collided with investors’ bottom line.
===
It was February 2013, and Chip Tate, the 39-year-old founder and president of Balcones, one of the country’s most successful artisanal distilleries, was desperate for money. From almost the day Mr. Tate opened the distillery — in Waco, Tex., in 2008 — Balcones grew like a weed, with sales of its corn and malt whiskey doubling each year. But making whiskey is a capital-intensive business, and expanding to meet skyrocketing demand takes significant money — money that Mr. Tate and his two investors did not have. Mr. Tate found what seemed like a perfect solution: Gregory S. Allen, a businessman from Virginia with money to burn. Over a series of phone calls and meetings that spring, the two came up with a plan for Mr. Allen to take a majority share in Balcones in exchange for $8.5 million for a larger distillery, debt repayment and working capital. In a statement announcing the deal, Mr. Tate said: “We’ve held out for partners that share our commitment to quality over quick return and who are interested in growing a business that we can pass on to our children. Many investors see that approach as old-fashioned, but we’ve taken time to find a group we’re proud to call partners.” Then things got weird. Depending on which side you ask, either Mr. Allen and the other members of the company’s board tried to steal the company away from Mr. Tate, or Mr. Tate became increasingly suspicious, erratic and violent. In either case, by September 2014, the board had suspended Mr. Tate and filed a restraining order against him after the employee of a business associate said that Mr. Tate threatened to shoot Mr. Allen and burn down the distillery (an accusation Mr. Tate denies). The board sued Mr. Tate, and he countersued. In early December, Mr. Tate agreed to let the rest of the board buy him out; he was then fired and, through a noncompete agreement, forbidden to make whiskey until March 2016. “This has been the strangest situation I have ever experienced,” Mr. Allen said in an interview. “Just surreal. Beyond words.” The drama at Balcones has resonated far beyond Waco, putting whiskey afficionados, distillers and, above all, potential investors on edge. The American whiskey industry is booming, and with the proven market power of “craft” products, small distillers are becoming takeover targets for big business. But the mess in Waco raises a question of how easily distiller-artists like Mr. Tate can accommodate investors who expect them to manage not just a whiskey still but a balance sheet, too. A Passionate Nonconformist Chip Tate didn’t always plan to make whiskey; for a while, he wanted to be a minister. After receiving a philosophy degree from the College of William & Mary, Mr. Tate, who is from Lynchburg, Va., studied theology at Union Presbyterian Seminary in Richmond. In 2002, he followed his wife to Baylor University in Waco, where she became an assistant professor and he took a job as an assistant dean. But Mr. Tate was unhappy tilling the bureaucratic fields and left to try his hand at information technology consulting. On the side, while caring for a growing family (he has five children), he began to dream of turning his love for home brewing into a business; when it became obvious that Texas was flush with new breweries but had almost nothing in the way of distilleries, he decided to make whiskey instead. In 2008, with an initial investment from Stephen Germer, a local businessman, Mr. Tate opened Balcones — named for a geological fault zone that runs about 450 miles from South Texas to near Waco — in a dusty former welding shop just west of the Baylor campus. Mr. Tate took an idiosyncratic approach to making whiskey, even for a start-up distillery. Instead of buying stills from Kentucky or Scotland, which could easily have cost over $100,000 each, he designed and built his own. He used local blue corn instead of buying in bulk from a commodity grain supplier. He even made his own barrels. A compact man with a receding hairline and a thick, meticulously brushed beard, Mr. Tate seemed to revel in a swaggering nonconformity. More than one person mentioned that he kept a loaded pistol in the distillery. (“It’s Texas,” Mr. Tate told me.) “He was very bold,” said Lew Bryson, the author of “ The effort and passion paid off: Mr. Tate’s whiskey was a hit almost from the moment it landed on shelves in 10 states in 2010. His first release, a young whiskey called Baby Blue, won a double gold, the highest honor in its category, at the prestigious  If Mr. Tate was the right man for the job, he also arrived at the right time. After declining for nearly 30 years, American whiskey sales were up 34 percent from 2008 to 2013,  “Chip put a marker in the ground showing how a small-scale distillery could actually work,” said Dave Broom, the author of “ But, several of Mr. Tate’s former employees say, his passion could be overwhelming, and he could be erratic and verbally abusive and prone to lashing out. “I have seen him take an 18-inch monkey wrench and beat it against a large metal trash Dumpster in fits of rage,” said Jared Himstedt in an affidavit filed this month. Mr. Himstedt began working at Balcones in 2008 and replaced Mr. Tate as master distiller after he left. Mr. Tate denies that he was ever abusive toward his employees. “That’s ridiculous,” he said, though, he conceded, “There might have been moments where I lost my cool.” By late 2012, Mr. Tate realized that he needed financial help to expand, even after bringing in a second investor, Michael Rockafellow, the owner of a distribution company in Lubbock. But building a new still, in a new space, would take serious capital — at least $4.1 million, Mr. Tate estimated, much more than he or his two investors could afford. The New Investor Enter Greg Allen. Born in Enid, Okla., he went east for a Harvard law degree and then west to Silicon Valley, where he specialized in venture capital financing. In 1991, he returned home to help run the Advance Food Company, his family’s food-processing business. Under Mr. Allen, now 52, that company had explosive growth, with sales rising to $520 million in 2010 from $26 million in 1991. Mr. Allen retired from the company that year and moved with his wife and four children to Charlottesville, Va., where he spends his time running his family’s investments and coaching a local high school baseball team. In early 2013, another Charlottesville businessman, Noell Michaels, called him about an opportunity to invest in a rapidly growing craft distillery called Balcones. Mr. Allen had no experience with the distilling industry, but, he said, “I got excited about the romantic concept of helping these people build their dream.” Mr. Michaels arranged a call between Mr. Allen and Mr. Tate, and a few weeks later Mr. Allen, who already had a business trip to Texas on his schedule, stopped in Waco to see Balcones up close. While Mr. Allen sampled some of Balcones’s latest releases, Mr. Tate sold him on his grand plans for making it into a world-renowned whiskey brand. “With Chip, it’s easy to get excited about that vision,” Mr. Allen said. After a few weeks of negotiations, Mr. Allen agreed to buy Mr. Germer’s and Mr. Rockafellow’s shares, and then, with Mr. Rockafellow, invest $8.5 million in Balcones. In return, Mr. Allen received a 58 percent stake and Mr. Rockafellow a 15 percent stake; Mr. Tate retained the remaining 27 percent. From Mr. Tate’s perspective, Mr. Allen’s role was to be strictly financial. “They would provide the money, and I would run the distillery,” he said. “And we would meet once a year and have a drink and that would be it.” But on paper, Mr. Allen and Mr. Tate weren’t equal partners. Along with a majority of the shares, Mr. Allen got to appoint three of the five board members. (Mr. Tate and Mr. Rockafellow were the other two.) Mr. Tate did win one important concession: His presence at board meetings was required for a quorum. At first, all sides agree, the arrangement went smoothly. Sales continued to rise, as did the medal count at spirits competitions. And plans continued apace for a new 65,000-square-foot distillery nearby, 30 times the size of the old one. “Those first months were great,” said Keith Bellinger, whom Mr. Tate hired in the fall of 2013 to run the company’s distribution. “And then it all deteriorated.” The first hint of tensions emerged at a board meeting in December 2013, when Mr. Tate reported that the price of the new distillery might be significantly higher — $8 million, or nearly double his original estimate. This was, Mr. Allen said, “an extraordinary miss,” and it led him and the other board members to question Mr. Tate’s management skills. Mr. Tate says he never guaranteed the $4.1 million price tag: “I told them what was perfectly known and unknown to the best of my knowledge.” And, he said, those unknowns were pretty large, because the stills were being built by a Scottish manufacturer according to Mr. Tate’s custom design. Nevertheless, in January, Mr. Tate agreed to bring in an engineering consultant to help with the plans. Around the same time, Mr. Tate began to chafe at what he perceived as attempts by  Mr. Allen’s three appointees to the board —  including Mr. Allen himself —  to dictate the company’s day-to-day operations. “I was realizing there were certain people who were going to be relentless in their insistence to be involved,” Mr. Tate said. He resented the idea that Mr. Allen’s people thought they knew how to run a distillery better than he did — and he had the sales numbers and awards to prove it. “It would be like me being in the operating room with fast-paced surgery going on, telling a doctor what to do,” Mr. Tate said. Mr. Allen, however, said he and Mr. Rockafellow had no choice but to become more involved with the company, especially when Mr. Tate began to refuse to attend board meetings that he deemed unnecessary. “Mike and I had a lot of money exposed,” Mr. Allen said. “Chip had a lot of authority and was not doing the fundamental things in terms of communications that were appropriate in an organization.” An Escalating Dispute By June, it had become clear that the new distillery was going to cost not $8 million, but more than $12 million. At a meeting that summer, Mr. Allen and Mr. Rockafellow made Mr. Tate an offer: They would pay for the increased costs, and even lend Mr. Tate the money to maintain his percentage share, if he would step down from his management role and let Mr. Allen’s team run the company. Mr. Tate said he feared that the investors’ motive all along had been to take over control of the company — “to back me into a corner and tell me to shut up” — and, eventually, to sell it for a premium to a multinational spirits company (several of which had already courted Mr. Tate). He rejected the offer and proposed either raising the money himself or buying out Mr. Allen. The board said no to both. Instead, Mr. Allen and the board pushed Mr. Tate harder. They gave him a negative performance review and demanded that he submit expense reports and a regularly updated travel schedule. They also began to schedule more board meetings, sometimes three a month, all of which Mr. Tate said he refused to attend. Around 10 a.m. on Aug. 5, Mr. Tate was meeting with a grain supplier in his office when Mr. Allen, whom he thought was back in Virginia, burst through the door with Mr. Bellinger. Mr. Allen had hired two off-duty sheriff’s deputies, who were sitting in their car outside. Mr. Allen gave Mr. Tate an ultimatum: either he would take a 60-day leave, or he would be suspended indefinitely. Mr. Allen said that, to his surprise, Mr. Tate agreed to take a leave. The next evening, though, Mr. Tate called one of Mr. Rockafellow’s assistants, Jody Wingrove. According to Mr. Wingrove, Mr. Tate was “very agitated,” threatened to “put two bullets” in Mr. Allen’s chest and said he would rather see the distillery burn to the ground than fall into Mr. Allen’s control. Mr. Tate admits he made a call, but he said Mr. Wingrove misread him. He hadn’t threatened Mr. Allen; rather, he said, he was so startled when Mr. Allen burst into his office that he could have shot him by accident. And he said that he didn’t threaten to burn down the distillery, but rather that without him in control, an accident was likely. The next morning, Mr. Wingrove reported the call to Mr. Allen, who immediately filed a police report, hired off-duty deputies as guards at the distillery and changed the locks and security system. When, a few days later, Mr. Tate pushed back against the leave agreement, the board suspended him and filed a temporary restraining order. On Aug. 22, they filed a lawsuit in the McLennan County District Court, seeking a permanent injunction against Mr. Tate. The story went public in early September in an article in  Mr. Tate countersued in late October, saying the board’s actions were invalid because they had been taken without him present, and thus without a quorum. The next month a judge agreed with him — and found that, without Mr. Tate present, Balcones couldn’t go forward with a new plan to finance the distillery expansion with a $15 million debt offering. After a few weeks, the two sides, now locked in a legal stalemate, agreed to mediation. Following a long negotiating session on Dec. 2, they settled on a deal in which the other owners would buy Mr. Tate’s share of the company. While the specific terms are confidential, Mr. Tate was able to whittle a proposed three-year noncompete clause to 15 months. The next day, the company announced that it had fired Mr. Tate. An All-Too-Common Pattern While few deals between entrepreneurs and investors collapse as dramatically, experts say the Balcones story fits an all-too-common pattern when it comes to start-ups, particularly in craft industries like artisanal distilling. “Research shows that because entrepreneurs often have a strong identification with their businesses, they have a hard time giving up control,” said  But Professor Wood also faults Mr. Allen’s apparent failure to grasp the intricacies of craft distilling, including the types of people who start distilleries. “I don’t think the investors fully understood the craft mentality,” he said. “When you compound that mentality with the textbook problems of entrepreneurs giving up control, it’s almost kind of a perfect storm.” Many people expect to see more such conflicts in the industry as investors continue to pour money into craft distilling. “I think we’re seeing a lot of overeager capital flowing into the category,” Mr. Bryson, the beer-spirits journalist, said. “It’s coming in without understanding what they’re investing in.” Balcones, meanwhile, is moving forward with its expansion plans, and Mr. Tate is looking for space for his next venture, Tate & Company Distillery. Though blocked from making whiskey for 15 months, he is free to go into other spirits. “It’s bittersweet, but I’m over it,” he said. “Maybe I’ll found a Texas brandy tradition.”
