Roger Ferguson of TIAA-CREF: Always Act as if You’re an Owner
A C.E.O. says he emphasizes personal accountability: “One of the phrases I use is that if you owned this company, what would you do? And if your colleagues were owners, what would you want them to do?”

This interview with Q. Were you in leadership roles when you were younger? A. I was captain of the high school cross-country team and editor of the yearbook, but nothing extraordinary. It’s not as if people looked at me and said, “That young man is going to be the C.E.O. of a Fortune 100 company one day.” Tell me about your parents. My mother was a public-school teacher, and my father was a cartographer for the Army. He was also very interested in banking and investments. We didn’t have much money, but he spent a lot of time talking to me about interest rates and the stock market and banks. Any expressions they would often repeat with you? No job is too small to do well. In my family, whatever you did, you did it right the first time. And if you didn’t do it right the first time, you learned and you went back and did it. Any leadership roles in college? I went to Harvard, and got involved in leadership roles on campus, including as a treasurer. I also was part of a college-wide committee on undergraduate life, which allowed me to work with some pretty important leaders. What else did you do outside of class? For my first two years at Harvard, I cleaned bathrooms. That was my work-study job — Monday through Friday, two hours a day, cleaning bathrooms for other students. I may have been the best bathroom cleaner that they ever had. A lot of students might be a little embarrassed by it. But I was, as I say to this day, proud to be a scrubbie. Somebody had to do it, and I did it well. Any challenges in your early management roles? When I was a second-year associate at a big law firm in New York, you start to have summer associates working for you on transactions. At first, you assume that everybody else, because they have very similar backgrounds and training, has exactly the same views about how work is going to get done. You have to get that balance right between leaving them alone and micromanaging.  You worked at McKinsey & Company for many years. What leadership lessons did you learn there? Almost everything at McKinsey gets done as a team, so you have to figure out how to be a constructive team member from Was it your goal to be a C.E.O. someday? It never really crossed my mind. I’m not one of those people who aggressively claw their way into the C-suite. In fact, there wasn’t a C.E.O. at most every place I’ve worked. You could be the managing partner at a law firm or the managing partner at McKinsey, but you were just one of many equals who had been voted into a leadership role. Is the C.E.O. job different from what you expected in any way? One of the things that C.E.O.s always say is that you don’t have as much control of a company as you might think. That is quite true. In our company, I can set the vision and the strategy, but I know full well that on any given day, individuals are making dozens of decisions over which I have no sort of direct control. It doesn’t happen often in my company, but it can look as though everything is happening according to your game plan and then you look under the hood and discover that it’s not. It goes back to the fact that people have their own realities. They have their own lives, their own pressures at work. The pressure of a client who wants something to happen immediately is quite different from the pressure of a C.E.O. standing in front of a town-hall meeting and saying we really should be excited about doing XYZ. One of those things is very abstract, and one of them is the reality of the moment. That’s why I think values are so important, because values help define what is an acceptable reaction and decision to the pressure of the moment. Is there a value on your list that is particularly important to you? One is about personal accountability. One of the phrases I use is that if you owned this company, what would you do? And if your colleagues were owners, what would you want them to do? What are your best interview questions? What do you do with your free time? I’m listening for somebody who is a little more balanced. I’m always asking about team experiences, and about resilience and fortitude. How did you recover from setbacks? What did you do? I like to hear stories, and concrete examples. What career and life advice do you give to graduating college students? You have to be prepared to take some risks and maybe fail a little bit. Don’t make the same mistake over and over again, but don’t be afraid of making any mistakes. Because your career is like a climbing wall, not a ladder, and you don’t know where it’s going to end up. You have to be a continuous learner as you go up the wall. There’s also that old expression, “Be nice to the folks you pass on the way up because you’re likely to see them on the way down.” I really do believe in that.
