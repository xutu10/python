The New York public radio station WNYC and the commercial television station WNBC have forged an unusual relationship in recent months, sharing investigative coverage on air and online. Now the two are teaming up, along with WNBC’s Spanish-language sister station, WNJU, and The Daily News, on a reintroduction of  Starting Monday, SchoolBook.org will  On Oct. 6, a new in-depth search tool will let site users compare public schools based on location, specializations and school performance, making New York Department of Education data more easily accessible. For the first time, SchoolBook’s search tool will be available in English, Spanish and Chinese. Revamped individual school pages will be easier to understand. SchoolBook began in the fall of 2011 as a partnership between WNYC and The New York Times. WNYC took ownership last year. The current partnerships came about as WNYC tried to figure out how to “reach more of the people who really rely on the public schools to get ahead,” said Jim Schachter, WNYC’s vice president for news. The partners will promote the site, including through social media and to their community partners, and produce separate articles about the school application process leading up to the Oct. 6 site reintroduction. WNBC’s participation stems from the reporting partnership it has forged with WNYC. Since late spring, the two have shared sources, data, audio and video on investigative coverage, originating at both stations, about pedestrian safety and problems with the 911 system, among others. Some of the stories run on air, some on their websites. No money changes hands. “They have a seven-person data-crunching unit and they can do some great things we just don’t have the resources for,” said Susan Sullivan, WNBC’s vice president for news, adding, “Between the two of us we can reach a broad audience.” The stresses on the economics of local news “are creating bedfellows who never would have been bedfellows before,” Mr. Schachter said. More collaboration is ahead. WNYC and WNBC will work together this fall on a weeklong look at the effect of climate change on the region, Mr. Schachter said, noting that, unlike WNYC, WNBC has both a meteorologist and a traffic helicopter.
