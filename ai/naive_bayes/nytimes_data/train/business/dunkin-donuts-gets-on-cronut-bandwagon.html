Dunkin’ Donuts plans to introduce a croissant-doughnut hybrid, the Croissant Donut, for a limited time starting Nov. 3. Over a year ago, Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York introduced its now-trademarked Cronut, which has spawned numerous imitations. John Costello, Dunkin’s president for global marketing and innovation, said the company regularly tracked consumer and bakery trends. “Are we copying a specific bakery in New York? The answer is no,” he told The Associated Press. The new pastry is one of several Dunkin’ is preparing after reporting disappointing quarterly sales last week. The Croissant Donut will cost $2.49, less than the $5 Cronut but more than twice most other Dunkin’ doughnuts. The Croissant Donut will be covered with the same glaze used for Dunkin’s Glazed Donut, but won’t have any cream filling like the Cronut. When asked to explain how the Croissant Donut and Cronut differed, Dunkin’s executive chef, Jeff Miller, said: “I’ve tried the product that you mention. As the executive chef of Dunkin’, I like ours better.” Last summer, Dunkin’ also introduced a croissant doughnut in South Korea it called the “New York Pie Donut.”
