NBC Lands Another First-Place Finish Among Networks
The network will end the television calendar year next week ahead of CBS, ABC and Fox among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49.

NBC put an exclamation point on its prime-time turnaround Tuesday by announcing (a week early) that it will end the television calendar year — September to September – in first place among the viewers it sells to advertisers. NBC had already won the official television season — which runs from September to May — in that category, but as of next week the network will have managed a first-place finish for the calendar year among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49. That is the group that many advertisers pay a premium to reach. Winning that group is an important financial achievement, though it hardly makes NBC the most popular network. Among total viewers, CBS remains the leader with exactly one million more viewers on average than NBC, 9.272 million to 8.272 million. (ABC was a distant third with 6.8 million, followed by Fox with 6.165 million.) But NBC was up by far the most, 25 percent over the prior year. It was also up 14 percent among the 18-to-49 group, to a 2.4 rating, while all its competitors were down or even. NBC benefited from broadcasting the Winter Olympics this past year. But even with the Olympics excluded, NBC would have won the 18-to-49 category with a 2.2 average rating, thanks to strong viewership for N.F.L. football and series like “The Blacklist” and “The Voice.” NBC decided to break down the past year one week early because next week the ratings noise will most likely be all about the new series being introduced by every network.
