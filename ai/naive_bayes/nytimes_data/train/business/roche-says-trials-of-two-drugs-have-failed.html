Roche Says Trials of Two Drugs Have Failed
Stocks in the Swiss drugmaker fell more than 5 percent after the announcement that trials of Kadcyla, for breast cancer, and gantenerumab, for Alzheimer’s disease, were ending.

Roche The company said it was ending a late-stage study of an experimental Alzheimer’s drug, gantenerumab, after it failed to prove effective. But a second failure, in a test of Roche’s new breast cancer drug, Kadcyla, was more damaging, hurting the company’s goal of broadening sales in a sector it has long dominated. Fabian Wenner, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, said consensus forecasts for annual Kadcyla sales of 2.5 billion Swiss francs ($2.56 billion) in 2020 would now “have to come down significantly.” Roche’s late-stage study in women with previously untreated advanced HER2-positive breast cancer showed three of its approved treatments — Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla — helped patients live longer without their disease worsening. But the two treatment arms containing Kadcyla did not prove superior, undermining expectations that the drug could become a new standard of care. Shares in Roche, which in recent years has had one of the most productive research pipelines in the industry, fell more than 5 percent. The setback in Alzheimer’s is disappointing for the wider field because many experts had hoped the final-stage Phase III study of patients with so-called prodromal disease, or pre-dementia, would produce a better outcome. Researchers are trying to develop effective therapies that can be used before patients’ brains are wrecked by the condition. Unlike heart disease and cancer, which have seen major strides in drug development, no new therapies have been approved to treat Alzheimer’s in a decade. Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia, already afflicts 44 million people worldwide, and this figure is set to triple by 2050, according to the advocacy group Alzheimer’s Disease International. Roche suffered a setback with another experimental Alzheimer’s drug earlier this year. “We remain committed to investigating new medicines for this devastating illness,” said Sandra J. Horning, the company’s chief medical officer. Gantenerumab continues to be studied in another Phase III trial involving patients with later-stage disease, and Roche has two other experimental Alzheimer’s drugs in Phase II tests, crenezumab and RG1577.
