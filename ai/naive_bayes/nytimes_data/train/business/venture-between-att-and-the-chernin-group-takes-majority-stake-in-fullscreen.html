The Fine Brothers But each of these Internet stars boasts millions of YouTube subscribers — crushing the 214,000 subscribers of classic youth entertainment brand MTV — and old media is paying attention. Otter Media, a joint venture between AT&T; and the Chernin Group, announced Monday that it had taken a majority stake in Fullscreen, a digital media company that connects popular online personalities and brands. The deal values Fullscreen at about $200 million to $300 million, according to people with knowledge of the deal. (Advertising conglomerate WPP also has invested in the company and will hold on to its stake.) “We don’t see anything more exciting in the media industry than what is happening with online video, over-the-top video and television increasingly migrating online,” said Jesse Jacobs, president of the Chernin Group. “What Fullscreen is doing in terms of redefining entertainment and media for young adults is powerful on a global scale.” About four years ago, former YouTube executive George Strompolos left his job to start Fullscreen based on the idea that the next generation of creators would percolate on social media and speak directly with fans. Fullscreen now has emerged as one of the leading entertainment companies in the YouTube-dominated digital video landscape. In addition to the Fine Brothers, Connor Franta and Our2ndLife, the company works with more than 50,000 content creators who count more than 450 million subscribers and 4 billion monthly views. “What felt like the future of media four years ago has quickly become the new reality,” Mr. Strompolos said in  Traditional entertainment groups now are racing to capture a piece of the digital video market, where young audiences are spending an increasing amount of time and the ad dollars are following. Digital video ad spending in the United States is on track to reach $5.96 billion this year, up 56 percent from 2013, but still minuscule compared with the $68.54 billion television ad market,  This year, the Walt Disney Company  “We’re in this odd world, where the brands we are creating are going to be the brands that the next generation affiliates with,” said Keith Richman, president of digital media group Defy Media, which works with the popular YouTube comedy duo Smosh. “It’s almost matter of fact.” One hurdle for these companies, industry executives say, is that their business is reliant on relationships with talent, which can be fluid. Fullscreen now mostly makes money through video ads, but plans are in the works to expand the business into integrated marketing, talent management, live events, merchandise and subscription sales and other revenue streams. Otter Media’s deal for Fullscreen comes as the telecom is preparing to build out its video offerings with its $48.5 billion proposed acquisition of DirecTV. The Chernin Group, meanwhile, has made a series of investments focused on streaming video and youth audiences.
