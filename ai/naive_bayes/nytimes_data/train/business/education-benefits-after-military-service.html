After Military Service, Taking Advantage of Educational Benefits
More than 1.4 million people have used benefits available under the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, but there are a host of other options as well.

A host of educational benefits are available to those who have served in the United States armed forces, but figuring out which program a service member is eligible for can sometimes be a challenge. “There is a ton of stuff out there, but it can be confusing,” said Betsy Mayotte, director of regulatory compliance with American Student Assistance, a nonprofit group that aims to help students avoid defaulting on education loans. Some states, for instance, offer their own military assistance programs, in addition to federal benefits. The group recently compiled an online  The most generous menu of education perks, however, is available under the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, which took effect in 2009 and offers financial help for college and training for both veterans and those on active duty and, in some cases, their family members. More than 1.4 million people have used the education benefits as of September 2013, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, which administers the benefits. Post-9/11 G.I. Bill benefits are available to those who served in the armed services after Sept. 10, 2001. The program, in general, pays up to 100 percent of tuition and fees for in-state public schools, plus a $1,000 stipend for books and supplies, and a monthly housing allowance. Benefits are pegged to length of service. To receive 100 percent tuition coverage, for instance, you must have accumulated at least 36 months of active duty. Payments are prorated for those with fewer months of service, but you must have at least 90 days of active duty to qualify. A chart showing the different benefit tiers is available at  If you attend a private college, the G.I. Bill puts a cap on annual payments for tuition and fees at about $20,000. However, veterans may be eligible for additional financial help under the Yellow Ribbon program, in which colleges participate voluntarily. A list of schools currently participating can be found on the  One especially attractive aspect of the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill is that it allows some military members to transfer the unused education benefit to a spouse or children. To be eligible, you generally must have served for at least six years and agree to serve at least four more years. (The transfer of benefits must be elected before being discharged from the military, said Randal Noller, a spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs.) Other educational assistance programs may help cover college costs, even for those who don’t qualify for Post-9/11 benefits. Paul Nelson, a junior at the University of Southern Maine, said he didn’t have enough active duty time to meet the Post-9/11 requirements. But he gets some help with college-related expenses from a program under the older Montgomery G.I. Bill, based on his service with the Maine Air National Guard. He gets more than $300 each month, which helps cover the cost of books as well as expenses for his car; he lives off campus and commutes to classes. “It helps with my car payment and  Active duty military personnel generally can qualify for payment of up to 100 percent of the cost of eligible courses taken on their own time, under military tuition assistance programs; each branch of the military sets its own cap for these programs, which are administered by the Defense Department. (Typically, service members use their tuition assistance benefits first, since G.I. Bill benefits are available after discharge, and can be transferred to other family members, said a Defense Department spokesman.) Other programs offer  Here are some questions about education benefits for military service members: ■  The Department of Veterans Affairs now has  ■  File  The VA processes it and issues a certificate of eligibility, which you provide to your school. ■  You generally have up to 15 years after your last period of active duty to use benefits under the Post-9/11 G.I.
