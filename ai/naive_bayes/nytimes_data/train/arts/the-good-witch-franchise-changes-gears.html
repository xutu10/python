The ‘Good Witch’ Franchise Changes Gears
Cassie Nightingale remains secure in her powers of sorcery in Hallmark Channel’s last made-for-television “Good Witch” movie.

Fans of Hallmark Channel’s made-for-television “Good Witch” movies — and there are about 3 million of you out there — are facing big changes.  The success of the films has a lot to do with the casting of the wholesomely sultry  If you’re accustomed to the high seriousness and complicated plots of today’s fashionable cable shows “The Good Witch’s Wonder” is so far on the other side of the narrative spectrum that there doesn’t seem to be anything happening at all. Cassie helps out with a silent auction; her stepson argues with his fiancée; her stepdaughter doesn’t have a date for the wedding. A mysterious woman appears in town and Cassie, sensing a kindred spirit, gives the woman a job at her new-age trinket store. Reinforcing this overall modesty, or mildness, the “Good Witch” films are coy about Cassie’s actual powers. She has a way of appearing and disappearing under people’s noses, but it happens just off camera. Maybe she moves really quickly. More openly enchanted are the objects she dispenses to those in need, like the camera obscura she gives her stepdaughter in “Wonder” that focuses only on soul mates. But generally her wizardry is domestic — when her stepson unexpectedly comes home, with guests, she’s already started a double batch of his favorite chicken vindaloo. Cassie’s magic is really that of being the ideal middle-American wife, mother and friend, anticipating crises and soothing feelings. She goes about this with unflagging certainty, secure in her powers and unafraid of high-fructose sentiment. “I wish I could just disappear,” a troubled soul tells her, and she replies, “But then I wouldn’t be able to see you.” Ms. Bell, through an alchemy of eyes, voice and attitude, is somehow able to make Cassie’s sanctimony register as both sincere and sexy, and she brings a little frisson to what’s otherwise competently assembled, utterly disposable family fare. But the continued prosperity of the good witch indicates that there’s still an audience that likes its magic on the lighter side.
