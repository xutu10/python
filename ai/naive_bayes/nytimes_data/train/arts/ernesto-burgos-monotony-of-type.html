Ernesto Burgos: ‘Monotony of Type’
Ernesto Burgos’s painted sculptures at Kate Werble are full of surprises.
===
Ernesto Burgos is in his early 30s and still finding his way, but his  In a way, Mr. Burgos is combining bad painting with bad sculpture to make something that is more than the sum of its parts. If you flattened out his looping pale resin forms, the loose brush work and smeared paint coursing across their surfaces might resemble second-generation Abstract Expressionism from the 1950s, except for occasional additions of spray paint. And if his sculptures were earth-toned, they could evoke a ’50s piece by the ceramic sculptor But the improvisational energy at work here goes beyond such references. The pieces are painted inside and out, and also sometimes collaged with scraps of images, which makes them full of surprises. In some instances, the painted additions leap from plane to plane, like the coiling black lines that corral “Not in Any Recent Moment.” More often, there are abrupt changes of pace, as in the contrasting passages on “Lazy Habits of Thinking,” a piece that from one angle resembles a squashed, heavily grafittied garbage can, and from another, a billowing sail of white and cream, anointed with a spare calligraphy. The title of the show, “Monotony of Type,” raises the question of whether these works are intended ironically. Mr. Burgos may be parodying the whole idea of style, especially an improvisatory one, skewering it as a source of sameness. That makes the show a bit less interesting while whetting curiosity about where he’s headed.
