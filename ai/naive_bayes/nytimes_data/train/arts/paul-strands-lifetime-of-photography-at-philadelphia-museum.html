Paul Strand’s Lifetime of Photography, at Philadelphia Museum
“Paul Strand: Master of Modern Photography,” at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, reappraises Strand as a modernist turned humanist as well as a cinephile.

PHILADELPHIA —  As a young man working in the orbit of Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand defined modernist photography. Later on, it defined him. Although Strand made films and books, and worked into the mid-1970s, his legacy has been shaped by his Cubist still lifes and rigorously geometric cityscapes of the 1910s, images like “Wall Street,” in which dark-coated workers, tagged by long shadows, look almost as abstract as the facade of the Morgan Trust building that looms over them. Now, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which mounted the last major Strand retrospective in 1971, has given us an elegant and convincing reappraisal. In “Paul Strand: Master of Modern Photography,” we see him as a modernist turned humanist, and a photographer who was just as much a cinephile. Drawing on the Philadelphia museum’s sizable Paul Strand Collection (most of it  Bringing modernism down to earth, Strand branched out from Manhattan’s parks and skyscrapers to Maine forests, Mexican churches and small villages in Italy and New England. The immense but well-paced show makes room for mentors and influences beyond Stieglitz, among them the fin de siècle Parisian photographer Eugène Atget, the Italian neo-realist screenwriter Cesare Zavattini and the American social documentarian Lewis Hine (one of Strand’s teachers at the Ethical Culture School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan). Organized by Peter Barberie, the Philadelphia museum’s curator of photographs, and the assistant curator Amanda N. Bock, the exhibition is making its only United States stop here. (It will be seen at the Fotomuseum Winterthur in Switzerland, the Fundación Mapfre in Madrid, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.) The curators’ emphasis on human and local interest is clear from the first few galleries, where Strand’s early still lifes — topsy-turvy arrangements of fruit and crockery, contemporaneous with Cubism and the Armory Show — hang opposite his more subtly experimental 1916 street portraits. Working with a camera that had been outfitted with a false lens (the real one was tucked into his coat sleeve), he was able to capture his subjects in moments of extreme un-self-consciousness: disheveled and drowsy (“Yawning Woman”) or distracted (“Man Looking Up). ” In another gallery, the curators hang Strand’s quasi-abstract close-ups of his beloved Akeley motion picture camera next to his sensuous portraits of his first wife, Rebecca Salsbury, which evoke Stieglitz’s shots of Georgia O’Keeffe. The pairing neatly expresses Strand’s emotional and intuitive relationship to an art form associated with all things mechanical; in his 1922 essay  In his early “Manhatta,” which was conceived as a “scenic” (in the movie-theater parlance of the day), could be seen as either an episodic film or a series of moving photographs. Working in Mexico for two years during the Depression, Strand moved deeper into filmic narrative (and, at the same time, into leftist circles). He made his first feature-length film, “Redes” (“The Wave”), about a fishermen’s strike in Veracruz. He also took portrait pictures on the sly, as he had in 1916, this time with a prism that allowed him to shoot off to the side while appearing to aim straight ahead. Although he worked in public, he did not see himself as a street photographer or a photojournalist; for one thing, he moved too slowly, favoring an 8-by-10 view camera and long exposures. As Mr. Barberie writes, Strand “operated like a studio photographer in the open air.” He also fussed over his prints, hand-varnishing them and making other surface alterations. He was just as deliberate about his films, holding up the production of his most ambitious motion picture,  The “Native Land” debacle prompted Strand to explore photo books as an alternate form of storytelling. The second half of the show is dedicated to those book projects, which occupied Strand for the remainder of his career. They are not nearly as well known as they should be, in part because they were expensive, limited-edition publications. (All are now out of print, but visitors can page through digital facsimiles.) “Time in New England” (1950) is a nature-to-culture study of the region laced with historical texts chosen by the photography curator and historian Nancy Newhall. Including numerous shots of meeting houses and town halls along with close-ups of foliage and dignified portraits of local characters, it wears its politics more subtly than “Native Land” but can nonetheless be read as a response to McCarthyism. The year of its release, Strand moved to France. From his base in Orgeval, he traveled widely and took on book projects in Italy, Egypt and Ghana. But the American small town, as both a model democracy and a literary device along the lines of Sherwood Anderson’s He found his dream in a modest setting — Luzzara, Italy, the hometown of his new acquaintance Zavattini (the neo-realist screenwriter) — producing a memorable book of portraits, “Un Paese (Portrait of an Italian Village)” (1955), that illuminated the town’s civic and family life and its regional culture. His subjects included a mayor and his mother, and a maker of the village’s Parmigiano cheese. Their slightly pained expressions reflect the recent traumas of life under Fascism, and perhaps also the intensity of posing for Strand. His final book, “Ghana: An African Portrait,” is just as cinematic but less character based. It’s also upbeat and, for the first time, forward looking. Strand traveled to the newly independent Ghana in 1963-64 at the invitation of its president, Kwame Nkrumah, and Strand’s pictures of dams, oil refineries and hospitals under construction show the rapid pace of postcolonial development. But his typically incisive and nuanced portraits keep the project from tilting into propaganda, as did its delayed release: The book came out in 1976, more than a decade later, and four years after the death of Nkrumah, who had been deposed in 1966. The catalog and Ms. Bock’s essay reveal that Strand wanted to do a book somewhere in the Soviet Union, and that he advocated a realism that “takes sides.” In the show, however, his idea of the modern photograph is decidedly nonpartisan. For him, it could be abstract or representational, still or moving, staged or spontaneous, urban or provincial, as long as it was human.
