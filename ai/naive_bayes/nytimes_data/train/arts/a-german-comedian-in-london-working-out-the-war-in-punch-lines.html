A German Comedian in London: Working Out the War in Punch Lines
Henning Wehn has made a living by mocking dearly held stereotypes in Britain.

LONDON —  Britons have strong national views on who is funny (they are) and who is not. “Where would we be without humor?” an old joke asks. Answer: “In Germany.” Henning Wehn, a German stand-up comedian who insists his job description is not an oxymoron, has heard that jibe more than once since arriving here 12 years ago. As with other jokes about his country, often involving a spot of fake goose-stepping or allusions to the 1939 invasion of Poland, he still laughs — mostly to avoid being told he has no sense of humor. “Where are we going to lunch?” his British friends are fond of asking, he said in a recent interview. “Is Henning coming? Then we can’t go to the Polish place next door because he is never going to leave.” A 40-year-old former marketing executive from small-town Germany who did not know what stand-up comedy was before coming to Britain, Mr. Wehn has made a living by mocking dearly held stereotypes in his host country — not least the one about Germans being boring. In one bit, he earnestly explained every last point in a thick Teutonic accent, putting his audience in stitches. (“Stop laughing. I haven’t even explained it yet.”) Mr. Wehn’s comedy works partly because stereotypes of efficient but humorless Germans still linger. (“Either I’m funny or I live up to a national stereotype — it’s win-win,” he said.) But his success also signals that somewhere in the quarter-century between the fall of the Berlin Wall and Germany’s 2014 World Cup victory, clichés have been emptied of the rawness of previous generations. “All this stuff about  Even as recent internal European Union politics have soured relations between their governments, Britain, with its Protestant heritage and German-descended royals, and Germany are experiencing a renaissance of cultural exchange perhaps not seen in a century, Mr. Garton Ash said. A Briton, Simon Rattle, conducts the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Another, Norman Foster, designed the Reichstag restoration. A high-profile exhibition at the British Museum about 600 years of German history has attracted more than 50,000 visitors in its first two months, far exceeding expectations. As for Mr. Wehn, his 180 stand-up shows across Britain this year were largely sold out. Has Britain revised the postwar image of Germany, its favorite enemy, as that nation’s dozen years of Nazi rule recede in the collective memory? Mr. Wehn, an avid soccer fan, thinks the best answer lies on the field: When Germany beat Brazil 7-1 in the semifinals of this year’s World Cup and then went on to win the tournament, “Brits actually cheered,” he said, the odd Brazil-is-not-Poland tweet notwithstanding. Not so long ago, that would have been unthinkable. Soccer was once defined by a British commentator as “a simple game: 22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes, and at the end the Germans always win.” It is also a good weather vane of relations between the two countries. In 1966, the only time England beat Germany in a World Cup (albeit with a disputed goal), England supporters vented with “Two world wars and one World Cup,” a chant Mr. Wehn later adapted as a title for a 2006 show: “Four World Cups and One World Pope.” In 1990, when Germany, on the verge of reunification, beat England in the final, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was asked how she felt about losing to Germany at Britain’s national sport. “I shouldn’t worry too much,” Ms. Thatcher replied. “We’ve beaten them twice this century at theirs.” A perceptible change came in 2006, when Germany hosted the World Cup and Mr. Wehn’s career really took off. “Suddenly, the German flag was reclaimed from the far-right and the British tabloids stopped treating football like it was a re-enactment of the war,” he said. “The war,” as World War II is invariably referred to here, has long been a central part of Britain’s national myth, a time when, backs to the wall, Britons kept calm and carried on. It was, in Winston Churchill’s words, Britain’s “finest hour.” But if Blitz-braving Britons are the heroes of this era, Germans are the inevitable villains. In his North London apartment, Mr. Wehn keeps a copy of his favorite British comedy series, “Fawlty Towers,” a 1975 show about an eponymous bed-and-breakfast owned by the hilariously hapless Basil Fawlty, played by John Cleese of Monty Python. In one memorable episode, “The Germans,” Fawlty makes a German guest cry because he just can’t stop mentioning “the war.” “Will you stop talking about the war?” the husband of the noisily sobbing German lady pleads. “Me? You started it,” Fawlty replies. “We did not start it,” the German says. “Yes, you did. You invaded Poland.” “Don’t mention the war” remains an iconic phrase. Mr. Wehn was recently invited to a televised comedy talk show with three other comedians. “The war, I mean, I have to chip in now,” Mr. Wehn told the audience with faux exasperation. “Everyone in Britain takes personal credit for Britain winning it, even people that weren’t born at the time.” What about those in their 70s today? “How did you help win the war when you were just 10 years old?” Mr. Wehn asked. “You were nothing but a drain on British resources. Effectively, every 70-year-old Brit fought on the side of Nazi Germany.” Once, at a show in Essex, the entire audience showed up in Hitler mustaches. Mr. Wehn still chuckles at the memory: “It wasn’t menacing. I just thought it was hilarious that they thought they were the first to come up with it.” He likes to tell a story about his first night in Britain, when he turned on the television and promptly stumbled across a black-and-white film about the war. “Look at that, a documentary about World War II. What are the chances?” he recalled thinking. “Now I know: They are 100 percent.” Wartime documentaries are still popular (at least nine in the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day). But now one can also tune in to a new crop of prime-time programs, debating Germany’s apprenticeship model or high savings rate or admiring its exporting panache. A school exam board announced this year that high school history curriculums should teach more Asian history and less “Hitler.” As history recedes, Mr. Wehn, too, is adjusting. From the monarchy to a very British obsession with charity and that struggling national soccer team, he takes aim at everything that is dear in contemporary Britain — with one exception. “Every country has its taboos,” he said. “We have the Holocaust. Britain has Lady Di. You can’t really joke about Lady Di.”
