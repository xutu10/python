Waitress Is One of Many New Writers With Big Book Deals
“Sweetbitter,” by the 30-year-old waitress Stephanie Danler, is but one in a crop of debut novels acquired by publishers in lucrative deals.

In his more than 30 years in publishing, Peter Gethers, a senior vice president and editor at large at Penguin Random House, has gotten used to strangers’ foisting manuscripts on him at inopportune moments. The unsolicited novels are rarely any good, and almost never worth publishing. So Mr. Gethers’s expectations were modest when a young waitress who works at  Mr. Gethers delivered his usual polite deflecting line: Have your agent send it to me. “The book came in, and within 10 pages, I was going, ‘Oh, my God, this woman is an extraordinary talent,’ ” Mr. Gethers said. “One doesn’t see a lot of first novels like this, or any novels like this.” The unlikely way the book came to him has the whiff of an urban legend, and will probably further stir the creative ambitions of artistically inclined servers around the city. “It never happens this way,” he said. But the restaurant connection proved oddly fitting. The novel, “Sweetbitter,” by Stephanie Danler, centers on a recent transplant to New York who gets a job at a fancy restaurant near Union Square. (It is unnamed, but Manhattan foodies will recognize it as the Union Square Cafe, where Ms. Danler worked for a year after moving to the city.) The young woman, Tess, gets tangled up in a sort of love triangle with co-workers, and falls under the spell of a more experienced server named Simone. Mr. Gethers mentioned the novel to a colleague who acquires books, Claudia Herr. She had already heard about the novel from Melissa Flashman, Ms. Danler’s literary agent. The manuscript came in just before the Frankfurt Book Fair — when the entire publishing industry goes into a book-buying frenzy — and editors were tearing through submissions. “All of us were reading 60 things at once,” Ms. Herr said. But “Sweetbitter” jumped out at her. Days later, in early October, Ms. Herr acquired the book for Alfred A. Knopf in a pre-emptive high-six-figure, two-book deal. Ms. Danler’s deal is the latest in a string of splashy book contracts for debut novelists, a sign that publishers are once again willing to make big bets on unknown writers, after years of waning book advances. Random House  High advances often lead to bigger marketing budgets and more publicity for a book, but they also carry the burden of heightened expectations and pressure to sell well. “Sweetbitter” is both a coming-of-age and coming-to-New York story, and a novel about the seductive pleasures of food and wine. The story unfolds inside the glamorous, cutthroat and sometimes seedy world of elite Manhattan restaurants. Ms. Danler, 30, who is from Seal Beach, Calif., and went to Kenyon College in Ohio, moved to New York in 2006. Since then, she has cycled through several restaurant jobs, including stints at two Spanish restaurants in Chelsea. She earned a master of fine arts degree in creative writing at the New School, where she studied with Helen Schulman and Jonathan Dee and worked on “Sweetbitter.” She finished writing the novel this summer. Knopf plans to release it in 2016. “The way she writes about food, you can actually taste it,” Mr. Gethers said. He said he’s now looking forward to reading the novel by the other Buvette waitress. “She hasn’t finished it yet,” he said. “I’ve been promised it by the end of November.”
