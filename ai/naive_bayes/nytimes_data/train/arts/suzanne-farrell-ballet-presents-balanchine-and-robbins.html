Suzanne Farrell Ballet Presents Balanchine and Robbins
Suzanne Farrell’s company displays her approach in a program of five works at the Kennedy Center in Washington.

WASHINGTON —  During her own long career onstage,  After she started her company in 2000, she quickly established a reputation for helping other star dancers attain something of her own luster; she’s said to have transformed such high-profile dancers as  For some seasons now, however, things have been considerably more complicated. City Ballet has developed a variety of stars who shine with real individuality, whereas the Farrell troupe, based at the Kennedy Center here (it also tours a small amount), has been operating without any eminent stars since at least 2007. This does not mean, however, that the Farrell company has lost its reason for being. Last weekend I watched its annual season at the Kennedy Center: a single program offering five works, four by Balanchine and one by Jerome Robbins. All five were well served; all five had virtues that are absent from City Ballet’s renditions. Although Ms. Farrell was the loftiest of stars, her touch today is often most remarkable at corps level. Some of these dancers have obvious flaws, yet it was remarkable how I noticed them only at the moments I also reacted to the unusual illumination being brought to some of the choreography. The corps for Balanchine’s “Allegro Brillante” (1956) is small: four women, four men. One woman demonstrated, at each performance, a sickle foot (breaking the leg’s straight line at the ankle), and another had unusually large calf muscles, but these traits registered precisely as the dancers were seizing individual arabesques with extraordinary force. One ensemble for these eight dancers was so ablaze with energy that the whole ballet changed beyond recognition, becoming a view of organized chaos in which any larger pattern was momentarily — gloriously — shattered by the inflamed sweep of individual dancers. The Balanchine experience during his lifetime was often far from neat or tidy; it was a view of galvanizing vitality that seemed not to respond to the aural accompaniment, but to embody it. Again and again the Farrell dancers revealed music, on many levels: they anticipated it, arrived with it, showed details of its meter and the sweep of its larger momentum. In the pair of short Balanchine ballets set to Stravinsky, “Monumentum pro Gesualdo” (1960) and “Movements for Piano and Orchestra” (1963), Ms. Farrell’s understanding of the choreography made extraordinary connections between space and shape; the works’ geometries, filling the stage, were taut, and their most eccentric departures from orthodox classicism were packed with rhythmic suspense. The corps dances of Balanchine’s one-act “Swan Lake” (1951) looked mint fresh; I noticed details of rhythm and pattern as never before. Balanchine made so many revisions to his “Swan Lake” over the decades that it seems to have been a work in progress. City Ballet’s production differs in some particulars from Miami City Ballet’s, and Ms. Farrell’s differs from both. She has restored the dance of the four cygnets; it is almost exactly the famous quartet (with latticed arms) of Lev Ivanov’s 1895 choreography, but Ms. Farrell gives it a marvelously legato musical accentuation that, even at a brisk tempo, saves it from cute perkiness. The costumes, by David Guthrie and provided by Ballet San Jose, featured knee-length white tulle dresses for the swan maidens; Mr. Guthrie’s décor included a view of swans crossing the lake in family groupings, larger swans shepherding small ones, that deepened the ballet’s drama even before the dancing had begun. “Swan Lake” opened this quintuple bill; the three plotless works — “Monumentum,” “Movements” and “Allegro” — were its centerpiece. At the end came Robbins’s  It was a marvelous, fascinating program — but its most recent ballet was choreographed in 1963. There are important ways in which Balanchine and Robbins still surpass any 21st-century choreographer, and Ms. Farrell’s stagings make Balanchine choreography still feel startling and challenging. But her vision nonetheless avoids the new. And the lead Farrell dancers, though all exhibit signs of special insight into the ballets, are never quite in the top league of America’s finest interpreters. Most have been with Ms. Farrell for several seasons, yet there have been no remarkable new dancer revelations for a while. The lead ballerina,  This remains one of America’s most valuable companies; all those trying to grasp the many aspects of Balanchine should see it. But it seems isolated, provincial, stuck in its own groove, cut off from the larger currents of ballet today. There are many dozens of principal and soloist dancers around the country who could profit immeasurably from Ms. Farrell’s coaching. Her work deserves to be part of the mainstream of American ballet.
