‘The Asphalt Christmas’ Plays Movie Mash-Up
Todd Michael’s “The Asphalt Christmas” is a satirical mash-up of old Hollywood movies, holiday-related and otherwise.

The parochial school’s blond-pigtailed problem child is a cross between little Rhoda in  “I must perform an exorcism,” he tells the girl’s mother. “It’s the only conceivable way to save your daughter and my Christmas pageant.” The good news for audiences at  The bad news is that the 90-minute play, directed by Lawrence Lesher at the Lion Theater, falls flat much of the time. Aiming to be madcap, it dashes off in multiple directions. Sometimes this works, as in the strand involving the possessed girl’s mother, Dixie (Mr. Michael), a ’40s-style dame who happens to be a stripper. More often, it doesn’t. Those who find priests and nuns inherently funny may have the best chance of diversion; “The Bells of St. Mary’s,” “Boys Town” and “The Singing Nun” were among Mr. Michael’s many sources of inspiration for the play, which is set in 1950 — “anachronisms notwithstanding,” the program says. But “The Asphalt Christmas” has a weakness for corn disguised as camp. Take this exit line, delivered by the hammer-wielding Sister Bernadette (David L. Zwiers): “If anybody is looking for me, I can be found at the Nativity display. I’m going to nail Jesus.” Ba-dum-bum. Chris Kateff earns a few nice laughs as Father O’Day, and Courtney Cook does well with several roles, including a nun and a stripper named Bubbles. Presented by Gracye Productions, the play isn’t aiming to warm hearts, but it is rooted in affection for the movies it sends up. It wants to be wacky. Very occasionally, it is.
