The mini-series “One Child” sends a young Chinese-British woman into the heart of China’s capital punishment system.

BEIJING —  It was so important to the British screenwriter Guy Hibbert to preserve the unexpected ending of “ “People wanted us to change the ending,” Mr. Hibbert said in a telephone interview. “I refused.” Commissioned by the  The figure is a state secret, and it’s a subject about which relatively little is known, even here in China. The drama was not shot here: Critically examining state policies on screen is virtually impossible in the face of heavy censorship. Yet if the Dui Hua estimate is correct, the figure is more than in the rest of the world’s combined. Amnesty International says the number of publicly disclosed executions worldwide in 2013 was 778. That excludes China, because no figure is made public here. To Mr. Hibbert, who specializes in political dramas, both the broad issue of capital punishment and China’s particular social realities are disturbing. “I do a lot of stories set internationally rather than genre stories set in Britain,” he said. “I didn’t know anything about China and thought I would quite like to look there.” “I was interested in doing something about corruption,” he added, “because it seems to me corruption destroys the will to live and saps hope.” Communist Party leaders have said that corruption threatens their rule, and the president, Xi Jinping, has begun the deepest anti-corruption campaign in decades and has also recently announced a drive to improve justice. What Mr. Hibbert found on research trips was a country riddled with corruption, where miscarriages of justice are commonplace. Chinese news media regularly feature reports of people executed for crimes that are later attributed to someone else. “There must be a number of those,” Mr. Hibbert said. “And whether you think the death penalty is moral or not,” when it’s used “where the legal system is corrupt, that needs highlighting.” He said he hoped the drama would spur debate about China’s executions the way “ “One Child” opens in London, where Mei, a British college student adopted from China, has received a message on social media from a stranger in Guangzhou, the capital of China’s southern Guangdong province. A birth brother whom she didn’t know existed is in trouble, facing execution for a crime he did not commit. As a foreigner and a blood relative, can she help? But Mei, played by Katie Leung (of the  There follows a tale spanning continents and cultures, not just British and Chinese but also African. Guangzhou has a large African business community that Mr. Hibbert, who has written about western Africa in the 2010 BBC Two drama “ Directed by John Alexander, “One Child” was filmed in London and Hong Kong with some secretly shot images spliced in from Guangzhou. The show’s creators did not apply to shoot within China itself. “We were advised not to do that,” Mr. Hibbert said. “So we didn’t risk it.” For Ms. Leung, whose character is faced with agonizing personal choices as she tries to save her brother, filming was rewarding, but also frightening. “I was very scared before we started shooting,” she said in a telephone interview. “I think it was down to this very sensitive subject. Nobody wants to offend China at the moment, they are such a huge economy and have done great things. But the truth of the matter is that it’s happening,” she said, referring to the executions. For Mr. Hibbert, finding out the details how they happen was extremely difficult, but essential to the plot. “It’s almost impossible to get information about lethal injections,” the method China largely uses, based on the American model, he said. With barely any information available in China, he explained: “It’s a bit like trying to investigate a crime. In order to get a confession, you need to get circumstantial evidence together and collect enough to make you feel you are telling an accurate story.” Of course, executions are an issue in the United States as well, where 39 people were executed in 2013, according to an  “What always strikes me is that support in China for the death penalty mirrors identical support in the U.S.,” Dui Hua’s chairman, John Kamm, said in a telephone interview. Chinese officials are reducing the number of executions each year, Mr. Kamm said. Dui Hua estimates that about  To dramatize the issue, Mr. Hibbert decided the story should be told by a Chinese central character. “I didn’t want the usual way we tell the story, an American hero finds something out in a foreign country,” he said. That led to the figure of Mei, the “one child” of the title, given up by a mother who hoped for a son. Ms. Leung, a drama student at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, whose family emigrated there from Hong Kong, said she knew her ethnicity was important to the role, but that she hoped she isn’t constrained by it forever. Yet “to have the opportunity to play a role with that amount of hope and determination,” she said, “it’s very rewarding.”
