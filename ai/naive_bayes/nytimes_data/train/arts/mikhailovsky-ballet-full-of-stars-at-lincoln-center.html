Mikhailovsky Ballet, Full of Stars at Lincoln Center
The Mikhailovsky Ballet continues its season at Lincoln Center with “Three Centuries of Russian Ballet.”
===
Classicism evolves, Diaghilev said. But from what into what? You might well hope that “Three Centuries of Russian Ballet” — the name of the program presented on Tuesday night by the Mikhailovsky Ballet at the David H. Koch Theater — would show us how the grand sophistication of 19th-century ballet evolved by way of the modernist intensity of the 20th to the cultural complexity of the 21st. Or give us another arc of comparably historical seriousness. This triple bill, however, not only proved depressing and trivial, it also charted a process of flashy thrills and artistic deterioration. The Mikhailovsky dancers are personable, skilled and vivid; and if you care less about choreography than about performers — many balletomanes do — this St. Petersburg troupe is for you. Its stars Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev, who came to international renown while with the Bolshoi Ballet, have long been familiar to New York audiences. Another leading dancer, Leonid Sarafanov, made an impression here with the Kirov (Mariinsky) Ballet in 2008. The Mikhailovsky season is allowing New Yorkers to also become acquainted with Angelina Vorontsova — the former Bolshoi dancer who is chiefly known for her part in the defense of the dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko,  Today’s Mikhailovsky sometimes seems more like the legendary pre-1968 Bolshoi — ardent, go for broke, space consuming — than the Bolshoi of today. No wonder: Its ballet master in chief, Mikhail Messerer, comes from old Bolshoi stock; and Ms. Osipova and Mr. Vasiliev always seemed old Bolshoi in their astounding vitality. Probably, within the politics of Russian ballet, the Mikhailovsky now spearheads the party in opposition to the Bolshoi and its leaders, not only Mr. Filin, but also the resident choreographer and former artistic director Yuri Grigorovich. But it is left with the same basic problem that has been undermining Russian ballet since the 1940s or earlier: choreography that is at best unremarkable and at worst dismaying. This “Three Centuries” program, which really spans less than 120 years, starts with a sweet piece of froth titled “Le Halte de Cavalerie.” This, though no great masterpiece, is the evening’s only choreography of any distinction. It’s attributed to Marius Petipa, who originally choreographed it in 1896 to the vivacious operetta-type tunes of Johann Armsheimer, whose name is omitted from the current Koch Theater program but whose tunes follow the idioms of Offenbach and Johann Strauss II. The story is one of rival flirtations enlivened by the arrival of a hussar regiment. When its colonel, captain and  This production derives from staging by the ballet master Pyotr Gusev in 1975, when the Mikhailovsky was known as the Maly; this was broadcast to the West in 1978  The solos, duets and trios are largely in what ballet folk call demi-character style, emphasizing energy, speed and characterization rather than refined amplitude. The Petipa solo dances, as seen here, all incline to the formulaic: either the Gusev production simplified them or Petipa expected a greater wealth of inflections than modern performers provide. In some ways, the 1978 broadcast showed a company more at home in this idiom than today’s, which gives us a relatively prettified account. As Maria, Ms. Vorontsova shows striking talent and charm without quite convincing us that this is the best vehicle for her; Olga Semyonova, as the red-booted Teresa, is entirely pleasant without giving off the sparkle this character needs to make the narrative irresistible. Mr. Vasiliev has all the panache needed for Peter, though in recent years he has acquired a bad habit of letting us see when he is getting his breath back halfway through a solo. “Class Concert,” As the steps grow showier, the executants change from children to adults and so to stars. Early on, we see dancers hiking their hips sideways to achieve maximum height in extension; and this prepares us for the basically strenuous, graceless nature of this tedious array. Ms. Osipova, Mr. Sarafanov and Mr. Vasiliev were among the stars. Kick, kick; spin, spin; jump, jump; lift, lift. This kind of thing leaves me, though not the audience, cold. Until this year, the Mikhailovsky’s artistic director was the Spanish choreographer  Mr. Duato’s style is all surface effects and all joylessness; though ballet dancers love to think it shows them in a new light, it merely diminishes their artistry. Like all leading Russian ballet troupes, the Mikhailovsky lacks new choreography of distinction.
