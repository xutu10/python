Radioballet Wrestles With ‘The Nature of Love’
The Hungarian dance duo Radioballet presents a duet about the emotional extremes of romance at Abrons Arts Center’s Experimental Theater.

Love is complicated, isn’t it? In case you needed a reminder, the Hungarian duo  In terms of physical build, Ms. Egyed and Mr. Ujvari make an interesting pair. Tall and gangly, she towers almost a full head over her stocky, muscular partner. This discrepancy could have been limiting, but instead it threw open the possibilities for partnering. When Mr. Ujvari lifted and spun Ms. Egyed, his shoulder supporting her waist, or when she sprung over his crouching frame, their differences layered unexpected dynamics over familiar ways of relating. Neither size nor gender circumscribed what they could do. But while “The Nature of Love” takes risks with the mechanics of movement — replete with ambling, acrobatic floor work, at once unhinged and tightly wound — its thematic arc is much safer. Essentially, the dancers fight and make up, telling us little that is new about that age-old process. When they fight, they really fight. The piece begins with Mr. Ujvari standing naked in one corner of the stage, holding a red rose and reciting a love poem. (The text, which continues later with a meditation on the meanings of love, is borrowed from Charles Bukowski and the Hungarian poet Miklos Radnoti.) Ms. Egyed, also naked, sprints onstage and topples him, instigating a serious wrestling match in which biting and strangling (or trying to) are fair game. Eventually, she swipes the rose from his hand and saunters away. Perplexed but unfazed, Mr. Ujvari puts on jeans and a button-down shirt. A solo for Ms. Egyed, in baggy pants and a loose-fitting top, unveils her inner torment as she advances and retreats along a runway of light (designed by Ferenc Payer). Mr. Ujvari, too, seems pretty conflicted as he repeatedly leaps into the air and somehow lands sitting, with crossed legs, literally knotted up. The rote soundtrack delivers one pop song after the next; for all its angst, the choreography matches the music too politely. It takes a while — and a lot of hesitation — but the couple reunites, and nuzzling affection reigns. Having stripped down again, each invites an audience member onto the stage (now strewn with red carnations) for a dance to “How Deep Is Your Love.” It’s a funny, impromptu moment, which “Nature” could use more of. Every relationship needs spontaneity, including the one between performers and their audience.
