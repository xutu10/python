‘What Would Mrs. Webb Do?’ at the Museum of Arts and Design
“What Would Mrs. Webb Do? A Founder’s Vision” details the career of the influential arts patron Aileen Osborn Webb.

Ignore the cheeky title, with its official hashtag (#WWMWD). “ See these shows together while you can, because they balance each other out. More important, they represent the past and future of this small but vital institution (which is being remade by its relatively new director,  It seems natural that the museum, in its quest for a new identity, would want to get in touch with its roots. They lead back to Aileen Osborn Webb (1892-1979), a well-connected philanthropist, patron of the arts and, in the museum’s new parlance, a “maker.” She established the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in 1956 on West 53rd Street. She had founded the American Craft Council in 1939 and, before that, organized cooperatives of craftspeople up the Hudson in Putnam County during the Depression. In a black-and-white photograph from 1965 that opens the exhibition, she is shown seated at a pottery wheel. Below it are a ceramic plate and pitcher of her own creation, as well as a similar-looking piece from her personal collection: a smaller wheel-thrown pitcher by the Bauhaus-trained artist Marguerite Wildenhain. The exhibition, organized by the adjunct curator Jeannine Falino and the curatorial assistant Barbara Gifford, speaks in an annoyingly self-congratulatory voice (through its many texts) but looks impeccable. Its neatness is an effective bulwark against the chaos of “Makers.” Long, double-sided glass cases of smaller objects snake around the gallery, with occasional breaks that create sight lines back to large textiles and furnishings along the perimeter. (Among those bigger highlights are Betty Woodman’s deconstructed-vase of a wall installation; a dresser with sinuous, tusk-like legs and handles by the woodworker Wendell Castle; and a riotous hand-printed and appliquéd fabric wall hanging by Katherine Westphal.) The show is particularly rich in works from the 1950s and ’60s, many of them drawn from and arranged in the order of the large traveling exhibitions organized by the American Craft Council (and, later, the museum). A soigné silver-gilt martini set by John Prip, for instance, was first shown in “Designer-Craftsman U.S.A.,” the 1953 Council-led event that sowed the seeds for the museum. The major American crafts survey “ Archival photographs, deployed selectively, bring to life Mrs. Webb’s craft-related activities and organizations beyond the museum. One shows the artist Harvey Littleton giving a glassblowing demonstration at the first World Craft Council, a fair and symposium conceived by Mrs. Webb and held in 1964 at Columbia. Another photograph reproduces a 1961 article from the magazine “Craft Horizons,” also founded by Mrs. Webb; titled “The New Ceramic Presence” and written by the magazine’s editor, Rose Slivka, it accompanies a powerful display of contemporaneous ceramics by Peter Voulkos. The show weakens somewhat in its second half as it passes the torch from Mrs. Webb to two “contemporary advocates” of craft: the Windgate Foundation (which, we are dutifully told, “has supported the purchase of objects for the Museum’s collection”) and the Museum of Arts and Design board member  Somewhat better is the “Gold Medalists” section, devoted to artists who were recognized by the American Craft Council in an annual prize first directed by Mrs. Webb. The honorees include the ceramist Beatrice Wood, the enamel artist June Schwarcz and the fiber artist Kay Sekimachi, whose delicate weaving of translucent monofilaments is one of the show’s standouts. “What Would Mrs. Webb Do?” might not be the most exciting show ever at this museum, but its seemingly straightforward institutional history holds some clues about the museum’s new direction. With her vision of a museum connected to various networks and marketplaces, Mrs. Webb affirmed craft — or “making,” or whatever you call it — as a deeply social activity and a source of economic self-empowerment. It’s not clear that she would know what to do with some of the work in “Makers,” which includes a smell-enhancing headpiece and a music video by Yoko Ono, but she would probably recognize the show’s collective, progressive drive.
