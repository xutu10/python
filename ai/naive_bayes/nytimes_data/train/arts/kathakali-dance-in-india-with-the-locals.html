Kathakali Dance, in India, With the Locals
The opportunity to feel how the Kathakali spell affects audiences in India deepens the pleasure of watching it.

KANNUR, India —  What forms of dance or theater can compare to the extraordinarily vivid and strange characterizations of the Keralite genre of  Companies and soloists performing Kathakali have come to the West a number of times over the years — sometimes even performing their dance-dramas all night long. So far, however, I’ve been relatively unlucky in the quality and brevity of those I’ve seen in New York. The costumes and makeup are certainly amazing. As either dance or theater, however, the form has looked highly limited. Two recent performances here in the southwestern state of Kerala, however, on consecutive nights, opened up the potential of the art form to me. Each was superb and amazing — while the vast difference between the two has suggested how much ground this genre can cover. And the excitement of watching this idiom in open air amid a Keralite audience — to feel how the Kathakali spell affects those for whom this form is far from rare — greatly deepens the pleasure. The first of these two occurred in Changampuzha Park in Edappally, a suburb of the Keralite city of Kochi. Every seat was taken (several hundred), with many in standing room. The performance was of  Two things about this “Kuchelavrittam” were, for me, revelatory: musicality and mime. Other Kathakali performances I’ve seen have neither featured interesting music nor shown a detailed response to their scores. Here, however, everything was timed and phrased beautifully; and the musicians (standing, not sitting at the side of the stage as in other Indian classical dance forms) were a very close part of the action — sometimes (as often happens in the great sections of flamenco solos) advancing close to the performers for the more intimate scenes. When Kuchela, after calmly wandering in poverty for a long time, returned to his friend Krishna (advancing through the audience to the stage, where Krishna had been conversing with his wife Rukmini), the percussion built up to an overwhelmingly emotional crescendo. But most of the scenes proceeded in long, firm metric structures (I often identified a slow 3/8 tempo, with many fast internal details), which held the audience in its own spell. I noticed that many observers found themselves marking the enchanting beat with feet or hands. This is the spell that the hexameters of Homer or Virgil can cast, or the alexandrines of Racine. The music was primarily percussive — the player of the maddalam was especially fine — but two players, at times, also sang. Tiny expressive effects highlighted specific moments; and every movement showed precisely how it belonged on the beat and within the music’s larger span. Again and again, the arrival of a gesture or step in time with a beat proved a central part of this performance’s beauty. One of the many arguments among Indian dancers concerns which forms truly merit the label “classical” (up to eight are often hailed as such); the musicality of this Changampuzha Park performance made a mesmerizing and exemplary case for the classicism of Kathakali. As for mime, the sustained, intense use of gestures — rhythmically exact but suspenseful, often small-scale but formal — by these three performers was astonishing, even (or especially) to one well acquainted with the great mime scenes of ballet. One mime conversation, between Krishna and Kuchela, lasted at least half an hour. Though I did not understand most of its individual gestures (the famous  Last week, I was able to observe only a little more than an hour of the Kathakali performance that opened the festival at the Ayyappa Temple, Mulagunnathukavu (a suburb of Thrissur); but that afternoon, I had also been allowed to watch the performers putting on their makeup and being made up — a process lasting well over two hours and that builds up an excitement tantamount to pure theater. And what I saw of the performance was rich and action-packed. They enacted “Balivadhom (Killing of Bali),” a tale from the Ramayana. Most of the scenes I watched featured two monkey-chieftains, Bali and Sugriva. There were at least nine performers here (though I observed only five onstage) and eight musicians. The monkey-chieftains were hugely, violently, excitingly, comically, even ludicrously grotesque. Is that why the music showed intensity but no poetry? It was also hard to identify any special musicality of dance style. But the comedy was extraordinary: Bali and Sugriva roared (into microphones), alternated between monarchical majesty and bottom-scratching apian coarseness, and threatened each other across the audience before their confrontation turned into a dialogue. The techniques of Kathakali are astounding to observe at close quarters. The performers not only isolate individual parts of the face (eyebrow, cheek, eyelid), but also trill them at speed. I mentioned the gesture for “bliss”: It is a happy trill for alternating shoulders, indicating that well-being ripples down through the torso. According to the choreographer Frederick Ashton, that is also how the Queen Mother — the last Empress of India — would always respond to the first taste of a dry martini. Yes, bliss!
