The issue of street harassment has received  “Ruddigore,” a parody, and the 10th of the 14 Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, has never achieved the popularity of “The Mikado,” “The Pirates of Penzance” or other works by that duo. But the  The would-be romance between Rose (engagingly rendered by Sarah Caldwell Smith) and the young farmer Robin Oakapple (vividly sung and enacted by David Macaluso) is temporarily thwarted, both by their shyness and by Richard Dauntless, Robin’s foster brother. Dauntless, portrayed with panache by Daniel Greenwood, uncovers Robin’s secret identity — he is really Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd, descendant of baronets cursed to commit a daily crime for all eternity. Robin dutifully struggles to be evil; his “crimes” (including falsifying his income-tax returns and forging his own will) are mocked by the ghosts of his Bad Baronet ancestors, who step out of their own gallery portraits in Act II. They are led by the phantom baronet Sir Roderic Murgatroyd, imposingly rendered by David Wannen. A troupe of bereft bridesmaids sashays throughout the proceedings, bemoaning the lack of weddings in the village and even trying to prompt Rose’s aunt, Dame Hannah (Erika Person), who is committed to singlehood, to marry. Caítlín Burke offered a characterful interpretation of the crazed Mad Margaret, finally reunited with her lost love, Sir Despard Murgatroyd, amusingly rendered by Richard Alan Holmes. Albert Bergeret conducted an often scrappy-sounding orchestra. The camp and slapstick can grow tedious, although there were plenty of comedic moments throughout, like a self-mocking patter trio in which the performers trip over their words. The Gilbert and Sullivan Players have a faithful following, and the large and appreciative audience seemed to enjoy it all thoroughly.
