 Mary Hinkson, a Star for Martha Graham, Dies at 89
Ms. Hinkson, known for her dramatic power, was one of the first two black dancers to join the company.

Mary Hinkson, one of Martha Graham’s most important leading dancers, whose performances from the 1950s through the early ’70s were filled with unbridled dramatic power, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89. Her daughter, Jennifer Jackson Hardy, said the cause was pulmonary fibrosis. Ms. Hinkson, who was one of the first two black dancers to join the  She was a highly versatile member of the Graham troupe. In the title role of “Circe,” which Graham created for her in 1963, Ms. Hinkson exuded a mix of ferocity and subtlety as the sorceress who casts a spell on Ulysses. Coaching her in the role, Graham told her that she must look at him obliquely, as if she were an animal sensing his presence. By contrast, with straightforward serenity and elegance, Ms. Hinkson made the figure in white in “Diversion of Angels,” a signature role, a symbol of love. In the early 1970s she appeared in a revival of Graham’s “Deaths and Entrances” as Emily Brontë, a role Graham herself had danced. Ms. Hinkson stunned audiences with the sharp-angled savagery of her dance of madness in a widely hailed performance. “Mary Hinkson was a goddess Graham dancer,” Lise Houlton, artistic director of Minnesota Dance Theater and a former member of American Ballet Theater,  While teaching a class, Ms. Houlton recalled, Ms. Hinkson might spend 45 minutes walking across the studio floor. “Somehow,” Ms. Houlton said, “the house was on fire when she did it. She had us spellbound.” In 1951 Ms. Hinkson and Matt Turney, her roommate at the University of Wisconsin, became the first black dancers to join the Graham company. With her perfect execution of the Graham dance vocabulary, however, Ms. Hinkson made her reputation as a Graham dancer and was not defined as a dancer who usually explored the black heritage. She resisted being seen through a racial prism, though she acknowledged she would be. “We will have to speak of the ‘Negro dancer’ until people are finally considered only on the grounds of their talent and merit,” she told Dance magazine in 1966. Yet she was aware that she was breaking racial boundaries in the dance world at the height of the civil rights movement. When Ms. Hinkson received the Martha Hill Award, a prestigious dance prize, on Monday, her granddaughter, Elsa Hardy, accepting it on her behalf, recalled that as Ms. Hinkson and Ms. Turney sat by a fountain in Italy while on tour in 1954, they wept on learning of the Supreme Court ruling ending school segregation. Mary De Haven Hinkson was born on March 16, 1925, in Philadelphia. Her father, De Haven Hinkson, was a physician. During World War II, Dr. Hinkson was assigned to establish the station hospital at Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama, the home of the all-black fighter group the  At the University of Wisconsin, Ms. Hinkson’s mentor was Margaret H’Doubler, a pioneering dance educator, who introduced her to Graham’s work. She received a bachelor’s degree there in 1946 and a master’s in 1947. After graduating, she and three other students formed the Wisconsin Dance Group, a small modern dance troupe that toured in the Midwest. The group was interracial and included Ms. Turney, Miriam Cole and Sage Fuller, who later danced as  Ms. Hinkson and Ms. Turney then left for New York University and an eight-week course with Graham there that led to their joining her company. When the Graham troupe was not performing, Ms. Hinkson accepted invitations from other choreographers. She had a periodic association with  As ballet director of the New York City Opera in the 1950s, Butler created roles for Ms. Hinkson in “Carmina Burana,” “Bluebeard’s Castle” and Menotti’s “Amahl and the Night Visitors,” which was televised. During this period she married Julien Jackson Jr. He later bought the D&G; Bakery in Manhattan’s Little Italy. After he died in 1983, the bakery was managed by Ms. Hinkson, her daughter and her niece before being sold in 1997. Besides her daughter and her granddaughter, Ms. Hinkson is survived by her sister, Cordelia Hinkson Brown, and a grandson, Jeremy Hardy.  In 1959, another choreographer, Donald McKayle, who had also danced with the Graham troupe and was interested in the black heritage, featured Ms. Hinkson in the premiere of  A change of pace came when Balanchine invited Ms. Hinkson to dance with his company’s black star, Arthur Mitchell, in Balanchine’s new “Figure in the Carpet” at the New York City Ballet in 1960. Appearing in an imagined 18th-century court divertissement, she and Mr. Mitchell portrayed an African prince and his consort. Walter Terry, dance critic of The New York Herald Tribune, called their performance “exceptionally lively and majestic.” But Ms. Hinkson’s heart belonged to the Graham repertoire, which increasingly provided her with great roles and success in works like “Cave of the Heart,” “Seraphic Dialogue” and “Clytemnestra.” Ms. Hinkson and the dancer  She never regretted leaving, she told Robert Tracy for his 1996 book, “Goddess: Martha Graham’s Dancers Remember.” But, she added, “It does not diminish for one moment my 23-year commitment to Martha Graham.”
