‘Chalk and Soot’ in White Light Festival
In “Chalk and Soot” at the Lincoln Center White Light Festival, John Heginbotham choreographs to silence and Colin Jacobsen has turned to writing vocals.

The choreographer  Clearly, this is delightful fodder for Mr. Heginbotham — a former member of the Mark Morris Dance Group — whose choreography melds blithe innocence with stringent steps. “Chalk and Soot,” performed at the Baryshnikov Arts Center on Thursday, originated after Mr. Jacobsen, a member of the string quartet  Mr. Jacobsen asked Mr. Heginbotham to choreograph, and since Kandinsky was known as a painter and not a poet, they hatched a plan for each to step out of his comfort zone. Mr. Heginbotham would choreograph part of the work in silence, while Mr. Jacobsen would compose vocal music. The ambitious but unconvincing production, expanded since that first iteration, features Brooklyn Rider and five dancers from Mr. Heginbotham’s company and begins with a curious, whistling squeak. In the opening solo, performed in silence, Lindsey Jones enters the stage from the wings, walking on demipoint with bent knees and her hands curved alongside her ears. Wearing a striking black-and-white top, designed by Maile Okamura — a current Mark Morris dancer — she soon speeds up, careering around the stage in quick crossover steps and hops in sous-sus. Making her way to the stage’s exposed wings, Ms. Jones bends at the waist with a flat back and clasps her hands behind her. Here, she looks a little like a Kandinsky figure reimagined as a dunking bird. The position is repeated often throughout the work, yet few moments come close to replicating the quirky spirit of this haunting solo. As scenes come and go, Mr. Heginbotham seems trapped by the brevity of the musical sections, but bursts of brilliance persist: Macy Sullivan, another enthralling dancer, uses her precision and dynamism to bring out the unpredictability of Mr. Heginbotham’s angular movement, which subtly mirrors the flattened style of Kandinsky’s woodcuts or perhaps of Nijinsky’s works. At one point, there’s even a musical reference to “Rite.” Just as integral as the dancers’ steps is the spacing of the Brooklyn Rider musicians, who walk on barefoot in long gowns and assume spots in four corners of the stage. (Gabriel Kahane, on vocals and reed organ, is planted in the center.) During the first half, the musicians frame Mr. Heginbotham’s choreography, rendering a symbiotic exchange between the music and the dance. But in the second act, after an intermission breaks the flow of the two parts and exposes the weakness of the second, they converge at the back of the stage while the dancers perform in the front. It’s not an improvement, even though the excellent vocalist Carla Kihlstedt, wearing a checkered top in the shape of wings, is finally front and center. The problem is the greater whole. “Chalk and Soot” feels stretched thin; beyond frippery, what’s wanting is real oddity.
