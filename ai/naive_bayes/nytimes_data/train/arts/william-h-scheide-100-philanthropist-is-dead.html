William H. Scheide, 100, Philanthropist, Is Dead
Mr. Scheide devoted his life to philanthropic and artistic pursuits striking in their range and depth.

William T. Scheide struck it rich in the Pennsylvania oil boom of the late 19th century and then surprised people by retiring at 42. For him, it was an easy decision. He had made more than enough money to do what he really wanted to do: buy books and read them. William had a son, John, who shared his love for words. John carefully gave some of his money away — to his alma mater, Princeton, as well as to other colleges and to the Presbyterian Church — but he, too, spent most of his life reading and buying books, often rare ones. He built a library at his house in Titusville, Pa., with oak bookcases fronted by leaded glass doors and tables at which to sit and study. John’s son, William H. Scheide, grew up in a bedroom above the library. It was easy to go downstairs, pull up a chair and page through old texts — sections of the Bible on papyrus, a first folio of Shakespeare, a speech about slavery written in Lincoln’s hand. His interests became as diverse as the subjects on the shelves. William Scheide was 28 when his father died and he inherited the family fortune. Over the next seven decades, he also passed down his passions, but to far more beneficiaries. Before his death on Nov. 14 at 100, Mr. Scheide devoted his life to philanthropic and artistic pursuits striking in their range and depth. The library he explored as a boy is now the  Its holdings include  After Mr. Scheide (pronounced SHY-dee) received a bachelor’s degree in history from Princeton, he earned a master’s in music from Columbia. He taught in the musicology department at Cornell University before he began independently researching hundreds of vocal compositions by Bach that were little known and rarely played. One reason he was able to do so was that his personal library included all 47 volumes of Bach’s music, published over several years in the late 19th century. Combing through Bach’s cantatas, Mr. Scheide had an idea. He wanted to extract their arias and duets, pieces mostly performed in worship services, and hear them performed in concert. In 1946, he put his research to work, founding the  He hired accomplished musicians — including, over the years, the flutist Julius Baker, the oboist Robert Bloom, the cellist David Soyer and the soprano Eileen Farrell — and gave them long-term contracts. The group, which made its New York debut in 1948, became an acclaimed ensemble and released numerous recordings. It also drew criticism for playing the pieces out of their intended context. “I think the private Bach is still private,” he said in an interview in 1980, the year he decided to end his financial involvement with the group. “A lot of it is still not well known by important musicians, and they’re missing quite a bit. I know the cantatas get done in churches, but I wanted to put them in the middle of our musical life.” Not long after Mr. Scheide established the Bach Aria Group, he began developing a relationship few people knew of at the time: He became an essential financial supporter of some of the most important legal fights of the civil rights movement, and of the lawyer often leading them, the future Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall of the  Mr. Scheide became active in local civil rights groups while living in Princeton in the early 1950s. When he received a mail solicitation from the Legal Defense Fund, he donated $5. But after Mr. Marshall got word of Mr. Scheide’s interest and his wealth, he asked him to help finance the landmark school desegregation case Brown v. Board of Education. The Legal Defense Fund said last week that Mr. Scheide had been its  William Hurd Scheide was born on Jan. 6, 1914, in Philadelphia, and grew up in Titusville. His mother, the former Harriet Hurd, was a social worker in New York when she met his father. An only child, Mr. Scheide learned to play piano early and majored in history at Princeton only because the university did not offer a music major. Now it does, and Mr. Scheide has been generous to the music department as well as other parts of the university. His wife, the former Judith McCartin, whom he married in 2003, said he died in Princeton in the house where he had lived for more than 60 years. It is on a street called Library Place. In addition to his wife, Mr. Scheide’s survivors include two daughters, Louise Marshall and Barbara Scheide; a son, John; three stepdaughters, Mary Holmes, Carol Taylor and Catherine McCartin; three grandchildren; six stepgrandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. His marriage to the former Lorna Riggs, the mother of his children, ended in divorce in the 1960s. He married his second wife, Gertrude Corbin, in 1971; she died in 2002. Mr. Scheide provided major financial support to many other groups. He gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic causes and candidates, much of it after marrying his third wife, a longtime Democratic activist. He himself was a lifelong Republican. Not long ago, his wife said, she tried to persuade him to switch his party affiliation so that he could vote in a local election. His sympathies, after all, seemed more aligned with the Democratic Party. But he refused, citing his respect for his party’s most admired leader. “He said, ‘I could never do that to Lincoln,’ ” Mrs. Scheide recalled.
