The Agent Jack Tantleff Worked to Bring Back ‘Side Show’
The agent Jack Tantleff worked to bring back the musical “Side Show” to Broadway.

Jack Tantleff thought he knew what the director Bill Condon would say. But when he asked Mr. Condon, “Why ‘Side Show’ and why now?” at a talkback after a recent performance of that  “Because it took you this long to get it together,” Mr. Condon replied to Mr. Tantleff, who heads the Paradigm Talent Agency’s theatrical literary department. The audience had no idea what Mr. Condon meant. After all, agents do their work behind the scenes and have little, if any, interaction with theatergoers. Mr. Tantleff laughed nervously, not used to being the center of attention. But “Side Show” represents a milestone for Mr. Tantleff, a 57-year-old New York native who grew up dreaming of a career in the theater. He boasts 12 clients involved in the revival of that musical, now at the St. James Theater, a third of whom he’s worked with since the show’s short-lived original Broadway production in 1997. Packaging clients is standard practice in Hollywood, where powerful agencies often match the director, writer and stars. It occurs in small batches on Broadway, particularly with celebrity vehicles, but the extent to which Mr. Tantleff has almost the entire creative team of “Side Show” on his talent roster is rare. “He’s the driving force behind this production,” Mr. Condon said in a telephone interview. “There’s no question.” Henry Krieger, the show’s composer, added: “He’s not like most agents. He gets personally involved with the people and admires them for what they can do. He makes lasting friendships.” Among other things, Mr. Tantleff fostered “Side Show” as the first-ever coproduction between La Jolla Playhouse and the Kennedy Center, where the heavily updated version of the musical, about the conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton, had its premiere before His efforts earned Mr. Tantleff a rarely seen title: creative supervisor. Yet he doesn’t have a producer credit and receives no salary. “It actually never occurred to me until now that people might think, ‘Is he getting paid for something?’ ” Mr. Tantleff said, explaining that the only income he brings his agency is Paradigm’s standard 10 percent commission on each contract. “The title is something that will make my mother very happy.” His mother lives on Long Island, where Mr. Tantleff grew up. Being an agent was never his goal, though. He landed a job out of college, typing labels for the producers Michael Harvey and Peter A. Bobley, and found himself as associate producer for a pair of one-acts on Broadway when they asked him to help raise money. Later, he worked as an assistant company manager, responsible for the day-to-day needs of actors and staff. When a show he was working on closed in the early 1980s, Mr. Tantleff heard about a job as an assistant to the agent Clifford Stevens. He didn’t want that kind of work, but when he visited Mr. Stevens’s cold office on an exceptionally hot day, coming from his own non-air-conditioned one, the temperature won him over. (Mr. Stevens now works down the hall from him as a talent agent at Paradigm.) Mr. Tantleff’s journey with “Side Show” started in 1992, when Mr. Krieger, on the hunt for a new agent, handed him a cassette tape labeled “Songs of the Siamese Twins.” Mr. Krieger also introduced him to the book writer and lyricist, Bill Russell, as well as Robert Longbottom, the show’s original director and choreographer, both of whom he signed. “I worked very closely with Henry and Bobby and Bill in a kind of unofficial dramaturgical capacity,” he explained over breakfast on Park Avenue, near Paradigm’s offices. Mr. Tantleff — tall, svelte and usually in a suit and tie — could blend into any crowd of businessmen until he starts talking about theater and his clients, when his eyes light up from behind his dark-rimmed glasses. “I wasn’t part of the creative team,” he continued. “But I certainly was invited into the process in what I considered a very special way.” When “Side Show” closed after 91 regular performances, Mr. Tantleff was devastated. There was talk of bringing it back to Broadway almost immediately, and producers even considered remounting it that same season. It took Mr. Condon to reopen the case for the revival when he directed the film of Mr. Krieger’s “Dreamgirls” in 2006 and mentioned that he’d love to do “Side Show” as his first stage project. Mr. Tantleff was at William Morris Agency (now William Morris Endeavor) at the time. Though Mr. Condon remains a client there, he has continued working with Mr. Tantleff theatrically since his move to Paradigm in 2008. Even considering Mr. Tantleff’s strong ties to the show, it wasn’t a given that his clients would populate the boards. Paul Tazewell was not the first choice for costume designer, but Mr. Tantleff kept bringing up his name, and the people at La Jolla Playhouse agreed, as he had recently designed the complicated Flaming Lips musical,  Mr. Condon met with many choreographers as well. Mr. Tantleff encouraged him to have lunch with his client, Anthony Van Laast, a Briton known for his work stateside on  “At our first meeting, Jack said, ‘The American theater community sees you in one way, but I know what other work you’ve done, and I think you’d be an ideal partner for Bill Condon,’ ” Mr. Van Laast said by telephone from London. “If you look at it on paper, you wouldn’t necessarily put me with him.” Not all of the clients were assembled from the start, however. When the show was in La Jolla, Harry Houdini, a character in the beginning of the show, just walked on and offstage, unceremoniously. Mr. Tantleff thought the moment needed a bit more, well, magic, and presented the team with a relatively new client, Paul Kieve, an illusionist who has also created effects for shows like “Matilda the Musical” and “Pippin.” His other clients on the show are Harold Wheeler, the orchestrator; David Chase, the original arranger; and Sam Davis, the music director and arranger, who stepped in after the original choice got another job. David Rockwell, the scenic designer, is now at Creative Artists Agency, though Mr. Tantleff served as his representative on “Side Show.” He also gained clients along the way. After the Kennedy Center production, the lighting designers Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer asked if he’d represent them, bringing the count to 12. Sitting in Row D at one early “Side Show” performance, the man who put the package together seemed to applaud with the entire surface area of his palms after each number, as if he were watching the musical for the first time. “Did he cry?” an associate asked after the show at Sardi’s. Apparently he has a reputation for tearing up. “Not this time,” Mr. Tantleff said. “How do you feel?” asked Mr. Condon. “Terrified,” he answered. “And excited.”
