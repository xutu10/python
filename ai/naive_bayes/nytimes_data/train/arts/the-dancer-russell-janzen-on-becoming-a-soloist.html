The Dancer Russell Janzen on Becoming a Soloist
Russell Janzen, now a soloist with New York City Ballet, discusses how he learned of his promotion, dancing in “Nutcracker” and the writing program he’s enrolled in.

New York City Ballet specializes in plunging its dancers into deep waters. And unlike most ballet companies, casting is announced just one week before performances; regulars know to keep a lookout for the sporadic surprise of so-and-so, buried deep in the corps de ballet, in a major role debut. Thus it was with Russell Janzen, 25, who grew up in Philadelphia, entered the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet in 2005 and joined the company in 2008. He didn’t emerge in a featured role until 2013, when he was cast as the Cavalier in “The Nutcracker.” But it was during City Ballet’s spring season that he got his big breakthrough in a role usually reserved for senior dancers: the tragic protagonist in the late-Balanchine “Davidsbündlertänze.” Alastair Macaulay, chief dance critic of The New York Times, described it as “the finest account of this role to date.” In the fall season, Mr. Janzen was paired with Teresa Reichlen in Balanchine’s “Diamonds,” and with Sara Mearns in “Chaconne.” After his second performance of “Chaconne,” Peter Martins, the company’s ballet master in chief, came onstage to tell him of his promotion to soloist. Mr. Janzen is tall and handsome, with a slightly geeky quality conveyed by large glasses that he wears offstage. Speaking with Roslyn Sulcas, he admitted, shyly, to having been “academic” at school. Next Saturday, he reprises the Cavalier role in “Nutcracker.” In the winter season, he will appear in Balanchine’s “Cortège Hongrois” and a new work by Justin Peck. These are excerpts from the conversation. Q. What made you start ballet? A. It took quite a long time for you to get solo roles. Was that frustrating?   The real frustration was that I was continually injured in the first years. First one sprained ankle, then the other, a herniated disc, lots of things. Every time I was starting to get somewhere, I’d get injured again. How did you feel when you were cast in “Davidsbündlertänze”?   I thought I’d be lucky to get these roles seven to 10 years from now. When I was learning “Davidsbündlertänze,” I realized that I wasn’t going to be able to bring the kind of maturity and experience to it that dancers like Charles Askegard or Adam Lüders could bring. It is so dramatic and heartfelt, and it has to come from a real place. I can only bring what I have to it. Were you surprised when Peter Martins promoted you midway through the season?   Yes. It was a pretty awesome moment. After our bows, Peter turned to Sara and said: “Congratulate him. I’ve just promoted him!” Do you go to other kinds of live performance?   I try to see as much contemporary dance as I can, and I’ve been making an effort to get to more plays. One summer I did a Gaga workshop with Batsheva dancers. It’s a way of moving that is personal and not restrictive. I was feeling down about my dancing, and it really helped. You’ve been spotted reading Elena Ferrante, and you had a food blog for a while. So you have a life outside dance?   Those are my hobbies: I read and I eat. I don’t read everything, but I eat everything, and I like cooking. I’ve always written a lot, too. I am in a writing program at the New School now. But I don’t know that I’d want to go from one temperamental profession to another.
