The Chinese conceptual artist Xu Bing often gets his inspiration from language and the printed word. In the soaring glass atrium of the Morgan Library & Museum three years ago, he created a floating iridescent cloud of Chinese calligraphy made up of about 400 carved and painted acrylic Chinese characters. He has also invented a calligraphy in which English words are written in arrangements that resemble Chinese-style calligraphy, and created ceramic sculptures that incorporate pieces of movable type. “The Language of Xu Bing,” opening this weekend at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and continuing through July 26, examines his relationship to the written word throughout his 20-year career. His first solo show in Los Angeles, it features a video called “The Character of Characters,” in which he chronicles the importance of language throughout history and its significance in Chinese society in particular. The show also features “Square Word Calligraphy Classroom,” an installation made up of tracing books filled with his made-up calligraphy, which he created to help English speakers understand the art of calligraphy.
