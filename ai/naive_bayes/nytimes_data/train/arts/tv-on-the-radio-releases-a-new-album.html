TV on the Radio Releases a New Album
“Seeds,” the new album by TV on the Radio, is an attempt by the band to stay true to its roots while reaching for new audiences.

Blame David Sitek’s cats, at least in part, for the urgently clanging sound, somewhere between a gamelan and a fire alarm, that opens  Mr. Sitek, the band’s guitarist, keyboardist and producer, has cats that like to chase marbles. So he keeps a bucket of marbles on the piano in his home studio in the Silver Lake section of Los Angeles, where much of “Seeds” was recorded. It’s a place he described — by phone between sound check and a live recording session for the Santa Monica public radio station  One day Mr. Sitek wondered about the sound he’d get if he held down the sustain pedal and poured the bucket of marbles onto the piano strings. He liked the sound, and recorded it. Then he kept going. He played the piano strings with his fingers. He hit them with drumsticks and plucked them with guitar picks. When he dropped a drumstick onto the strings, that sound was definitely a keeper. He recorded it on his iPhone, copied it into a sampler, and looped it. Eventually it would run nearly all the way through “Quartz,” the first song on “Seeds.” That kind of whimsical yet thorough experimentation has been one consistent element since Mr. Sitek and the singer Tunde Adebimpe formed TV on the Radio in Brooklyn in 2001. Strange sounds have often encrusted the melodies sung by Mr. Adebimpe and Kyp Malone, who joined the band in 2003 (followed by the rhythm section of Jaleel Bunton on drums and Gerard Smith on bass). The band’s lyrics, meanwhile, have often called for some decrypting. But at the same time, Mr. Sitek said, “In our own kind of naïve mind, we were making what we thought pop music was supposed to be.” With “Seeds,” TV on the Radio moves closer to actual pop, in small increments that add up to a major change. Lead vocals are now decisively out front. Mixes are less dense and more spacious, allowing fewer distractions from melodies and hooks. The beat is pared back, often programmed and repetitive (sometimes too much so). And the lyrics of most songs revolve around love — love that’s thorny and self-questioning, never saccharine, but love nonetheless. The album makes clear, in hindsight, how much TV on the Radio has always prized sturdy tunes and a kinetic beat, even amid its sonic and rhetorical thickets. And the band has no apologies for clearing away some of its old obstructions. “With songwriting, you can get where you start to overthink things in the name of doing something you’ve never heard or done before,” Mr. Adebimpe said. “You have to go through that. You have to make a mess — to not just know the value of simplicity, but to really appreciate the value of simplicity and the strength of simplicity.” “Seeds” arrives after some crucial changes in the band’s career. Mr. Smith died of lung cancer in 2011, shortly after completing TV on the Radio’s previous album, “Nine Types of Light”; afterward, the band toured with hired musicians. In 2013 TV on the Radio announced it had left Interscope Records, its label since 2006. “They did what they did. That’s as diplomatic as I can put that,” Mr. Adebimpe said, without elaboration, in an  And after their major-label years of working through the constant cycle of recording and touring, the group’s members spent some time apart, reconsidering the band’s future and toying with side projects, among them Mr. Malone’s Rain Machine, Mr. Sitek’s Maximum Balloon and Mr. Adebimpe’s Higgins Waterproof Black Magic Band. One by one, they have gradually moved from New York to Los Angeles. Mr. Sitek, in particular, has also been busy producing singers and songwriters, including a 2008 album of Tom Waits songs sung by Scarlett Johansson and more recent projects with Kittie Harloe and Daniel Ledinsky, songwriters who both contributed to tracks on “Seeds.” But by early 2013, the band was ready to reconvene. “If I want to get a break from samey samey, there’s no better band to get away from regular than those guys,” Mr. Sitek said. “We’ve put so much time into it. We’ve developed a language with each other that’s really hard to rebuild, especially when you’re in your 40s. So I think that when you want to speak that language, you go with the people you built it with.” The band quickly recorded two songs in the spring of 2013,  Soon, Harvest Records — a recently revived label within Capitol Records that has specialized in art-rock from Pink Floyd to Wire — began courting TV on the Radio. Harvest has two general managers, Piero Giramonti and Jacqueline Saturn. In a joint telephone interview, Mr. Giramonti said: “We knew the band and were prepared to commit on that basis. And then we got really, really excited once we started hearing the songs. We felt that they had taken what they’ve done expertly throughout their career and created a new body of work that was true to who they are and also was going to be accessible to a wider audience.” He added: “They’re extremely happy and proud of the base that they’ve established, but they also want their music heard by a wider audience. So there’s a delicate balance between maintaining that fan base, with their foundation, and then opening it up.” “Seeds” is still recognizably TV on the Radio. The songs mesh long melodic lines with jittery inner voices, and they exploit not only the sustained harmonies Mr. Adebimpe and Mr. Malone can create, but also the bite and breaks in their voices. In  “Quartz,” along with its looped clang, has layers of vocal polyphony high and low, sudden and complete changes of texture (which, later, will mesh), massed guitars that sound like a kazoo choir and more questions than answers in the lyrics. The questions are ones that the rest of the songs on the album will continue to ponder. “How much do I love you?” Mr. Adebimpe sings in a voice both long-suffering and contentious. “How hard must we try?” The lyrics grapple with trust, fear, transcendence, loneliness, wounds, healing and “a hot night on the bridge/ the one you’re burning,” as Mr. Malone sings in “Could You.” The chorus of “Trouble,” with euphoric harmonies that look toward the Beach Boys, holds the perfectly ambivalent tidings: “Everything’s gonna be O.K./ Oh I keep telling myself.” So TV on the Radio hasn’t exactly lost its subtleties. “As with most things,” Mr. Sitek said, “where there’s a crunchy outside there’s a chewy center, and vice versa. I think that if you start to unpeel the onion, we’ll all cry, but then you’ll have an onion and it may lend to the sweetness of something else. There are a lot of layers.” Pop may be anathema to music fans who want their bands to stay barbed and insular. But TV on the Radio refuses to equate integrity with obscurity. “There’s a tradition of popular music that is edifying to me on a spiritual and intellectual level, and makes me want to dance, and makes me feel less alien in this life experience, and makes me want to be closer to my friends, family and neighbors,” Mr. Malone said. “If you have something to say and you have beauty to share, I think that having it presented clearly is an act of confidence.” The band has been introducing songs in live shows; it comes to the Apollo on Nov. 19 and the Music Hall of Williamsburg on Nov. 21-22. Mr. Adebimpe has noticed how fans respond to new songs. “By the second chorus I hear people singing along to songs that haven’t been released yet,” he said. “It definitely beats blank stares and silence by a long shot.”
