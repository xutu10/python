Ren&eacute; Pape in a Solo Recital at the Metropolitan Opera House
René Pape, a fixture with the Metropolitan Opera, conjured intimacy as he performed an austere recital on its stage on Sunday afternoon.

Is there a singer on the Metropolitan Opera’s roster more deserving of a solo recital on its stage than  As King Marke in a new production of Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde” in 1999, his Act II narrative, stark yet seductive, became the opera’s moral and emotional climax. In 2010, playing the title role in Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov,” he survived a  He doesn’t exaggerate or grandstand. On some days, this can feel like coolness, even a chill, but most of the time — as on Sunday — Mr. Pape is elegantly restrained, a natural storyteller who draws you in slowly and carefully, yet confidently, rarely grabbing you by the lapels but effective, nevertheless, at making you listen. Mr. Pape, who was joined by the sensitive pianist Camillo Radicke, deserves praise for a program free of crowd-pleasing favorites and austere, even by the standards of a lieder recital. With room for 4,000, the cavernous Met remains a spectacularly misguided setting for songs meant to be heard in a small room by a tiny fraction of that number. But Mr. Pape, unlike the star tenor Jonas Kaufmann in his Met recital  While Mr. Pape was singing Banquo in a thrilling Met performance of Verdi’s “Macbeth” on Saturday, his aria, “Come dal ciel precipita,” seemed briefly to slip out of his grasp, but on Sunday, he was entirely in control of his instrument. His voice has taken on a smokier quality in recent years, even a touch of leather that has nicely troubled the preternatural solidity of his tone. Mr. Pape’s performances grow more affecting the longer you stay with them, as a sense of distance transforms into one of dignity. His first selection, Beethoven’s “Six Songs After Poetry by Gellert” (Op. 48), was the least fulfilling, poised to a fault. The switch to happiness and hope halfway through the final song, “Busslied,” didn’t make its full impact, since the sadness and desperation of the opening hadn’t been vivid enough. But in Dvorak’s “Biblical Songs,” Mr. Pape’s attentiveness to details — his movingly precise enunciation of each syllable of “holubice” (“dove”); his leaning into “zemi” (“heavens”) — was wedded to an overarching gentle grandeur. “God Is My Shepherd” was a hushed, mature prayer, and he bit into the final number, “Sing Unto the Lord a New Song,” with relish. He was as insouciant as he gets in Roger Quilter’s “Three Shakespeare Songs,” and in his element for Mussorgsky’s “Songs and Dances of Death.” By this point, his voice had warmed to a rich beauty that filled these four long narratives, even if that sheer beauty seemed more the point than dramatic pungency. His final encore, “If Ever I Would Leave You,” from Lerner and Loewe’s “Camelot,” summed up the recital: calm, burnished, decorous, gorgeous.
