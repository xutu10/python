A Proudly Unsentimental ‘Nutcracker’ at Paris Opera Ballet
A challenging production of the Christmastime classic.
===
PARIS — “The Nutcracker” isn’t obligatory Christmas fare at the Paris Opera Ballet; it hasn’t been performed here for five years. But this year, Rudolf Nureyev’s production of the ballet is in full swing at the Opera Bastille, although neither the setting nor the ballet feel particularly festive. The Bastille theater is huge, cold and impersonal, Nureyev’s “Nutcracker” exactly the same. There is almost nothing that isn’t strange about this version, nominally based on the original 1892 ballet, choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov to Tchaikovsky’s glorious score for the Mariinsky Ballet. Although Nureyev offers us the traditional party scene, a fight between the Rat King and the Nutcracker, snowflakes and the various national dances that characterize the final act, his production departs from tradition (as well as logic and theatrical sense) in a number of ways. Clara, the ballet’s child heroine, is danced by an adult (on Wednesday night Léonore Baulac) , as is her brother Fritz (Adrien Couvez). It is not the Nutcracker doll that is transformed into a prince, but Drosselmeyer (Germain Louvet), in Act 1 a vaguely menacing but strangely insignificant figure. There are snowflakes, but no Kingdom of the Sweets or Sugarplum Fairy. (Her variation is danced by Clara as part of the final grand pas de deux.) The Russian, Arabian, Chinese and “Pastorale” dances of the second act are performed in the living room setting of Act 1; the conceit is that the family and guests from the party now populate Clara’s dream imagination. Those concepts might be fine if Nureyev had managed to infuse the production with any coherent theatrical logic. But that’s not the case. The adult dancers look unconvincingly childlike. Drosselmeyer, whose gift of the Nutcracker doll sets the plot in motion, has neither mystery nor ambiguity; he is reduced to skulking about in an eye-patch and large cloak in  Without reading the program notes, it’s virtually impossible to understand that Drosselmeyer is also the Prince, and I can’t imagine that many people recognize Clara’s family as the leaders of the national dances. (I didn’t.) The waltz of the flowers has no flowers and little waltz. Instead we get a stiffly regimented corps de ballet in gold costumes and white wigs. Which brings us to the costumes and décor, by Nicholas Georgiadis. These are at first stultifyingly dull, with the gloomiest brown living room ever for the first act (the Christmas tree, a non-event in this version, pushed to the very back of the room) and the party guests in matchingly depressing dark shades. Later, Mr. Georgiadis goes all stiffly opulent in a final scene ballroom setting, complete with candelabra and chandeliers. Neither these settings nor the staging offers the slightest hint of the magical and fantastical; a quality essential to a successful “Nutcracker.” And then there is the choreography. Although it is credited to Nureyev “after” (ballet parlance for based upon) Petipa and Ivanov, parts of this version and its general concept come from a 1934 Soviet production by Vassily Vainonen. But Nureyev wasn’t inclined to leave well enough alone; he never neglects to provide three steps where one will do. The dancing is difficult and awkward-looking in the extreme; strange little beats and accents permeate variations, everything is composed for maximum difficulty; the dancers are frequently late in arriving in poses or on the music because it’s so hard to stuff in all the steps. Nureyev’s instincts are also extraordinarily unmusical. In the mountingly climactic passage that Balanchine uses in his version for the magical growth of the Christmas tree, we get the mice tossing Clara’s doll around for an endless time. For the music during which, in the traditional version, the little prince recounts the story of the battle to the Sugarplum Fairy, Nureyev has cloaked figures with enormous doll heads menace Clara for another prolonged and boring period. There are several moments in the ballet where the ensemble file on in silence and wait for the music to start. It’s almost embarrassingly clumsy. Despite all of this, the Paris company looked better as an ensemble than they have for a while. The children of the Paris Opera Ballet School were engagingly immersed in their characters and dancing. The snowflake corps de ballet was alert and attentive, sometimes even dancing slightly ahead of the beat instead of in the slightly posed, correct manner that the company can exhibit. Ms. Baulac and Mr. Louvet could have used some of that musicality in the principal roles. They are both very young, both only promoted 10 days ago from the corps de ballet to the status of soloist (“sujet” in the Paris Opera Ballet hierarchy) and are clearly major talents. Ms. Baulac is blond and sweet-faced, with a glorious sweeping line and buoyant jump; the dark-haired Mr. Louvet is a danseur noble type, tall and elegant with a lovely refinement to his dancing. They coped with the difficulties of the choreography with admirable finesse and offered a radiant final pas de deux, but neither are as interesting to watch as they might be. Both move with a bland evenness; there is little phrasing or a sense of differentiated dynamics that would bring life and intensity to their dancing. This lack of responsive musicality is a pity, given the technical level of the dancing in this company. The snowflake scene suggests it’s an issue that Benjamin Millepied, the new  The Nutcracker.
