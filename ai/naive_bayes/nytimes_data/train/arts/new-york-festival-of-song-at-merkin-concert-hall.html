During “The Breath of a Rose,” by William Grant Still, set to a poem by Hughes, she shaped the final phrase — “Love is no more than the breath of a rose/ No more/ Than the breath of a rose” — with gorgeous simplicity, the final word dissolving with the delicacy of a falling petal. Another highlight was “I’ve Heard of a City Called Heaven,” in which she sang with both dramatic fervor and quiet poignancy. Mr. Blier and Michael Barrett were the able accompanists; Mr. Blier provided engaging commentary about the historical background of the pieces and the artists involved. He described Billy Strayhorn’s “Day Dream,” expressively sung by Mr. de Haas, as the “most beautiful, intricate chord progression of any popular song I know.” Mr. de Haas and the baritone James Martin didn’t always sing with the polish and sophistication of Ms. Bullock, though both made worthy contributions — including Mr. Martin’s lively rendition of Luckey Roberts’s “Mo’ Lasses.” The lineup also included selections by Eubie Blake, Cecil Cohen, Duke Ellington, William Weldon and Florence Price. Mr. Blier paid homage to the contributions of Andy Razaf, a prolific lyricist who, in addition to the words to “Black and Blue,” wrote the words to Russell Wooding and Paul Denniker’s “What Harlem Is to Me,” which the three singers offered as a fitting conclusion to the evening.
