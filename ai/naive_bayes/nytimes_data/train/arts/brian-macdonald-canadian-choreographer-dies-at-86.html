Brian Macdonald, Canadian Choreographer, Dies at 86
Mr. Macdonald, a director and choreographer, worked with classical, contemporary and regional material, from Bach to Gilbert and Sullivan and on to Leonard Cohen.

Brian Macdonald, a Montreal-born choreographer and director whose inventive work over more than a half-century helped deepen the footprint of Canadian artists in ballet and musical theater, died on Saturday at his home in Stratford,  The cause was cancer, according to a spokeswoman for the Stratford Festival, where Mr. Macdonald directed and choreographed more than a dozen productions. As a choreographer, Mr. Macdonald was known for an eclectic repertoire and a lively melding of classical and contemporary idioms, and in his original works — including “Aimez-Vous Bach?” and “The Shining People of Leonard Cohen,” based on poems by that Canadian writer and singer — he sought source material and inspiration from a range of eras. Perhaps his best-known work was “Time Out of Mind,” danced to music by the 20th-century American composer Paul Creston. An often frenetic mating dance that for some recalled “The Rite of Spring,” it was created for the Robert Joffrey Ballet, which performed the work at its New York debut in 1963 at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. It was subsequently presented by the Harkness Ballet and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, among other companies. “A spectacular showpiece,” Allen Hughes, a critic for The New York Times, wrote after the Delacorte premiere. It is characterized, Mr. Hughes said, by “menacing tensions and suggestions of violence.” He added: “The choreographer’s fluent command of dance speech has led him to fill ‘Time Out of Mind’ with an astonishing variety of movement and gesture. There may, in fact, be too much in the work to make it wholly satisfying artistically. In any case, it is a tour de force made to order for the strength and brilliance of the Joffrey dancers.” On Broadway, Mr. Macdonald choreographed “Maggie Flynn,” a 1968 musical set during the New York draft riots of 1863, starring Shirley Jones, and at Stratford, in 1982, he choreographed and directed the Gilbert and Sullivan favorite “The Mikado” — complete with modern references to Dear Abby and Joan Rivers and other anachronistic touches — that traveled to London, Broadway and elsewhere. For a time in the 1960s he was artistic director of the Royal Swedish Ballet in Stockholm and the Harkness Ballet in New York. On the opera stage, he directed and choreographed several works that toured in Europe and the United States, including Massenet’s “Cendrillon,” presented at New York City Opera in 1988. But he made his biggest mark in his home country, where he championed Canadian composers and designers in his work; in 2002 he became a Companion of the Order of Canada, a government-bestowed honor that recognizes “national pre-eminence or international service or achievement.” In the 1950s and ’60s, Mr. Macdonald was a resident choreographer for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, given credit (by Clive Barnes of The Times, among others) for building its repertoire and helping to raise the company to international prominence. His 1966 ballet for the company, “Rose Latulippe,” which had its premiere at Stratford, was based on a French Canadian tale set in 18th-century Quebec with music by the Canadian composer Harry Freedman. Produced with a grant from the Canadian Centennial Commission, it made use of indigenous folk dances and is sometimes cited as a national benchmark — a thoroughly Canadian full-length ballet. For more than four decades Mr. Macdonald was associated — as a choreographer, teacher and director of the summer dance program — with the Banff Center, a mammoth government-supported educational institute, conference center and performance space in Banff, Alberta, devoted to visual and performing arts. At the Stratford Festival he was best known for his revitalizing work on Gilbert and Sullivan operettas — he directed and choreographed five of them — but his credits there also included more modern fare: “Cabaret,” “Carousel,” “Guys and Dolls,” “The Music Man,” “The Boy Friend” and “Gypsy.” Brian Ronald Macdonald was born on May 14, 1928, to Ian Macdonald, a glass company executive, and the former Mabel Lee. Before he was a teenager, Brian acted in radio dramas. After graduating from high school in suburban Montreal he attended McGill University, where he began choreographing musical revues. After leaving school for a time — he wrote music reviews for a Montreal newspaper for two years — he returned to finish his degree in English. In his youth he was an aspiring pianist, and in the early 1950s he danced with the National Ballet of Canada until an arm injury curtailed that career. In 1957 he directed a satirical revue at McGill, “My Fur Lady,” which toured Canada, including a stop at Stratford, the first of his productions to be performed there. Mr. Macdonald’s first wife, Olivia Wyatt, died in 1959. He is survived by his wife, the former Annette av Paul, a Swedish dancer and ballet director he married in 1964, and a son, Wyatt.
