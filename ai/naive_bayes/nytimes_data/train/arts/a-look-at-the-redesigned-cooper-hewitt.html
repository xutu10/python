A Look at the Redesigned Cooper Hewitt
The revamped Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum encourages visitors to play, not just look.
===
At Pocket Brainstorm, an interactive station in the newly renovated and expanded Cooper Hewitt museum, I have reached into my pocket and pulled out two objects: a thumb drive and a tube of lip balm. Can they somehow be made to work together? This is my assignment. It is part of the Cooper Hewitt’s determined attempt to make visitors start thinking like designers, rather than unreflective observers of beautiful things, and the driving force behind the 14 interactive exhibits and features in the reconfigured museum, renamed Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. Like a new genetic strand, they have been woven into the building’s DNA to make the brain receptive to design’s sacred mission: the union of form and function. This transformation begins on the ground floor of the museum’s home, the old  “Visitors are used to seeing the final product,” said Kim Robledo-Diga, deputy director for education and interpretation. “The idea here is to get them armed before they go into the galleries so they can say more than, ‘Oh, that looks beautiful to me.’ The grander goal is to get them to think about design in their daily lives.” Hence the lip-balm/thumb-drive challenge, which forced me to consider two common objects in a new way. I felt a stirring in the cerebral cortex. How about lip balm in a thumb-drive shape, for thinner lips, not to mention a sporty new look? Or, reversing the equation, a thumb drive that downloads pertinent information about your lips (or remembers your favorite lipstick color)? The right specs might make it possible to apply lip balm automatically, with absolute precision. Some technical work would need to be done, but this idea, it seemed to me, had potential. Was I already thinking like a designer? Nearby, a large tablelike touch-screen Testing Station offered a selection of everyday objects — a winter coat, a bicycle, a plastic pill bottle — waiting to be modified for a mythical client. A banner atop each object issued an invitation: “Design It Better.” Working on a down coat, I tried to satisfy the demands of 3-year-old Olivia, one of several clients who can be summoned by touching the screen. She had a problem, of course. “My mom still helps me put on my jacket,” her profile read. “I want to do it myself.” Olivia was out of luck. Using my finger as a pencil, I made notes on the coat, suggesting tearaway sleeves and lots of Velcro. But did this simply introduce new problems? Maybe radical surgery was required. No sleeves, no zipper, just a sort of cocoon that a 3-year-old could crawl into. Useless in the outside world, but it pushes Mom out of the way. The other solution: Find a new client. With the four building blocks mastered, I wandered off to pursue more interactivity. “Beautiful Users,” a temporary exhibition dedicated to the industrial designer  Once the pose is recorded, an object from the museum’s collection shows up on the screen. I spread my arms. A Japanese kimono appeared, sleeves outspread in imitation of my stance. I struck an action pose, like a runner captured in freeze frame. A 1940 Bakelite radio designed by  Upstairs, on the second floor, the Immersion Room awaited. This is the museum’s pleasure center, with a large touch-screen table that shows more than 200 samples of the museum’s wallpaper collection. Touch an electronic swatch, and a voice holds forth, one of 50 artists — like the textile designer Michael Maharam and the architect Clive Wilkinson — enlisted to interpret the designs, which they do briefly and insightfully. The fun starts when you make your own wallpaper design, drawing lines on the screen with your finger. A color menu presents an extensive palette. The line thicknesses can be varied. In pasta terms, you can swell the line from spaghetti to bucatini. The design is instantly projected on three walls in a repeated pattern that can be reduced or enlarged and subjected to all sorts of other manipulations. I started with a kind of long-division symbol merged with a full colon. On the table, it looked feeble. Splashed all over the walls, and repeated hundreds of times in a close pattern, it looked brilliant. I tried a simple grid pattern, wiggly and brightly colored. Same effect. For inspiration, I called up a 1930s design of stars and planets in muted silver and blue, then riffed on it, drawing a crudely rendered Saturn and rings, with a shooting star off in the corner. Projected on the walls, it looked like sheer genius, and it was then that the truth began to dawn on me. Almost any combination of lines and colors, projected on a wall and replicated ad infinitum, looks pretty good. There are no losers here. The finger-painting gets a little more challenging at a large table display that shows 4,000 of the museum’s permanent collection of more than 210,000 objects as a river of digital images, flowing by like conveyor-belt sushi. You can isolate any one with the touch of a finger, group it with related objects in the collection and then try your hand at designing a table, vase, lamp or chair. On a grid, the design appears as lines and points. Fiddle with the lines and points, dragging them this way and that, and the form changes. Tap “chair,” “table,” “lamp” or “vase,” and the same form assumes different guises, which can be modeled in different formats: 3-D, planes and lines. The possibilities here are infinite, if you have a feel for form and spatial relationships. If, like me, you don’t, the exercise might remind you why you earned a C in ninth-grade geometry. No special aptitude is needed to sit for what one museum official called “a sand selfie” at the SketchBot, a large plexiglass box with a robotic arm and stylus that can translate your digital photograph into a portrait in sand. In theory, this illustrates the importance of drawing in design Well, O.K. Claw vending machines, the ones filled with toys that you try to snatch with a joystick and grappling hook, also communicate an important message — you can’t always get what you want — but they are not normally thought of as teaching aids. They are entertainment. Not far from the SketchBot, another transparent box also delivers interactive thrills, with a whiff of the midway attraction. A field of plastic cubes, arranged tightly like a Scrabble board, can be activated by touch screen and made to move up and down in meaningful patterns that illustrate wave action, mathematical equations for three-dimensional forms, and changes in a city’s traffic patterns over a day. Because the gizmo, called InFORM, was designed by the Tangible Media Group at M.I.T., the city is Cambridge, Mass. Or, totally mindlessly, you can wave your hands around and make the cubes chase a red rubber ball. All the above can be retained, forever, in the fat electronic pen that will be handed out to each museum visitor starting early next year. Scanning the admission ticket sets up a site reached through the Cooper Hewitt website. Anything visitors touch with the tip of the pen goes to the website for later access: wallpaper patterns, DIY designs, museum objects and wall labels. The pen — which must be returned, by the way — is its own object lesson. “If you’re given a pen, it’s explicitly telling you to do things,” said Seb Chan, the museum’s director of digital and emerging media. “We could have made it resemble a museum security pass, but then it would have felt like going to work.” That’s not the idea at all. Design is fun. You’re going to play.
