Changes at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam
A redesigned Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam shows this artist as a genius, but not an isolated one.

AMSTERDAM —  At the end of Vincente Minnelli’s 1956 film, “Lust for Life,”  This enduring image of  But curators at the  It won’t be easy to change perceptions: Many people can’t divorce the dramatic facts of van Gogh’s personal life (the severed ear, the suicide) from his artworks.  The Van Gogh, which owns more of the artist’s work than any other museum — including 200 paintings, 500 drawings and 900 letters — has spent about 10 years planning the reorganization of its collection, which had remained largely static for 25 years. After being closed for seven months for a building renovation, it reopened in May 2013 with a temporary exhibition. In recent months, curators have gradually put in place a permanent display that mingles in works by other artists to create a new context. The configuration, designed to last at least 10 years, was completed late last month. “It’s more a total picture now,” said  While there are about the same number of his canvases on display (about 100), including masterpieces like “The Bedroom” (1888) and “Sunflowers” (1889), the collection now spans four floors of the main wing and is interspersed with works by artists who influenced van Gogh’s aesthetics, as well as with his own drawings and letters. Instead of traditional white walls, the museum has painted each of the galleries a different color to draw out what are called the “moods” of his various periods. The display is meant, curators say, to show that van Gogh was not an isolated genius painting straight from the heart, but rather a meticulous, methodical artist who learned by studying the work of his contemporaries and then found his own unique expression. “In our old presentation, we were very good at keeping up the myths about van Gogh, focusing too much on details and not on the broader view of his art, taking into account his intentions and ambitions,” Ms. van Dijk said. For example, she explained, in a wall text for “Garden of the Asylum” (1889), “we would say that at that time he was ill, and because of how we phrased it, it sounded like the painting was a reflection of his illness and his time at the asylum. It was more subtle than that. But by repeating that kind of detail all the time, we gave the idea that his personal issues had a direct influence on his art production.” She added, “It’s not as intertwined as we suggested in the past.” Drawing from about 20 years of technical research on his paintings and insights gleaned from his full  Visitors first see large screens with depictions of van Gogh from popular media, including stills from “Lust for Life.” Next, they enter a large gallery that holds van Gogh’s self-portraits and his only surviving palette (on loan from the Musée d’Orsay in Paris). Then, they can move through a more or less chronological sequence of rooms showcasing van Gogh’s works alongside artists of the 19th and early 20th century who influenced his approach or whom he influenced. They include so-called painters of peasant life, like Léon-Augustin Lhermitte and Jozef Israëls; Impressionists he met in Paris, like Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro; and closer friends, including Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin. Most of van Gogh’s letters are addressed to his brother and confidant, Theo, and provide insight into his struggles with developing his style and give a glimpse of his troubled personal life. Connections are also highlighted using graphics charting connections both personal and artistic, to challenge the notion that the artist lived and worked alone. Some van Gogh experts have taken issue with the museum’s approach, saying it tries too hard to “normalize” van Gogh. Fred Leeman, who was chief curator of the Van Gogh Museum from 1987 to 1997 and is now an independent art historian and curator, saw the new installation and said he felt that it went too far. “In my opinion, it’s sometimes too much not van Gogh,” he said, especially because the chronological display now begins with a full wall of works by other painters. “When you connect him to all his contemporaries, then you’ve got a kind of reductionism.” Mr. Leeman argues that van Gogh’s personality — and, yes, isolation and madness — may have been part of what made his work so lasting. “We know now that he wasn’t just a normal guy,” he said. “He was a little bit crazy, and this craziness was part of his mental makeup. It was part of what allowed him to be the great painter that he was.” But others approve. Rachel Esner, editor of the 2010 scholarly anthology “Vincent Everywhere,” said she welcomed the idea of “normalizing van Gogh.” “It’s important that we don’t idolize and romanticize artists and turn them into isolated geniuses,” she said. Another van Gogh expert, Steven Naifeh, a co-author of the 2011 biography “ “He lived an incredibly isolated life, but that shouldn’t mean he wasn’t influenced by other artists,” Mr. Naifeh said. “He spent a lot of time in art galleries and visiting studios, looking at the work of his peers.” Sjraar van Heugten, who was the head of collections at the museum for 23 years, until 2010, said that in the end, visitors to the museum will still come away with a sense of van Gogh’s revolutionary talents as an artist. But to do that, he added, “You have to have the correct balance between van Gogh and the world.”
