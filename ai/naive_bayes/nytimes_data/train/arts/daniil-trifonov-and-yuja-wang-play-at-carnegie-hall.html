Daniil Trifonov and Yuja Wang Play at Carnegie Hall
The superstar pianists Daniil Trifonov and Yuja Wang gave annual concerts at Carnegie Hall within days of each other.

Even at Carnegie Hall, a coincidence like this is rare. Superstar pianists are usually spaced at decent intervals throughout the season, but this week, in a quirk of the calendar, perhaps today’s two most prominent young pianists —  As it turns out, they share the impetuosity of youth and frankly unfathomable abilities, but that’s about all. Mr. Trifonov is all angles at the keyboard, his neck at times horizontal over the keys, his nose inches from his hands, his wrists arched high, then bent low. Inelegance escapes Ms. Wang, despite a tigerish attack, her body shaping rhythms as keenly as her fingers seek them out. Moreover, these two are taking quite different approaches to building a career. Take the repertoire. Ms. Wang plays it safe. In her  Admirably, she’s waiting to tackle pieces that she thinks require more maturity, and her rare foray into the Austro-Germanic heartland here showed why. Delicate voicings and sublime colorations could not hide fussiness of detail and structural uncertainty in Schubert’s A major Sonata (D. 959). But those same qualities, along with her innate ear for rhythm, make her Scriabin so satisfying. In a dreamy progression through six of his works, the Fantasy in B minor (Op. 28) had a giddy, oracular haziness; three preludes, a poised regret; and the Ninth Sonata — the “Black Mass” — an enigmatic brutality. By contrast, Mr. Trifonov is going all in, with a high-stakes bid for greatness. Both pianists may have played the Liszt Sonata at their Carnegie recital debuts, but  All of them. Let’s put that in perspective, shall we? “ So Mr. Trifonov’s flabbergasting, exhausting achievement was not merely ambitious for a prodigy. According to Carnegie’s archives, Mr. Trifonov is just the fourth pianist to have dared to play the complete dozen in the main hall.  A case of talent gone mad, then? A simple show? Absolutely not; this was technical facility used for higher ends. Sure, Mr. Trifonov might have evoked a more distinct atmosphere for each of the poems, especially in “Paysage,” or even reined in the speed for a more visionary grandeur in “Eroica.” But among all of its octaves and precise, almost anatomical detailing of hooves and muscles, the nearly unplayable “Mazeppa” had a remarkable nobility and a demonic, almost tragic valor. “Ricordanza,” an isolated moment of peace, possessed a quiet radiance, its dappled rolls glowing with the faintest of dwindling light. Yet perhaps the Beethoven best showed Mr. Trifonov’s true potential. Here was an intellectual task, the kind of thing Ms. Wang sensibly avoids. It’s an extreme work, and Mr. Trifonov gave it an extreme reading, (too) full of ideas, from the rolling thunder and fanfares of the introduction to a daringly unwise, somehow effective immoderacy of tempo relationships. Not for him the analytical revelation of structure — rather a feeling of active discovery, the sense of creating, conjuring Beethoven’s structures on the fly. Imagine what he might achieve in years to come.
