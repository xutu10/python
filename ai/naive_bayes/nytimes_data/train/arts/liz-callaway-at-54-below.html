Holiday cheer may be easy to simulate onstage, but it’s not often that a Christmas show spreads tidings of comfort and joy or party spirits that don’t feel forced and a little desperate. But for the Broadway singer  Ms. Callaway has a bright, sunny voice, tinged with yearning, in which an encouraging smile seems embedded. Her musical personality is a lot like that of Petula Clark, whose 1960s hit “I Know a Place” opened the show. Ms. Callaway’s Christmas CD, “Merry and Bright,” from which she sang several selections, is perfectly named. The figure she most resembled was an enthusiastic camp counselor rallying her charges on a school bus. Her show, directed by her husband, Dan Foster, with Alex Rybeck on piano, Jered Egan on bass and Ron Tierno on drums, is a mixture of Broadway songs and seasonal fare, secular and sacred. The show was a family affair in which she introduced her son, Nick Callaway Foster, a formidably talented young baritone with whom she sang “The Prayer,” a Josh Groban favorite. Her sister Ann Hampton Callaway joined her for a medley of “Silent Night” and “Mary, Did You Know?” There were just enough discordant moments to keep the show from tilting into saccharinity. The wittiest was the amazingly prescient “What Do We Do? We Fly!,” from the 1965 Richard Rodgers-Stephen Sondheim musical “Do I Hear a Waltz?” Written during the golden age of air travel, this hilarious song identified passengers’ frustrations even in the good old days, a reminder that before you go home for the holidays, you face the nightmare of getting there.
