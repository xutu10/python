Kent Tritle and Musica Sacra Bring ‘Messiah’ to Carnegie
Handel’s “Messiah,” a tradition of the Christmas season, came to Carnegie Hall with Musica Sacra under Kent Tritle.

I once knew a Jane Austen scholar who emphasized that seemingly accessible author’s unknowability. When you read Austen carefully enough, my professor would say, every sentence is mystifying. If there’s a bit of overstatement in that, there’s a lot of truth, too. Underneath the ostensibly placid surfaces of some of the art that we cherish as cozy and comprehensible, there are unexpectedly mystifying sentences, perplexing arias and dark, festering depths. This is as much the case with Handel’s “Messiah,” which the chorus  It is the responsibility of those who present “Messiah” to fight this lulling trend, to assert the work’s strangeness and intensity, to seduce but also disorient its listeners. Musica Sacra and its music director,  The polished choristers were the performance’s highlight. Mr. Tritle has prepared a crisply resonant, warmly smooth-sounding group that sings with clarity yet without a hard edge, as penetrating in ethereal quiet as in full cry. In the early chorus “And He shall purify,” the sopranos’ rippling lines had the precision of pinpricks. Yet there was a sense that this was beautiful music existing merely to be beautiful. While the tone was focused, the meaning was not; the number didn’t burn. “All we like sheep” was sung with elegant legato and ended in stark loveliness, but it had little excitement. Mr. Tritle’s conception of the work, its pulse generally on the deliberate side, tended to feel mellow, characterized by gracefulness more than passion and extracting little impact from the contrast in the transition from “Surely He hath borne our griefs” to “And with His stripes we are healed.” There were exceptions, including some feverish orchestral playing to bring in the solo tenor’s recitative “All they that see Him.” (Elsewhere the musicians were solid, with a strong trumpeter, Scott McIntosh, and an occasional hint of string squalliness). There was bite to the chorus “He trusted in God” and a light yet sweeping quality to “Their sound is gone out.” But the momentum never really built across the work’s long spans. After showing flashes of roiling energy as the second part went on, the climactic “Hallelujah” chorus was a letdown: unaccountably mild, with a genial start and no hint of ecstasy. The four young soloists were alert and accurate but rarely more than that. Without much body to their sounds, the soprano Lianne Coble and the mezzo Sylvie Jensen struggled to convey emotion. Mr. Tritle took their dual aria “He shall feed His flock” at a tempo too slow for these singers to fill with feeling. The tenor Lawrence Jones’s lucid diction made his plangent, slender voice seem more present than it otherwise might have, and while the baritone John Brancy sounded distant when his arias went low, he was steady and exultant in “The trumpet shall sound.” It was, all in all, an accomplished, intermittently powerful performance. But “Messiah” can be much more than that.
