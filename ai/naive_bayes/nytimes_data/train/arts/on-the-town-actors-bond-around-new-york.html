‘On the Town’ Actors Bond Around New York
The three lead actors of the musical “On the Town” bond around New York even when they’re not in their roles.

Three sailors on a 24-hour furlough in New York City have one thing on their mind, and it isn’t seeing the  Early in the show, in the classic number “New York, New York,” the boys do make a plan to get to the statue. New York’s “a helluva town,” the lyrics proclaim, and they want to cram in as much as possible. “10:30 Bronx Zoo, 10:40 Statue of Liberty,” suggests Chip, the youngest sailor, paging through a guidebook. His buddies Gabey and Ozzie have other, bawdier ideas. High jinks (and hip-thrusting) ensue, and they never make it. But on a recent Friday, the actors playing Gabey, Chip and Ozzie — Tony Yazbeck, Jay Armstrong Johnson and Clyde Alves — decided to see the monument up close. “Should we do the number?” Mr. Alves said as their ferry, crowded with tourists, pulled away from Manhattan. They didn’t, but an afternoon spent with them had plenty of camaraderie and cheer. And jokes. “Fellas,” Mr. Yazbeck said, as he looked up at the statue, “that’s the girl for me. I’d like to meet her today.” Mr. Armstrong Johnson, deadpanned: “Yeah. She’s 2,580,000 pounds.” In the show, Gabey pines for a beauty queen called Miss Turnstiles, played by the ballerina  The three leads, all veteran musical theater performers, already knew one another — Mr. Yazbek starred opposite Patti LuPone in “Gypsy”; Mr. Alves and Mr. Armstrong Johnson were both in the touring company of “A Chorus Line” — and drove up to the Berkshires together, in Mr. Alves’s Jeep, for the maiden run of “On the Town”  “We took our first bro trip,” Mr. Armstrong Johnson said. Mr. Alves said, “Most of it was Jay riffing.” That they all transferred to Broadway — along with most of the Barrington Stage cast — was a calculated risk in an era when star names are a drawing card for musicals, whether onstage ( “There was never a doubt in my mind that if we were fortunate enough to come to Broadway, it was imperative to bring those boys along,” said John Rando, the production’s director. “There was a chemistry between them that was undeniable — an effervescence and punch at the same time. That’s not easy to find again.” Their bonds were further cemented when they filmed an “On the Town” promotional video back in the city, singing  The shoot was guerrilla style — “We got kicked out of the Plaza Hotel,” Mr. Armstrong Johnson said — but they looked authentic enough. “Everyone’s like, ‘Thank you for your service,’ ” Mr. Yazbeck recalled. “We were like, ‘You’re welcome.’ You don’t want to ruin the dream.” Roaming Liberty Island in civvies — jeans and a leather motorcycle jacket for Mr. Alves, 34; a bomber and plaid scarf for Mr. Yazbeck, 35; and a jersey coat for Mr. Armstrong Johnson, 27 — they were excited for the downtime. Mr. Yazbeck had used a two-day break after opening night to  As the threesome climbed five uneven flights to an observation deck at the pedestal of the statue, they reminisced about their first walk-up New York apartments and discussed the rigors and joys of their two-and-a-half-hour show. It is, they all agreed, the most difficult one they’d ever done. But the response has been worth it. Every night, people “hoot and holler,” said Mr. Armstrong Johnson. “It makes you want to do an extra pratfall.” He paused. “What the audience doesn’t see is the kneepad and the ankle brace.” Mr. Alves: “And your fake leg.” Mr. Yazbeck: “Guy’s got a fake leg!” Mr. Armstrong Johnson: “If I had a fake leg, I’d have the Tony in the bag.” One big difference between earlier “On the Town” stagings and this one is that the male leads sing and dance through all their numbers, including an eight-minute dream ballet with Mr. Yazbeck and Ms. Fairchild. (Joshua Bergasse did the choreography, drawing on Jerome Robbins’s original style.) In one preview, Ms. Fairchild’s elbow smashed Mr. Yazbeck’s chin. He continued dancing, with blood dripping, finished the show, then went to the hospital and got seven stitches. There are no scars, thought they might have been appropriate for a macho sailor. Nor did the performers have to get naval haircuts. (“I do not look good with a buzz cut,” the wavy-haired Mr. Armstrong Johnson whispered.) Inspired, perhaps, by the patriotism in the show, which begins with “The Star-Spangled Banner,” the actors lined up for selfies in front of Lady Liberty. Later, over burgers and sodas on shore, they admitted that, in some respects, they were quite similar to their characters. It was Mr. Alves who invented the lascivious hip swivel that the guys do when they meet their gals. “Through physical connection, it allows them to find the emotional connection, which,” he added, “is the exact order that I like to do things in.” Mr. Armstrong Johnson, matter-of-fact, said, “I told my boyfriend, ‘You’re my rebound, cool?’ ” Three years later, they’re still together. Mr. Yazbeck, the softy: “I told my wife I loved her before I kissed her.” Their dude-ish rapport didn’t require much rehearsal, for which they’re grateful. “The three of us always connect, right before the show starts,” Mr. Yazbeck said. “We look into each other’s eyes, and we remind ourselves that we’re actually living our dreams.” Visiting the Statue of Liberty, they all said, was unexpectedly moving, a way to appreciate New York from another perspective. It’s in line, too, with the themes and history of the show. “John Rando didn’t want this to be some flouncy musical with just singing and dancing and laughter,” Mr. Armstrong Johnson said. He added that Mr. Rando, the director, emphasized that, for countless military personnel, “this was real.” Waiting backstage, the cast sings the national anthem along with the audience. “It revs us up,” Mr. Yazbeck said. Mr. Alves: “It totally grounds me.” Mr. Armstrong Johnson: “And you’re Canadian.”
