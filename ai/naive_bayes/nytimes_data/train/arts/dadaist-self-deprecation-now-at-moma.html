Dadaist Self-Deprecation, Now at MoMA
The French-born Dadaist Francis Picabia’s first photomontage, “Tableau Rastadada” (1920), is now part of the Museum of Modern Art’s collection.
===
Francis Picabia, the French-born painter, poet and leading figure of the Dada movement in the late teens and early 1920s, often took delight in producing work filled with hidden messages, double meanings, mysterious puzzles and in-jokes. “Tableau Rastadada,” from 1920, is a prime example. “It’s Picabia’s first photo collage,” Christophe Cherix, chief curator of drawings and prints at the Museum of Modern Art, said this week, standing in a conference room where “Tableau Rastadada,” a recent acquisition, was propped on a table. Although MoMA is already rich in holdings by Picabia — 10 prints, nine paintings and eight drawings — there was no doubt when Mr. Cherix saw the collage last June at Art Basel, the annual contemporary art fair in Switzerland, that the museum had to have it. “We all knew this work, because it has been included in every major survey of Picabia’s, and we were surprised to see that it was for sale,” he said, adding that he spotted it within the first half-hour after the fair opened and instantly reserved it. The title of “Tableau Rastadada,” one of Picabia’s few photomontages, translates as “Painting Rastadada,” incorporating an abbreviation for the French word “rastaquouère,” or roughly rich, foreign upstart. (Today’s equivalent would be the American term Eurotrash.) In the center is a photograph of Picabia attributed to Man Ray, which Picabia reproduced in the November 1920 issue of his journal 391. He has inscribed the work, graffiti style, with “Vive Papa/Francis/Le Raté” or “Long Live Papa Francis, the Failure.” He also spelled out “Picabia le Loustic” (“Picabia the Joker”) running down the side of his head, and sliced away various details of his face. “He’s presenting himself as a loser,” Mr. Cherix said. “And that’s O.K. Dada was against everything, including success.” Also included in the photomontage are clippings of women’s feet in high heels that Picabia appropriated from a fashion magazine. There is a purposely-too-small bowler hat perched on his head and a pipe emerging from one nostril. “It’s pre-everything — Conceptual, Pop, Surrealism,” Mr. Cherix said. “Tableau Rastadada,” will be included in a major Picabia retrospective, scheduled for November 2016, being organized by Anne Umland, a curator of painting and sculpture at MoMA. MYTHOLOGY AND MEDIA Peter M. Brant, the newsprint magnate and art-world personality, has been getting a lot of attention for the exhibitions he organizes at his five-year-old Brant Foundation Art Study Center in Greenwich, Conn. While some collectors and dealers say his shows cleverly promote the artists he collects — everyone from Warhol and Basquiat to Julian Schnabel and Dan Colen — others praise Mr. Brant for his keen eye and instinct for collecting artists well before everyone else. His forthcoming show, “Deliverance,” opening Nov. 10 (by appointment only), centers on four American artists from his collection — Larry Clark, Cady Noland, Richard Prince and Christopher Wool — whose work is rooted in American mythologies and, like Warhol and Lichtenstein, incorporated mass media from the 1960s and 1970s to comment on the world around them. But instead of showing examples that span their careers, Mr. Brant is concentrating on their production from 1970 to 1997. “It’s when they were really exploring the same kind of themes, and when they each produced some of their best work,” Mr. Brant said. In addition to works from his own holdings he has borrowed works from the artists themselves and from other collectors. The show will include “Tulsa,” a 1971 collection of black-and-white photographs by Mr. Clark; “Cowboy With Holes, Eating,” a 1990 silk-screen of a craggy cowboy on aluminum plate by Ms. Noland; examples of Richard Prince’s cowboy and girlfriend series; and word paintings including “Apocalypse Now” from 1988, by Mr. Wool. “These works really talk to each other,” Mr. Brant said. While there are no plans yet for the show to travel, once it closes on April 1, other exhibitions from the foundation have done so. A 2013 Julian Schnabel show went to the University of Michigan Museum of Art in Ann Arbor this summer. Mr. Brant’s Warhol exhibition last year traveled to the Palazzo Reale in Milan and the Fondazione Museo Roma (Palazzo Cipolla). “Eleven thousand people saw the show in Greenwich, and a total of 425,000 saw it in both Milan and Rome,” Mr. Brant said. In a few years, many of these shows will find a home in New York. After the artist Walter De Maria died last year, Mr. Brant bought his Manhattan studio, a former Con Edison substation at 421 East Sixth Street, as an exhibition space. “We plan to open it in a few years,” Mr. Brant said. “Right now, we’re clearing it out. Construction should begin in another month.” SEE WHO SALUTES When Sotheby’s announced that it was planning to sell one of Jasper Johns’s “Flag” paintings in its contemporary art auction on Nov. 11, the name of the owner was not revealed. The 1983 canvas is small (a little under 12 inches by 18 inches), and its rough encaustic surface — created from pigment suspended in wax — is similar to the “Flag” paintings Mr. Johns created some 20 years earlier. While Sotheby’s won’t name the seller, dealers familiar with the painting say it is Mark Lancaster, a British artist and set designer who worked for Mr. Johns in the mid-1970s and 1980s. An email to Mr. Lancaster seeking confirmation was not answered. “The surface is so rich, you can’t help but want to touch it,” said Alexander Rotter, co-head of Sotheby’s contemporary-art department worldwide. It is estimated to bring $15 million to $20 million. The last “Flag” painting to come up for auction was in 2010, when Christie’s sold one from the 1960s that had belonged to the writer Michael Crichton. It brought $28.6 million.
