‘The Pyramid,’ With Denis O’Hare and Ashley Hinshaw
An archaeological team and a documentary crew get stuck in an ancient Egyptian tomb in “The Pyramid,” starring Denis O’Hare and Ashley Hinshaw.

In  The film is another example of the found-footage genre, in which the movie you’re seeing has supposedly been shot, at least partly, by its characters. One camera belongs to a NASA rover, which is damaged after venturing into the recently discovered pyramid. The humans go in after it. “Imagine,” says Sunni (Christa Nicola), the documentary’s director. “The last people who walked these tunnels died thousands of years ago.” She fails to wonder whether that’s a bad sign. Viewers also shouldn’t ask questions, like who could be filming overhead shots. A father-daughter archaeologist pair, Miles (Denis O’Hare) and Nora (Ashley Hinshaw), share exposition duties, reading the hieroglyphics to understand what might be down there. (Miles pleads with everyone not to use the word “curse.”) The answers aren’t satisfying, and “The Pyramid,” despite an unpretentious matinee vibe, is mostly interesting in seeing how little light can be on screen before a bare minimum of suspense and coherence dissipates. There is, truly, not much to see in this movie.   “The Pyramid” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Toxic air, wild animals, giant spikes.
