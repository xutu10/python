Henry Threadgill Festival at Harlem Stage
“Very Very Threadgill,” a two-day music festival at Harlem Stage, celebrated Henry Threadgill’s legacy and influence in the American avant-garde.

During his introductory remarks at the Harlem Stage Gatehouse on Saturday night, Henry Threadgill succinctly noted that no amount of accolades could mean more to him than the support of a community of musicians engaging with his work. That reasonable assertion helped set the terms for “Very Very Threadgill,” an ambitious two-day festival of his music, and a celebration of  Mr. Threadgill, 70, made no further appearance onstage on opening night; he didn’t play a note on alto saxophone or flute, nor did he conduct any of the performances. But the program, conceived and curated by the pianist Jason Moran, still resounded clearly with his personality, by way of the music’s lunging idiosyncrasies and relentless spirit of enterprise. The title of the festival — a play on Very Very Circus, one of Mr. Threadgill’s  Mr. Moran, who has hailed Mr. Threadgill as his all-time favorite composer, organized the festival as a free-spirited tribute, with the audience seated at cabaret tables rather than the usual theater risers. Sunday’s concert, in the afternoon, was built around new versions of Very Very Circus and Mr. Threadgill’s  Air, originally a trio with the bassist Fred Hopkins and the drummer Steve McCall, was one of the most critically acclaimed jazz ensembles of the 1970s, its pliable approach underscoring deep ties to the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians. Mr. Moran’s revision of the group featured some intermittent piano, with Steve Lehman and Darius Jones each striving to fill Mr. Threadgill’s alto saxophone chair (and, in a spellbinding duo arrangement of “Keep Right on Playing Thru the Mirror Over the Water,” establishing a tensile, smeary, slow-moving accord.) On drums was Pheeroan akLaff, who worked for a time in New Air, after McCall’s death in 1989; on bass was Henry Grimes, one of the surviving frontiersmen of free jazz. Together the group nailed the marchlike cadence and mock-ceremonial intervals of “Salute to the Enema Bandit,” with Mr. Lehman darting crisply through the form. “Midnight Sun” Mr. akLaff, Mr. Lehman and Mr. Jones reappeared in the new Sextett, alongside a second drummer, J. T. Lewis; the trumpeter Graham Haynes; the trombonist Craig Harris; the cellist Christopher Hoffman; and the bassist Linda Oh. “Gateway” laid out a gleeful derangement of military fanfare, one of Mr. Threadgill’s enduring signatures. “Spotted Dick Is Pudding,” with its round robin of soloists over a subtly deceiving chord sequence, suggested a gospel stomp in the shape of a Möbius strip. And while the carnival syncopations of “Black Hands Bejewelled” could have been more precisely played, its festive atmosphere was welcome and convincing. Closing the concert was Harriet Tubman, a downtown power trio comprising Mr. Lewis and the guitarist Brandon Ross — two more Threadgill alumni — along with the bassist Melvin Gibbs. They brought spooky calm to “Unrealistic Love,” a Very Very Circus tune, and some solar-flare intensity to “The Flew,” a piece that courts free improvisation. Then Cassandra Wilson joined the fray, murmuring bittersweet lyrics to “Gone to Far,” a stately art song. She sharpened her attack for
