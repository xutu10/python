E’WAO KAGOSHIMA  Algus Greenspon  71 Morton Street, between Hudson and Greenwich Streets, West Village  Through Nov. 22 If Takashi Murakami had embedded himself in the 1980s East Village art scene, he might have produced something like the sexually charged Pop-Surrealist works on paper of his older countryman E’wao Kagoshima. Mr. Kagoshima is now having something of a resurgence, a well-deserved one, to judge from this sampling of paintings, drawings, dioramas and collages from the 1970s on. Works from 1978, in particular, indicate restless experimentation. Large collage-drawings set monstrous composite figures, who might have been envisioned by Jim Nutt and his Hairy Who cohorts, against decorative abstract backgrounds. Four charcoal drawings made that same year take a surprising Minimalist turn, filling sheets of paper with fields of soft, smoky shading that conjure Vija Celmins or Agnes Martin. Meanwhile, a blue ink drawing of a head in profile, with features that spin off into mollusk-like tails and shells, looks to the 16th-century Italian painter Arcimboldo. Among the more recent works, a set of shadow boxes from 2007-9 stands out. The interiors, lined with Japanese- and English-language newspapers, hold Joseph Cornell-esque assemblages of small found objects: a Barbie-type doll, a plastic octopus, reading glasses. The reverse sides are painted with the faces of beautiful women who may be goddesses, as suggested by the “Venus” title given to several. Multicultural, devotional and deeply eccentric, they suggest that Mr. Kagoshima is still discovering new outlets for his wild imagination.
