Steve Paxton Reprises Dance Works at Dia:Beacon
Steve Paxton’s program of selected works, always open to improvisation, present a striking contrast to the contemporary sculptures inside Dia:Beacon.

BEACON, N.Y. —  At  The museum has housed dance before, notably works by Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown, Mr. Paxton’s contemporaries and former colleagues in the radical experiments of the 1960s and ’70s. But Mr. Paxton, of comparable importance and influence, has been much more committed to the freedoms and strictures of improvisation: different every time, here and gone. So while the four works presented here span nearly 50 years, they are all in some sense new: remade in and of the present. What is reproduced are various shells, the structures once created by Mr. Paxton’s uncommon and ever-molting mind, now reinhabited by him and other dancers. The oldest is “Flat,” from 1964. In this solo, a vintage “What is dance?” work, Mr. Paxton explored the ordinary movements of walking and sitting, focusing attention with freeze-frame poses, some drawn from sports. Dressed in a sober suit, he took it off, hanging the pieces on hooks taped to his skin. The title of the work named its affect. The wit is beyond deadpan, and it was heightened by the staging at Dia:Beacon. Mr. Paxton tripled the solo, having three dancers (K. J. Holmes, Jurij Konjar and Polly Motley) do it at once, each at his or her own pace. The discrepancies emphasized timing and choice, while the dancers’ spacing — at receding distances down a long gallery inhabited by John Chamberlain’s sculptures of crumpled car metal — gave “Flat” depth. The newest piece is “The Beast,” first performed by Mr. Paxton in 2010. It’s an improvisation that restores the amazingness of standing erect. With a profusion of tiny adjustments, internal muscles are made evident through their attachment to extremities, and the body is made to seem as geologically unstable as Florida’s sinkholes. As Mr. Paxton is 75, craggy and granitic next to Mr. Serra’s steel, “The Beast” is inevitably about aging, and in the exposing sunlight of the gallery, it was especially difficult to watch. Discomfort is amusing in the final work, “Smiling” (1967), which has two dancers (Ms. Holmes and Lisa Nelson on Saturday) smile at each other and at us for four minutes next to the bright neon of Dan Flavin. But the surprise of the program is “Bound.” First performed by Mr. Paxton in 1982, “Bound” is, at 50 minutes, three times as long as any of the other selections and distinguished by its reliance on symbolic props, projections, sound scores and music. At Dia:Beacon, those elements, presented in a certain order, are material for an improvisation by Mr. Konjar, who is Slovenian and several decades younger than Mr. Paxton. The work’s clearest symbolism is about middle age, as Mr. Konjar, with a cardboard box around his waist, sits in between a rocking cradle and a rocking chair. The political symbolism is less fixed, although the use of military camouflage and inscrutable radio chatter suggests a soldier damaged by war. The piece feels uncomfortably protracted until music (of all things, the Canadian Brass playing “Napoli”) connects the off-kilter, lost-seeming motion into a wobbly, fascinating dance. I don’t know what it means when Mr. Konjar walks down a kind of zip line made of a string threaded through his swimming cap, but I take it as a metaphorical antithesis of the show as a whole. Mr. Paxton’s mind stimulates a viewer’s in no such linear way.
