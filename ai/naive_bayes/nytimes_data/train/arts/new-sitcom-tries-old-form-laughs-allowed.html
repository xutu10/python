New Sitcom Tries Old Form: Laughs Allowed 
A new show, “Mulaney,” on Fox, goes against the grain for network TV by using the traditional multicamera comedy format, shot on a stage with a studio audience.

It’s hard enough to establish a comedy series in the current climate of network television without disturbing the universe at the same time. Yet here comes John Mulaney, a former “Saturday Night Live” writer and stand-up comedian, wading into one of television’s most entrenched debates, daring to create a sitcom for himself in which people can be heard laughing at the jokes. “I wanted to do this format,” Mr. Mulaney said over coffee this week in Manhattan, his persistent sunniness apparently subduing his inner rebel. “I knew from the get-go we were doing something weird, and we’d come up against resistance.” The format in question is the multicamera comedy, shot on a stage in front of a studio audience. And it’s “something weird” because Across the rest of television, only comedy made the modern way — single-camera shows like “Veep,” shot on film, with no laughter to be heard anywhere — has been acceptable for about a decade. Mr. Mulaney said his friends in comedy told him, ‘I’m so sorry they’re making you do a multicam.’ ” Lorne Michaels, the “S.N.L.” executive producer who is playing the same role on Mr. Mulaney’s show, “Mulaney,” said, “We’re now into that distinction between single-camera shows that are admired and multicamera shows that are watched.” He speaks from the experience of having recently produced a single-camera sitcom created by another former “S.N.L.” writer, Tina Fey: That series, “ Mr. Mulaney has only compounded his risk by creating a show bearing his own name, playing a young comic who writes for a bumptious game show host played by Martin Short. But the lead character lives in a New York apartment; hangs out with a few close friends, including a young woman (Nasim Pedrad) who isn’t his girlfriend; and some neighbors (Elliott Gould plays one) who burst in unannounced. And every episode opens with him doing stand-up in a club. It is hard to imagine a review that won’t note the similarities to “Seinfeld.” That classic comedy may be long out of production, but its reruns remain popular — at least partly because, yes, it followed a multicam format. Over the decades, the multicam comedy has been a better business than the single-camera variety. From “Cheers” to “Frasier,” and “Friends” to “Seinfeld” and “Big Bang,” comedies that have generated the most impact — and profits — have included laughs from studio audiences. The contemporary single-camera comedies, like “30 Rock,” “The Office” and “Parks and Recreation,” have won a great deal of critical love but comparatively few dollars. Even “Modern Family,” by far the best-rated single-camera of recent vintage, has not posted ratings in syndication akin to those of “Big Bang.” So why the decided preference for the single-cam comedy in much of television? One reason is clearly those audible laughs. Especially in new shows like “Mulaney,” the comedy sometimes feels forced and the chuckles artificial. James Burrows, the director whose credits include many of the huge multicamera hits of the past two decades, has been baffled for years about the decline of the multicam format everywhere but CBS. He notes that hearing an audience laugh would not be alien for a play, which, with its living room sets and emphasis on setup-joke banter, is what the multicam sitcom most resembles. “I was raised in the theater,” Mr. Burrows said. (His father was Abe Burrows, co-author of the book for “Guys and Dolls.”) “When you do single-cam, you are the sole judge of what’s funny. With multicam, you can continue to work on the jokes, because the audience lets you know what’s working.” The longer runs of multicam shows are no surprise, he said, “because the others are so niche — I call them precious.” Mr. Michaels said multicam comedies feel less contemporary. But when viewers see a traditional multicamera show, “everybody knows what it is,” he said. “There’s something comforting about hearing laughter,” he continued. “And it’s an American form.” But it has become only a CBS form. Other networks have tried multicams in recent years — like “ Mr. Michaels joked: “There are two people who believe in this form: One is Les Moonves, and the other is John Mulaney.” He added: “It once was mainstream, now it’s sort of fringe. It looks in a certain way like a bold choice.” Or a foolish one. Early reactions to “Mulaney” have ranged from mixed to ferociously negative. Tim Goodman, a TV critic for The Hollywood Reporter, wrote, “There is no saving a show  Mr. Mulaney responded: “I don’t mind hearing it. But I think it’s an interesting, intelligent show. I understand things seeming audibly out of touch, with people not having heard live audience laughter in a long while.” But he added: “I know it’s not heinous. If people don’t like the show, I can’t do anything for you.” Mr. Michaels said that television comedy usually needed a season to find its voice, citing examples that started with low ratings and some derision, only to wind up sustaining their networks. (The comparison again: “Seinfeld.”) “There will be growing pains,” Mr. Michaels said, after seeing the 12 episodes of “Mulaney” that have been produced. “The more recent episodes are way better, head and shoulders over when we began. But the cast is good, and John is enormously likable.” Whatever happens, Mr. Mulaney is content with his choice. “I wanted to try a pure comedy and see if you can have a big tent with what we do, with this style of comedy,” he said. “It might be an empty big tent for a while. But I’m getting the chance to put it up.”
