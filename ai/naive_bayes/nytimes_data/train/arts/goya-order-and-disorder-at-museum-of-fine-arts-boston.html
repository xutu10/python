‘Goya: Order and Disorder’ at Museum of Fine Arts, Boston
“Goya: Order and Disorder,” at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, offers the broadest view of this artist’s career in America in more than two decades.

BOSTON —  The snapshots of savagery that the news media withholds — of mass murder, torture and rape in progress — Francisco Goya placed front and center in his art. In the print series known as “The Disasters of War,” he is a virtuoso of violence: shading it, savoring it, prodding it toward us with blunt intent. He wants to make us feel sick at being the species we are. If these prints and even more harrowing images from his private albums of drawings were the entire contents of “Goya: Order and Disorder” at the  To experience Goya the monumental painter, you go to the Prado. What Boston has is exceptionally fine holdings in his works on paper, which formed the bulk of his output, served as a laboratory for experimentation and functioned as an emotional safety valve. Using this material as a base, the museum has assembled an impressive array of paintings and drawings from other collections, including the Prado’s, and arranged some 170 worked by theme rather than by date. A thematic approach can be a tricky, Procrustean way to go; you’re basically imposing an artificially neatening template on an unruly career. But the curators here, Frederick Ilchman and Stephanie Loeb Stepanek, have brought it off, giving what they refer to as a “reshuffled retrospective” visual density and a manic mood that catches the pulse of Goya’s irritated character and his time. He was born near Zaragoza, in the Aragon region of Spain, in 1746, trained as a painter there and was working in Madrid by the age of 17, though his was no overnight success. He twice entered a Royal Academy talent competition in hopes of winning a trip to Italy and was rejected. He finally paid his own way and lost a competition in Italy, too. His entry in that contest, a painting called “Hannibal the Conqueror Viewing Italy for the First Time From the Alps,” is in the show, done in a confectionary neo-Classical style he would soon leave behind. Back in Madrid, he married the sister of an artist he had worked under. They had seven children, only one of whom, Javier, lived to adulthood. He applied for a position as a court painter, but was turned down. So for years, he held onto and chafed at what he considered a dead-end job as a designer in the Royal Tapestry Factory, and took on church mural commissions, one of which ended abruptly when he quarreled with his brother-in-law who was in charge of the project. Goya must have been a handful to live with. Smart, mercurial, self-promoting: It’s all there in self-portraits that open the show. In a bust-length drawing from around 1785, he’s a natty striver in a three-corner hat. A decade later, we see him wearing a short, tight matador’s jacket — street-punk attire — and a kooky hat with lighted candles on the brim. Then, in another shift, he casts himself as an actor in a symbolic drama, the nodded-out figure hallucinating hellish bats and owls in the etching called “The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters.” By the time he made this print, between 1797 and 1799, there had been huge changes in his life. A grave illness had left him permanently deaf and, in some fundamental way, withdrawn, watchful and soured on the world. At the same time, he was finally realizing many of his professional goals. He had been appointed painter to the king and the society portraitist everyone wanted to hire. One of the exhibition’s highlights is a long, salonlike room lined with Goya’s likenesses of aristocratic clients and just plain friends. The duchess of Alba was both, and New Yorkers will instantly recognize her imperative presence in a painting owned by the Hispanic Society of America. Although recently widowed — a portrait of her dashing husband hangs nearby — she is entirely in command of her emotions, and of everyone else’s it would seem, including the artist’s. But the gallery, with its population of elegant, at-ease peers, is the calm at the eye of a storm, its atmosphere of good-natured decorum found nowhere else. A full-length figure painting, dated 1810, in an adjoining gallery, sounds a very different note. Its image of two crones, desiccated and syphilitic, dressed in court attire is a scathing caricature of the aristocratic model that helped make Goya’s name, and a vision of blind, brutalizing vanity that for him was, more and more, the human story. That narrative was played out in the politics of the time. In 1808, a French army under Napoleon invaded Spain, deposed its king and put another ruler, Napoleon’s brother, Joseph Bonaparte, in his place. The French brought reforms: They shut down the Inquisition and broke the economic stranglehold of the Roman Catholic church. At the same time, they inflicted catastrophic levels of destruction and violence on local populations. As an Enlightenment-bred liberal, Goya might have been expected to welcome the reforms, and as a patriot, to condemn the aggression. In a sense, he did both. His “Disasters of War” is an unreserved indictment of French crimes against humanity; but his prints and drawings of torture under the Spanish Inquisition are no less chilling. That the scenes depicted in both cases were imagined rather than reported from life does nothing to lessen their impact. To further complicate matters, Goya the moralist and Goya the pragmatist were in uneasy sync. As a professional artist, he served, with equal care and attention, whoever was on the throne: Spanish, French, conservative, liberal. He then picked up his paycheck and went home to process outraged resistance in drawings, prints and paintings that he kept to himself. The exhibition, by mixing together art of different kinds and from different periods in Goya’s life, suggests an abiding condition of moral ambivalence and conflict that is probably close to accurate. He does paintings for churches at the same time that he draws notebook cartoons of a corrupt and greedy clergy. He invites our moral revulsion at the sight of men and women being slaughtered like beasts, but depicts animals being tormented and butchered in hunts and bullfights with a sportsman’s relish. All in all, the primary ethos projected by the show is moral ambiguity, which translates into chaos. Time and again, we sense the artist bumping up against the limits of humanism, and sounding the unplumbed depths of the subconscious. As if to give us, and Goya, some comfort, the curators place two late devotional images near the end of the show. One is an altarpiece depicting the serene, sanctified death of St. Joseph Calasanz, like Goya a native of Aragon. The other is a self-portrait in which the artist presents himself, doleful and weak, resting in the arms of a doctor who had pulled him through another illness and given him what turned out to be eight more years of life. This is an angelic scene, almost enough to persuade us that our species is redeemable after all. But there’s still a bit more story to go. In 1824, having pretty much burned his political bridges, Goya went into retirement — exile, really — in France, settling in Bordeaux. Before he left, he made a masterpiece of aquatint print called  In Bordeaux, Goya did some more portraits and bullfight prints and, possibly right before his death in 1828, a funny little charcoal sketch. It’s an image of a bunch of grimacing people — all we see are heads — crammed into a hole in the ground shaped like the heel of a giant shoe, with smoke, maybe flames coming out. The figures already look half-crushed. It’s clear they can’t get out. If the heel comes down again, they’re done for. Goya titled the piece — it’s written on the sheet — “Comical Discovery.” Go figure.
