Shamel Pitts on a Dancer’s Life in Israel
Shamel Pitts, a New York-born Juilliard graduate, talks about what it’s like to live in Tel Aviv as part of the Batsheva Dance Company.

Whether onstage or on the streets of Tel Aviv, Shamel Pitts commands attention. When performing with the Batsheva Dance Company, Israel’s premier contemporary dance troupe, he projects magnetic focus and pounces with ferocious abandon. When strolling down Rothschild Boulevard in the center of town, often with oversize glasses, flowing graphic shirts, nudged-off-center hats and a cool stride, he makes you turn and think, “There goes a personality.” Mr. Pitts joined Batsheva in 2009, two years after graduating from Juilliard. When the company lands at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Nov. 12 to 15, it will be a homecoming for this Brooklyn native. “I’m hyped about it,” he said in a Skype interview from his apartment in Tel Aviv. “It will be special to bring my life in Israel to my family and friends in Brooklyn.” In addition to his presence in the concert hall, Mr. Pitts has become a Tel Aviv night life fixture as well, starting a fashion magazine and hosting monthly parties with local collaborators. He’s inspired by Tel Aviv’s openness and creativity, which he likens to his hometown. He sees in both places “a shared sense of realness.” Ahead of the company’s monthlong 50th anniversary tour of the United States, which began its California leg this week, Mr. Pitts chatted with Brian Schaefer about finding himself in Israel and dancing under the threat of rocket fire. These are excerpts from the conversation. Q. How have you settled in after moving to Tel Aviv? A. You’ve become quite a presence in Tel Aviv’s celebrated night life scene. What drew you to that? I grew up with my mother having parties all the time. I was always up late with adults, dancing. Because I’m a performer, I wanted to do stuff in night life that brought more color and another level of art and culture. I’m interested in stuff that relates to my culture in New York, the African-American underground gay community. I started a fashion magazine with Billy Barry, another dancer from Batsheva, called Fagazine, and I do monthly parties where we put a white line down people’s forehead, so they become a tribe. It’s our signature branding. How did the war in Gaza this summer affect you personally and as a performer? I would wake up at 6 a.m. to the sirens. I would freak out, jump out of bed naked, grab my sheets and go into the bomb shelter. It happened for weeks, and it never became normal. One thing that I’ve learned from living here was how to live in the moment. As a performer, it was scary to know the potential of a siren going off during the show. It was very unsettling and nerve-racking. So before the shows, I would take time to create a state of mind that was clear, conscious and focused. What happened if a siren went off during a performance? We’d be ushered to one shelter, and the audience to another. After 15 minutes, our co-manager would say: “Get ready. We’ll continue with the show.” I felt happy to continue. It felt necessary. But it was very extreme. Protesters opposed to Israeli policies sometimes appear at Batsheva performances. How does that feel for a performer, and non-Israeli? As performers, it charges us in a way that gives us fire to dance. It gives us more passion and belief in what we’re doing. When the boycotts happen, outside the theater, I go out to watch and listen, if I can. I want to see what people are saying and feeling. Anything that starts conversation, I’m into it. When they come into the theater and stop the show, it crosses a line. Then it’s not a boycott, it’s opposing who we are as artists and humanitarians. I’m from Brooklyn, and I’m here to do my art.
