Maurizio Pollini at Carnegie Hall
In a Carnegie Hall concert, Maurizio Pollini’s programming choices showed a change in emphasis and message.

Doubt, the theologian Paul Tillich wrote, is an “element of faith.” After Maurizio Pollini’s  Mr. Pollini’s recent New York concerts have played the repertoire uncharacteristically straight. Gone are the  But Mr. Pollini’s pianism has never relied solely on the cold, calculating accuracy that his detractors seem only to hear. A technique now weakened, the argument might run, must mean less can be said. Not less, in fact, but something different. With a little forbearance for slips — very little, in truth — this recital confirmed that he was pushing further and harder than ever before. Take Schumann’s “Kreisleriana,” blurred yet vital in its details like a late Turner canvas, full of harmonic yearning in the second section, as darkly knotty as Liszt’s atonal flirtations in the fourth, rashly dismissive of an attempt at formal coherence in the eighth part’s fugue. Here and in the “Arabeske,” Mr. Pollini proved unusually ruminative, a reminder that “your old men shall dream dreams.” At his preferred Steinway, refined by Angelo Fabbrini, Mr. Pollini encircled even the angriest of his Chopin in a halo. Is it possible that his Chopin is becoming still stronger? It sounded so. He rendered the Second Sonata with a touch at one moment feathery, the next like graphite, its first movement structured as if it were Haydn, its impressionistic last looking beyond Debussy to electronic haze. The funeral march journeyed from distant desperation through a serenity too perfect to last, inevitably if cruelly destroyed with renewed steel. Darkness lifted for a Berceuse sung with fragility, and for a dignified Opus 53 Polonaise. The Opus 45 Prelude, long a Pollini favorite, wandered restlessly, free only because of total harmonic control. And four encores made almost for another concert: a shimmering Nocturne (Op. 27, No. 2), a roguish third Scherzo, a “Revolutionary” Étude (Op. 10, No. 12) raging to keep the fires burning, and, finally, a noble first Ballade. Each found Mr. Pollini at his greatest, and more.
