Metropolitan Opera’s Deficit Swells to $22 Million
The company faces its most serious shortfall in decades, but says a new business model and endowment drive will put it on better footing.

The Metropolitan Opera’s deficit ballooned to an estimated $22 million last year, the company said Thursday, as weaker-than-expected contributions and ticket sales combined with expenses related to the company’s labor talks to create its most serious shortfall in decades. It is hardly a secret that the Met has been having financial troubles — that is why the company sought, and ultimately won,  The deficit for the 2013-14 season was roughly eight times that of the previous season. Calculated as a percentage of the budget, it was the Met’s biggest deficit since 1984. The 2013-14 season shortfall amounted to nearly 7 percent of its overall budget of roughly $316 million, according to preliminary financial data; the 1984 deficit was about 10 percent of the budget. “The looming operating deficit for last season was a warning call,” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said in a statement. “It’s what compelled us to seek concessions in the union negotiations. Looking ahead, by adopting a leaner, streamlined business model in combination with a larger endowment, we will place the company on safer financial footing.” Things are looking brighter this year: In addition to cutting expenses, the Met said that its box-office revenues are already $2 million higher than they were at this point last season, and that donations are expected to increase now that its labor dispute had been settled. The Met began reducing its expenses last year — its budget fell to $316 million from $327 million the year before — but the falloff in contributions and underperformance at the box office in that period meant that revenues still fell short of expenses. Its contentious labor talks, which at one point threatened to delay or cancel the current season with a lockout, imposed costs of their own. A number of one-time expenses related to those talks added roughly $4 million to last year’s spending, Met officials estimated. Those ranged from legal fees, to the severance pay given to the unusually large number of employees who retired, to unexpectedly high medical costs, some of which may have been incurred by people seeking care before any lockout threatened their coverage. The Met expects the labor and management cuts it agreed to this summer to save it $18.5 million in the current fiscal year and $22 million when they are fully phased in the following year, which it projects will balance its budgets. The company’s unions agreed to their first pay cuts in decades; management eliminated 22 positions, mostly through layoffs; some of the company’s biggest stars agreed to voluntarily cut their fees; fees to vendors and consultants have been reduced by 7 percent; and the Met is working to save money this season by scheduling rehearsals to involve less overtime pay and by trimming the number of people required for some operas. The Met is also preparing for a campaign to double its endowment, which was valued at $265 million at the end of July.
