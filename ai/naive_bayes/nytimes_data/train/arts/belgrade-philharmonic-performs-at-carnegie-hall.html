You can only imagine how much it meant to the  But for the last 10 years, the 96-member orchestra has been steadily rising and winning support at home. One goal of the tour, which included stops in Chicago, Cleveland and North Bethesda, Md., was to raise money, especially from Americans of Serbian heritage, for the construction of a new concert hall.

Mr. Tang began by conducting first the American and then the Serbian national anthem. For such an important concert, the program was unadventurous. It opened with Tchaikovsky’s “Marche Slave,” the popular 10-minute tone poem.
