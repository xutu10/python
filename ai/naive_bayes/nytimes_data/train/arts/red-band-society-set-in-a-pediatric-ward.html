‘Red Band Society,’ Set in a Pediatric Ward
The new Fox drama series “Red Band Society” follows a group of teenagers whose common bond is hospital treatments for serious diseases.

There are so few obstacles left for middle-class teenagers to struggle against. Parents and teachers are permissive, bullying is stomped upon, acne can be treated, and only the most exacting religions discourage gay or interfaith relationships. So that leaves cancer. “ It’s a depressing setting, of course, but the show tries to inject humor and arch self-awareness right away. The narrator is in a coma. “You can hear everything; you just can’t respond,” 12-year-old Charlie (Griffin Gluck) says. “Everyone knows how hard it is to make friends. Imagine how hard it is to make friends in a coma.” “Red Band Society” gathers some of the most familiar archetypes of high school — the mean-girl cheerleader; the jock; the neurasthenic, usually goth, poet — and dashes their boat against the shoals of fatal illness. In its way, teenagers on IVs are as fresh a path into rite-of-passage clichés as a cappella singers were for “Glee” when that show began on Fox in 2009. Evidently, it’s hard to come up with anything new: The video of “Fancy,” the hit song of the summer, was a pastiche of the 1995 movie “Clueless.” It’s hard to think of anything sadder or more manipulative than portrayals of a dying child. Books and movies are full of them — from Dickens’s Little Nell and Beth March of “Little Women” all the way to the heroines of this past summer, when the movie season was bracketed by two similar dramas based on young adult novels, “ Doomed teenagers are romantic figures, but sickly ones also present older viewers with a younger generation they can relate to. These heroes have all the youth, beauty and computer-coding ability of the young, but with an added sense of mortality and limitation. Most of all, of course, it’s poignant. And like those summer movies, “Red Band Society” has a tone that is both sassy and sorrowful, a carefully calculated balance of humor and sentiment. The pilot episode, however, leans too heavily on emotional tugs. The main hospital staff members are all caring, comforting and competent. Even the imperious Nurse Jackson (Octavia Spencer), a woman so sharp-tongued her nom de caffè on a Starbucks cup is Scary Bitch, is kindhearted. Parents are mostly unseen in the premiere, but there’s a loony ex-hippie hypochondriac, played by  That would seem like the most preposterous premise in the show had it not been for the recent revelations about  It could be that hospital administrators and perhaps even parents on “Red Band Society” will surface later as hostile creatures, and that would be welcome because in the first episode, at least, the teenagers, who are appealing, very quickly crack through one another’s facades and initial enmities soon dissolve. Even Kara (Zoe Levin), the mean-girl cheerleader, is tamed before episode’s end. She begins promisingly as a spoiled, willful beauty who bullies everyone. The opening scene is one of the best: When she falls during practice and lies sprawled unconscious on the floor, her teammates surround her in a circle of clicking smartphones, as intense and rapid-fire as pool photographers at a White House photo op. “Shouldn’t we call 911?” a student says. A friend replies, “Not until I post this on Instagram.” Kara awakens unrepentant at the hospital, puffs smoke into the face of Charlie, whom she calls Coma Boy, and orders the nurses around like maids. She sweetly tells Emma (Ciara Bravo), who is fighting an eating disorder, “I have cigarettes and diet pills if you get hungry.” Leo (Charlie Rowe), who has cancer and has been at the hospital the longest, is reluctant to befriend yet another new patient with a questionable chance of survival. But he warms up to Jordi (Nolan Sotillo), who left Mexico by himself to seek treatment and talked his way into the surgery ward. Emma is friendlier to Jordi but cool to Leo; the two share a “Much Ado About Nothing” frenmity. Dash (Astro), the rule breaker, is most interested in talking a new and inexperienced nurse into giving him a sponge bath. It’s an appealing cast in a disturbing setting. Coming-of-age themes are eternal, but on “Red Band Society” young people on the precipice of love and angst can’t be certain they will live long enough to feel it.
