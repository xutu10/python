The mission of the starship at the center of the latest  The four-episode series is “Starship Icarus,” and it’s must viewing for anyone whose head is filled with memory fragments of “Star Wars,” “Star Trek,” “Lost in Space” and so on, which of course is practically everyone. This collective body of intergalactic references has already been mined for humor — the films  The five flunkies who are the focus of the series don’t battle hostile extraterrestrials, though there seem to be plenty of them around in whatever universe this ship is flying through. They maintain the computers and more mundane systems that keep the ship going, which is a formidable job because, as Episode 1 explained, the ship has a mind of its own and when it gets nervous it tends to spew raw sewage onto certain decks. But the series isn’t all or even primarily bathroom humor. It eventually works its way around to the kinds of metaphysical questions that made “Star Trek” so great.

In space, no one can hear you wink.
