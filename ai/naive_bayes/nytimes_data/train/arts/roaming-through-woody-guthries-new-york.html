Roaming Through Woody Guthrie’s New York
Woody Guthrie Publications is releasing “My Name Is New York,” a three-CD audiobook with a walking guide and interviews and songs about the city where he lived for 27 years.

YOU say you want to have a close encounter with  Then you’d better get a MetroCard, because the heart of his story lies within the confines of New York City, Woody’s home for 27 of his 55 years, along a path you can roam and ramble in about a day. Blame that big wide-open song “This Land Is Your Land,” but many of us have been myth-led into thinking of Woody Guthrie only in windswept Western spaces: the Dust Bowl, the Oklahoma hills where he was born, the Depression-era labor camps of California, the Columbia River Gorge, with its mighty dams. But this transplanted Okie from Okemah made his name in the beehive of mid-Manhattan and Greenwich Village, cross-pollinating with other musicians, actors, scholars, dancers, writers and artists. He rode the rails of the BMT. He played (unhappily, but still) for the swells at the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center. He married a Martha Graham dancer named Marjorie. He had Yiddish-speaking in-laws, the Greenblatts. He settled — to the extent he settled anywhere — in the tract-house expanses of Brooklyn and Queens. He traded the Dust Bowl for the sandbox of Coney Island, where he spent some of his happiest days, playing on the beach with his children. To reconnect the artist and his city, Woody Guthrie Publications, the company run by his daughter Nora Guthrie, is issuing an audio walking guide with three CDs of interviews with people who lived and worked with him and songs he wrote in and about the city. Out next week, it’s called  I’m the town called New York, I was struck by the winds; I been froze and been blistered And then struck again; I was struck by my rich folks, And struck by my bums Struck by my mansions, And struck by my slums. The accompanying paperback (published by itself in 2012) is sized for a back pocket and packed with archival photos and street addresses. When it came in the mail, I contacted Woody’s grandchildren Anna Canoni and Cole Rotante, who never knew their grandfather but are fluent in Woody lore. They set aside a Sunday for a tour. Cole writes software and plays dobro in a  She met me in the morning at Grand Central Terminal. We were joined later by Cole, who had just flown on the red-eye from California — from the redwood forest, actually. Cole has the frizzy hair of his Uncle Arlo and shares with his sister a recognizably Woodyish sense of humor: wry and relaxed, just this side of goofy. Their banter made them ideal guides for a long day’s journey into a historic, often very sad, family story. The first stop: 1940. One blizzardy February day that year, with the bridges closed from snow and ice, Woody walked into Manhattan after hitchhiking from California. He crashed for a few days on the couch at the apartment of his friend the actor Will Geer. The building, at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, is gone: It’s an Apple Store now. Anna next took me to Avenue of the Americas and 43rd Street, where Woody had the first New York room of his own. Then it was a low-rent rooming house; now it’s an office tower housing the International Center of Photography, where a photo mural in the window shows the actual street-level storefronts of the ’40s, including the tuxedo shop Woody lived above. Here, within sight of the Empire State Building, he wrote “This Land Is Your Land.” (In a public vote this summer to name the Smithsonian’s “most iconic item,” the song was edged out only by Bao Bao the panda and the original Star-Spangled Banner; it beat a portrait of George Washington.) Woody’s handwritten draft, reproduced in the book, shows a startling revision: He first wrote “from California to the Staten Island,” then crossed out “Staten” and made it “New York,” probably forever ruining that borough’s best path out of obscurity. Anna and I elbowed through Times Square and its Elmo-costumed panhandlers to 49th Street and the Eugene O’Neill Theater, site of Woody’s first New York performance, at a “Grapes of Wrath” benefit concert for Dust Bowl victims. The audience thrilled to hear a real live singing Okie, which was sort of accurate. Woody’s father had been in real estate, not farming, though he was broken by the Depression all the same. That 1940 concert drew Woody into a creative constellation that included the scholar Alan Lomax and the musicians Josh White, Burl Ives and, then unknown, Pete Seeger and Huddie Ledbetter, known as Lead Belly. The members of this restless circle of free radicals have long since been mythologized as pioneers in artistic activism, living in lofts and uplifting the working poor through song. But back then, they were still figuring it out, moving all over the city, making tons of music but often barely making rent. “It reminds me so much of Paris in the ’20s, it’s an American version of that,” Nora told me by phone, noting how so many of Woody’s comrades lived within blocks of one another, or lived communally, an arrangement favored by the Almanac Singers, the precursor to the Weavers and other folk groups that included Pete and Woody, until Woody went his own way. In the West Village, on Charles Street, we stopped in front of a red stucco-clad building obscured by the triple New York curse of scaffolding, construction Dumpster and portable toilet. It was Woody’s 11th apartment in three years, Anna said, but notable for being the first where he alone signed the lease, in 1942. Woody and Marjorie, newly together though still married to other people, made it a little lovers’ hideaway they called El Rancho del Sol. We headed over to West 10th Street, where Woody lived with the Almanac Singers in 1941. The basement was where they had their hootenannies, singing songs for hard times and hammering Hitler. Now it’s a veterinary clinic. We would have walked from there to a Woody hangout, McSorley’s pub, but we had two more boroughs to get to, and so after lunch, joined by Cole, we took the train to Queens. There, we picked up my car and drove to the Jamaica Bay Riding Academy, where we hoped to hire horses for a trail ride to the beach — something Woody used to do — but it was too late in the day. So it was on to Howard Beach — down Cross Bay Boulevard to 85th Street — to the Cape Cod house where Marjorie raised Arlo, Nora and Joady, from 1952 to 1967. Woody, dying slowly of Huntington’s disease, was hospitalized that whole time, though he did come home most weekends. This was not then or ever a trendy neighborhood — it’s a block from where the mob boss John Gotti lived — though the Guthrie house has seen extensive renovations, with elaborate stonework, landscaping, bay windows and fluted columns. The only residents to greet us were two Pekingese yapping from a side walkway. This is the house where Bob Dylan appeared one weekday afternoon in January 1961, looking for Woody. The babysitter sent him away. Nora was watching “American Bandstand” and did not want to be bothered. But Arlo saw his guitar and let him in, and they played together while waiting for Marjorie to come home. Bob stayed for dinner and then — the course of history having been altered — Marjorie drove him to the Euclid Avenue subway station for the ride back to the city. He was the first of a stream of young Woody wannabes in the ’60s. Arlo, in the audiobook, remembered it this way: “These young people started visiting us, coming to the door, and the neighbors would look out and see these people with work boots and baggy pants and shaggy hair and guitars strung over their back, and they would say: ‘There goes another weird one. They’re visiting the Guthries.’ ” On Arlo’s recommendation, we went around the corner to New Park Pizza, a Guthrie family favorite that you may remember from the Howard Beach riots of 1986. He was right about the slices. There are a bunch of places we missed. We didn’t go to Woody’s three hospitals — including Creedmoor in Queens, where he died — figuring we could skip this story’s big, bleak institutional chapters. If we had had extra time, we might have gone to the Hotel New Yorker, back in Manhattan on Eighth Avenue, where the Almanac Singers performed in a union benefit concert and had crockery thrown at them, because the audience didn’t like their shabby-looking proletarian outfits (only Lead Belly saw no need to affect a working-class style and always wore a starched shirt and tie); or Washington Square Park, where Ramblin’ Jack Elliott played by the fountain with a scruffy-bearded Woody, looking uncannily like the classic Brooklyn hipster of 50 years hence. All roads on the Woody trail lead to the ocean in Brooklyn, where we ended the day. Woody and Marjorie lived a while in Sea Gate, an exclusive community not because it’s wealthy — it’s as dumpy as the blocks around it and was battered as badly by Hurricane Sandy — but because its residents have locked themselves in behind razor wire and gates manned by guards with N.Y.P.D.-style uniforms and Pinkerton attitudes. Seeing our little unauthorized car, a guard told us to back up and leave. “Woody Guthrie lived here,” I said, hopefully. “So did Al Capone,” he said. “Back up.” So we migrated to the Guthries’ best-known Coney Island address, 3520 Mermaid Avenue — Billy Bragg and Wilco recorded three acclaimed “Mermaid Avenue” albums using Woody lyrics given to them by Nora. The old building is gone, and the new one is now apartments for the elderly. But a laminated sheet on a sidewalk signpost notes the Woody connection. Here the couple lived in a one-bedroom apartment near Marjorie’s parents. It was a short walk to the beach, where Woody often took the kids, dripping wet gray sand into free-form hoodoo-shaped castles. Those were a happy seven years, Marjorie says on the CD, where his output peaked in a flood of essays, poems, drawings and songs, including “Riding in My Car” and an unpublished song with these lines: Blintzes and cheeses Knishes and spam Go Coney Island Roll on the sand Anna, Cole and I walked to the Boardwalk and onto the broad stretch of sand beside the 37th Street jetty, at the western end of Coney Island. The setting sun threw beams through the clouds onto New York Harbor. Anna told me this was where Marjorie used to go when her husband shipped out with the merchant marine. The ships would steam out of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and pass the horizon in a long line. This is where Marjorie, Nora, Joady and Arlo brought Woody’s ashes, in October 1967. Woody’s last rites were ad hoc. Marjorie wanted to scatter him on the water but the church-key holes she had made in the canister were too small. They tossed the canister off the jetty (all but submerged now), but it came floating back on the tide. After several failed tries, Arlo finally heaved the can as far as he could and it sank out of sight. They weren’t sure what to do next. Marjorie suggested going to Nathan’s for hot dogs and root beer and what Woody had called “hot patooties.” That’s what we did, too, Anna and Cole and I, but not before they took a trip on the Wonder Wheel, a Guthrie family tradition, circling high into the dark over the glowing lights of Woody’s world. Later I drove them to the subway and we parted ways: Anna to Grand Central, and Cole to his apartment to pick up his dobro; he had a gig.
