Anita Rachvelishvili in Richard Eyre’s ‘Carmen’ at the Met
Anita Rachvelishvili is a grim and no-nonsense Carmen in the revival of Richard Eyre’s melancholy production of Bizet’s opera at the Met.
===
Near the end of Bizet’s “Carmen,” minutes before the title character is brutally murdered by her former lover, Don José, her friends tell her to watch out: José is nearby. “I am not the kind of woman to tremble before him,” she retorts. But what kind of woman The Georgian mezzo-soprano  Mr. Eyre’s show offers brooding and sternness more than sensuality or high spirits. With Carmen’s trudging endlessly forward and José’s looking shellshocked and vacant eyed, operagoers could be forgiven for thinking they had accidentally wandered into a performance of Berg’s “Wozzeck.” That’s not necessarily a criticism. Watching Ms. Rachvelishvili stare stonily at the tenor Aleksandrs Antonenko, as Don José, I was aware as never before of the opera’s conceit that these characters have been thrown together, mostly miserably, by fate. They love each other without ever much liking each other. The trouble with this revival is: If you don’t feel that electric tug of destiny uniting Carmen and José, the opera — especially given Rob Howell’s stark sets — can feel more dingy and plodding than potent. Without dark chemistry coursing between the two, it’s hard to care about their struggle. Part of the problem is Pablo Heras-Casado’s lithe, agile, expansive, even leisurely conducting, fine on its own merits but not a proper match for this severe production. When this “Carmen” was new, it was led by Yannick Nézet-Séguin, whose take on the score was occasionally propulsive to a fault, but with a blunt, savage energy that better suited, and heated, the mood. Though Tuesday’s performance never really ignited, the conditions were certainly right for some fire: four youthful, powerful voices in the leading roles. Anita Hartig, as Micaëla, has a strongly vibrating, dark-toned soprano with character, if also a tendency to turn sharp under pressure. The baritone Massimo Cavalletti sang the toreador Escamillo smoothly and evenly; while not ideally suave, he had casual charm. Early in the performance, Mr. Antonenko tended to sing each line, however intimate, like he was summoning an army into battle, which made for thrilling, ringing high notes and a relentless quality elsewhere. But his nuances increased as the evening went on. If Ms. Rachvelishvili’s blooming voice loses some texture and presence in its middle range, it blazes when she leans on it at the top and bottom. And her defiantly gloomy portrayal had a daring disregard for the insouciant smile flashing of many takes on the role. Her Carmen was more interesting than this “Carmen.”
