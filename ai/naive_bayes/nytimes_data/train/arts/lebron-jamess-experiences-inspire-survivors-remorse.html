LeBron James’s Experiences Inspire ‘Survivor’s Remorse’
The Starz comedy “Survivor’s Remorse,” about challenges facing a newly successful basketball player, is loosely based on the lives of LeBron James and his manager.

ATLANTA —  The title of “Survivor’s Remorse,” Starz’s new six-episode comedy series about a fictional professional basketball player who has just signed his first multimillion-dollar contract, came from Maverick Carter, who is the manager and a childhood friend of the newly returned Cleveland Cavalier LeBron James, the most famous basketball player in the world. It is a phrase they had used often to describe their conflicting emotions about their enormous success, a life of private jets and manicured estates beyond anything they could have imagined when they were growing up in their poor and often dangerous Akron, Ohio, neighborhood. The phrase came up when Mr. Carter was talking to Tom Werner, the chairman of the Boston Red Sox and a producer of numerous sitcom hits (including “Roseanne” and “The Cosby Show”) about opportunities for Mr. James in the television business. Mr. Werner wanted something like the  “LeBron always wanted the commercial to be as close to his real life as possible,” Mr. Carter said. “And it was. But we weren’t going to make a show about LeBron’s life. That was never on the table.” In wide-ranging conversations over the course of months, Mr. Carter, 33, came back to the idea of “Survivor’s Remorse.” He recalled: “I don’t know if we were even talking about it as a show. I explained to Tom how I have it sometimes, because of my family and my neighborhood where I come from. There’s a lot of good people there, and not all of them, to use a phrase, make it out. And I did. But a lot of times I feel bad about making it when they didn’t. I have survivor’s remorse.” Mr. Werner suggested, in spite of the title, that the show should be a comedy, adult in tone and often dealing with serious topics and difficult emotions, but a comedy nonetheless. “In some ways, comedy is an easier platform to talk about serious issues than drama,” Mr. Werner said as he watched a scene being filmed here at a home in the upscale Atlanta neighborhood Buckhead. “We can talk about race and privilege and culture, but in a smart, clever funny way.” He brought in Mike O’Malley, whose script credits include “Shameless” but who may be better known for his acting roles in “Glee” and “Yes, Dear,” to write and serve as show runner. The series he created, which begins next Saturday, revolves around Cam Calloway (played by Jessie T. Usher), an underrated point guard who, after playing for the league minimum in Memphis, has a breakout season, signs a big-money contract with Atlanta and, just like that, finds himself surrounded by the trappings and temptations that come with sports stardom. How he — and his family — deal with that sudden wealth and fame is what “Survivor’s Remorse” is about. “Cam is someone who’s generous at heart and feels guilty about having all this money when he knows so many who are still struggling,” said Mr. O’Malley, who took elements of Mr. Carter’s and Mr. James’s experiences, but created fictional circumstances and characters to illustrate them. Cam, for instance, is from Dorchester, the Boston neighborhood, and his manager-confidant-best friend is his cousin Reggie (played by RonReaco Lee). “I will not let you be a cautionary tale,” Reggie tells his cousin in the pilot, trying to explain that no matter how much money he has, he can’t save everyone who asks for help. “Some tweaker does not deserve a place on your generosity list just because he grew up two doors down.” Many of the story lines will seem familiar to anyone who’s watched “SportsCenter” or followed the N.B.A. (The new show, unable to secure permission from the league, never mentions it or specific franchises by name and never shows any footage from games, real or fictional.) There are dubious characters from Cam’s past who show up at inopportune moments, conflicts about endorsement deals and — in an episode filmed long before the football star Adrian Peterson’s child-discipline controversy — a media uproar after Cam’s mother proudly talks about how she used to “whup him with a Hot Wheels track” when he was a little boy. Although there are some parallels to the now-canceled HBO series “Entourage” — both share the premise of a young star and his neighborhood pals dealing with a glamorous but sometimes treacherous new way of life — the difference is that Cam Calloway’s entourage is family: his mother; his cousin; his truth-telling Uncle Julius (played by Mike Epps); and his lesbian sister, M-Chuck (played by Erica Ash). Mr. O’Malley and everyone associated with the show make a point of emphasizing that “Survivor’s Remorse” is not about Mr. James, that the characters and situations are fictional and that beyond reading a few scripts, Mr. James, although listed as an executive producer, had no direct input into story lines. In an email interview, Mr. James said the show came together during basketball season, so his time was limited. “Most important for me was the opportunity to empower my organization to have an impact,” he said. “The show created over 200 jobs for people. We need more television shows for great black actors.” Mr. James also said it didn’t matter to him whether “Survivor’s Remorse” was about basketball per se. “It’s not a show to help people understand the life of an athlete,” he said, and added, referring to the ESPN documentary series: “They can go to ‘30 for 30’ or places like that for a serious story.” Even though Cam Calloway is clearly not LeBron James, there will inevitably be speculation as to which plot points — and characters — might be based on actual incidents. In Mr. Carter’s view, “people are sophisticated enough to know that these are fictional characters,” he said. “We want it to be entertaining and funny and to feel real. But it’s not about us.” Even so, Mr. O’Malley said Mr. Carter was a regular, and welcome, presence on the set, offering observations and suggestions on matters like which poses would be used in a shoe endorsement photo and which video games players prefer. “Maverick has been parsing this thing within an inch of its life,” Mr. O’Malley said, “and I don’t mean that in a critical sense.” Fictional liberties aside, there seems to be some of Mr. Carter in Reggie Vaughan, the cousin-manager. As Mr. Carter does in real life, Reggie preaches constantly that the family must think about long-term possibilities instead of short-term rewards. Mr. James, with Mr. Carter advising him, has been a savvy investor, often turning down lucrative endorsement offers unless he also gets some equity in the company. Mr. Carter was a crucial player in Mr. James’s 2010 decision to announce his signing with the Miami Heat with an “American Idol”-type TV special, “The Decision,” which turned into a public relations disaster. But he was also one of the strongest advocates for  Referring to the characters on the show, Mr. Carter said, “This is a family going through experiences and learning on the fly.” But he could just as easily have been talking about himself and Mr. James. The characters “are bits and pieces from all types of people I’ve met throughout my life,” he said. “The stories are made up,” he went on, “but the scenarios are all things that could happen. And some of them have.”
