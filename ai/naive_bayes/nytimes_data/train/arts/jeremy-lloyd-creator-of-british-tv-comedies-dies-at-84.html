Jeremy Lloyd, a creator of the long-running BBC comedy series “ ’Allo ’Allo!” and “Are You Being Served?,” died on Monday in a hospital near his home in London. He was 84. His agent, Alexandra Cann, who confirmed the death, said he was being treated for pneumonia. “Are You Being Served?” was a broad sendup of life in a British department store, based largely on Mr. Lloyd’s experiences as a salesman at a Piccadilly shop. The show was a hit in Britain, where it ran from 1972 until 1985, and also popular in the United States, Canada and Australia. It spawned multiple spinoffs and is still being shown on the BBC and on many PBS stations. “ ’Allo ’Allo!,” which ran from 1982 until 1992 (though it did not air in the 1990 season) — and which, like “Are You Being Served?,” Mr. Lloyd created with David Croft — was a World War II farce, filled with sexual innuendo, slapstick gags and overwrought accents, in which factions of British, French and Germans clashed in a small French cafe. Mr. Lloyd was also an actor. He had cameo roles in the Beatles films “A Hard Day’s Night” and “Help!” and was a regular, as both an actor and writer, on “Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-In” in the 1969-70 season. John Jeremy Lloyd was born on July 22, 1930, in England (sources differ on where) and lived with his grandmother in Manchester while growing up. Mr. Lloyd was married four times; one of his wives was the actress Joanna Lumley, best known as a co-star of the British sitcom “Absolutely Fabulous.” In June he married Elizabeth Moberly, who survives him. Information on other survivors was not immediately available.
