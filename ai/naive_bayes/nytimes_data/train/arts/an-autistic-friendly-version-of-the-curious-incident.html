An Autistic-Friendly Version of ‘The Curious Incident’
With expert help, the cast and crew of the Broadway play “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” have softened its sensory edges for an audience within the autism spectrum.

He cannot stand the color yellow or the color brown or loud noises or being touched or the way everyone thinks that rats, like his pet Toby, have the plague or something. Because they don’t. Rats are clean, people are too busy talking to look closely, and the boy — Christopher, in the  “I covered my ears,” said Harry David Smolin, 16, a theater buff with an autism diagnosis who attended a performance and on Thursday met the cast and crew at the Ethel Barrymore Theater. “Mostly I agreed with Christopher about everything. The big difference I saw between Christopher and me was that Christopher groaned and screamed. I don’t do that.” Mr. Smolin was in the house as an invited guest. On Sunday afternoon, the Theater Development Fund will help present the first autism-friendly version of a Broadway play. It has put on similar presentations of musicals like “Wicked” and “Lion King,” but “Curious Incident” is an emotionally treacherous story about a boy on the spectrum, and the young man was there to provide some guidance. The performance, a joint project of the fund’s Autism Theater Initiative and Britain’s National Theater, is an adaptation of the play in which many of the bursts of sound and light have been toned down. The National Theater, which produced the play, has staged two such “relaxed performances,” as they’re known in Britain, to packed houses. Donations for Sunday’s performance have reduced ticket prices to $25, and the anticipated audience includes teenagers and adults on the less severe end of the spectrum. “We are inviting in a new audience,” Ros Hayes, the National Theater’s head of access said. “We want them to become theater people.” The New York performance, like those in Britain, will involve no changes in the script or the performance itself. For hours last week, the associate director, Benjamin Endsley Klein, worked with engineers and autism specialists on dialing down blasts of sound and light that engage most audiences but can alienate people like Mr. Smolin. Strobe lights were eliminated; sounds levels dropped by 10 percent to 65 percent, depending on the effect; and the houselights were brought up to only about 30 percent of normal. That dim lighting allows for easier navigation of the theater and will also soften the effect of the opening scene, in which Christopher discovers a dead dog impaled on a pitchfork. To most audiences, the scene features slashes of light, framing the boy staring at the dog from different angles in a void of darkness. On Sunday the dim lights will soften the blow; the dog will come into focus gradually and not be a surprise. “But the impact of the play is about how Christopher experiences the world, and you don’t want that element lost,” said Lisa Carling, the director of accessibility programs at the fund, a nonprofit group that runs the TKTS discount ticket service, who is advising the production. The cultural landscape for families dealing with an autism diagnosis is relatively spare. Train exhibitions are popular; the one at the New York Transit Museum annex in  “In a therapeutic setting, we often encourage kids who are interested to try theater classes,” said Kevin Pelphrey, the director of the Child Neuroscience Laboratory at Yale, who has an autistic daughter. “Sometimes the exaggerated emotion they learn in theater will help teach how to better express the normal range.” “Curious Incident” can also touch so-called neurotypicals. The set is a rendering of the ordered, precise, emotionally muted interior of Christopher’s mind; it’s a box illuminated by a grid of lights, along which the boy moves, as if on tracks. “What’s beautiful about this movement to bring cultural events to people on the spectrum is it’s a way to show regular audiences what ‘differently abled’ is all about,” said Ron Suskind, whose book “Life, Animated” describes  Alex Sharp, who plays Christopher, said people on the spectrum who have seen the play react differently to his performance. “Some say, ‘That’s me — that’s a great representation,’ ” he said. “Others say they’re not like Christopher at all.” He added, “The only thing I can do is bring the character to life.” The audience on Sunday is likely to be full of life too, to put it mildly. People on the spectrum may groan and bark; rock in their seats; or stand up and walk out — or toward the stage. The fund will have 30 volunteers on hand to manage the crowd, many of them specialists who will help audience members find a quiet space, if needed, or settle down. The cast says it’s ready. “This is what audiences were like in Shakespeare’s day,” said Francesca Faridany, who plays Siobhan, Christopher’s teacher. “I think it’s exciting.” Mr. Smolin sure thinks so. Like Christopher, he likes small spaces, numbers, knowing exactly what time it is and identifying makes of cars. He used to be able to name every type on the road just by checking the grill design. He said he worked for a month on his speech to the “Curious Incident” group, because he doesn’t like surprises and he wants to be precise. He wandered off the script only once. “I love the theater and I have seen 45 different Broadway shows,” he read, and then glanced up from the page, adding: “I guess maybe that’s the most ever?” His audience roared.
