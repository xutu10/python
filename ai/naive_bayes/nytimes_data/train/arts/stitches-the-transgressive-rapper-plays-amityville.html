Stitches, the Transgressive Rapper, Plays Amityville
The rapper Stitches, whose video “Brick in Yo Face” has gone viral, performed on Sunday at the Amityville Music Hall on Long Island.

AMITYVILLE, N.Y. —  “I’m gonna pick one person,” Stitches said. Out in the Sunday night crowd at the Amityville Music Hall here, several young men — and one or two young women — were thrusting their hands to the sky, clamoring for a shot at immortality. Or at least a chance at touching a modern starburst, which here meant having Stitches — the Miami rapper whose manic, pneumatic-intensity video for  That’s brick as in cocaine (or flour, according to audience consensus). He threw it once, twice, three times at volunteers’ faces before sprinkling even more powder-filled plastic baggies over the crowd, covering a couple dozen or so in white mist. By this point, he was performing “Brick in Yo Face,” the song that had landed him here, in a fake-cocaine cloud, thanks especially to the video, which appeared online in April. It is rowdy, exaggerated, slightly comic fun: shock theater in the guise of a hip-hop video. In it, Stitches shout-raps about drug dealing — “I love selling blow!” is one of the refrains — and totes huge guns while mean-mugging the camera. In some scenes, a man dressed as Pinhead, from the “Hellraiser” series, throws white powder around a distressed-looking room. The clip became an instant classic in the ecosystem of  He is in Technicolor, the sort of visually specific personality that does well on the hip-hop Internet. He’s got a wispy Mohawk and gold-covered teeth, and he’s donated his body to the cause — his face, at least. It’s adorned with gruesome tattoos, including stitches creeping up several inches from the corners of his mouth, as if he’d just emerged from shoddy surgery. He also has an AK-47 inked on his right cheek. And he has one prodigiously effective shtick, which is to rap about cocaine — extensively and almost exclusively. It’s the main thrust of his mixtape, “No Snitching Is My Statement,” which is full of catchy hooks with fairly lumpy rapping in between them, all over industrial-strength Lex Lugeresque beats. Maybe Stitches, whose real name is Phillip Katsabanis, is telling the truth about his life, maybe he is a master of character. Whether everything in his back story — or his continuing story, for that matter — holds water is up for some debate. The Miami New Times alt-weekly recently published something of a  Whatever it took to get him here, Stitches is now doing the humdrum work of a striving rap star, which means performing — with studied abandon, backed by three hype men — to 100 or so people in this tiny music hall. At one point, he offered what appeared to be cocaine — from a small package in his pants — to fans in the crowd. He wore what looked like a cocaine spoon around his neck, and he dipped it in the package and then put it to the nose of one fan, who inhaled deeply. Before Stitches could get to the next fan, though, a security guard got in his way, so Stitches then took a couple of exaggerated hits himself. While people in the crowd might have been here because of “Brick in Yo Face,” they were familiar with the rest of Stitches’s songs, like “Facts,” which is partly a dis song aimed at Young Jeezy, and “Dirty Game,” which Stitches introduced by asking: “If you sold cocaine, would you sell it to a pregnant girl? If  Normally, a rising artist like Stitches would exit triumphantly after performing his big hit — in this case, performing it twice — but he seemed to want more from the night, or from the crowd, or from himself. What would have ordinarily been the show’s end was instead more like the midpoint. If he had his way, he said, it would have been actual cocaine he’d thrown in his fans’ faces, but the police were monitoring him, he insisted: “The next show I come out here, I promise I’ll bring a real brick and throw it in everybody face — they might fly in the air like Superman.” He’s been advertising a forthcoming mixtape, “Drug Lovers Only,” on his Instagram account, and played a couple of songs from it here, including collaborations with Trinidad James and DJ Mustard. He punched a crowd member who had appeared to insult him. And with a mildly exhausted air, he asked: “Y’all wanna see me do some more cocaine? How much cocaine you wanna see me do?” After taking some powder from the package in his pocket to his nose for the second time, he said, somewhat morbidly, “If I die onstage from a heart attack, y’all gonna remember me?” Then he repeated the question for emphasis, or because it sounded glamorous — it was tough to tell. It was transgressive, sure, but also the rote gesture of someone who has thrown so may bricks in so many faces that the thrill it used to provide has been dulled. “Who got a meet-and-greet?” he asked at the end of the night, and was met by several raised hands. “We gonna meet,” he said matter-of-factly, “and do some cocaine.”
