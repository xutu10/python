Charles James: ‘Beneath the Dress’
The implicit sexuality of James’s designs becomes explicit in his renderings of male bodies.
===
Nothing reflects the complex, sometimes fraught sensibility of the great fashion designer Charles James as completely as his drawings. Notable for their swings between distilled eroticism and raw sex, 25 of these efforts stood out in the superb James retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art this spring. Now there’s an excellent, if fleeting, chance to see some more. On view through Sunday, this exhibition presents 93 drawings from the 1960s and ’70s. Their subjects alternate between sleekly architectural garments and naked male bodies, often seen up close, from unexpected angles. All come from the collection of R. Couri Hay, a writer who works in public relations and was a confidant of James’s late in his life. James, who was gay but was married for a time and had two children, died in 1978 at 72. He frequently used drawing to revisit and update earlier designs. Yet the results are almost invariably lively, their forms still close to their often natural sources. Take the outlined closed-bud and dark plant-root shapes in a 1969 remembrance of a cape designed and made for Coco Chanel in 1937. A 1972 rendering of another dress from 1937 (for Salvador Dalí’s wife, Gala) diagrams the timeless simplicity of an asymmetrical neckline that culminates in the diagonal closure of a wrap dress. The implicit sexuality of James’s designs becomes explicit in his renderings of male bodies and pairs or groups of lovers, which tend to be full of scribbled lines, blunt color and desire. Like the drawings by Tom of Finland or Paul Cadmus, James’s works help balance centuries of lascivious depictions of women by men. Their distortions can also bring to mind Louise Bourgeois’s evocations of male genitalia and Lee Lozano’s satirical drawings of the same. The Met’s show established the importance of James’s garments within the scheme of 20th-century American art. Thanks to a gift from
