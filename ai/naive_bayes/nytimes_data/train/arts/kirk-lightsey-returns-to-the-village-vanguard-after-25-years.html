Kirk Lightsey Returns to the Village Vanguard After 25 Years
The pianist Kirk Lightsey made a rare appearance in New York at the Village Vanguard on Tuesday, showing audiences what they’ve been missing.

“Wow, it’s been so long since I’ve been in this place,” the pianist Kirk Lightsey said after taking the stage at the Village Vanguard on Tuesday night. Surveying the room, he chortled, wearing a look of beatific astonishment. He introduced the members of his quartet, and then restated the obvious: “I’m so happy to be back in town; I’m just giddy.” Jazz has long held special provisions for its prodigal sons, and in a certain light Mr. Lightsey, 77, seems to fit that bill. Born and raised in Detroit, he made his mark in New York during the early 1980s, fast becoming a prominent sideman and  With a few exceptions — notably a three-night stand at the Jazz Standard in 2006 — he hadn’t been back since.

Mr. Reid stamped its droning bass ostinato with a weighty authority, laying into an open string, while Mr. Lewis played a sly rhythmic game of tension and release. Mr. Lightsey soloed credibly on flute, but it was Mr. Cherry who lifted the tune, with a modern derivation of Wes Montgomery’s style. The closer was “
