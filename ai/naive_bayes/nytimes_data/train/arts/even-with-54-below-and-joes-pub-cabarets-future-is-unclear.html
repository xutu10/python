Cabaret is alive, stirring up excitement and receiving transfusions — thanks to young newcomers and old rockers — but no one can honestly say it’s in great health.

Descending the staircase into  There is nothing like the thrill of discovery, and during the past year 54 Below and its alt-cabaret equivalent, Joe’s Pub at the Public Theater, have been the best places in New York to find talent potentially strong enough to overcome the barrier facing singers outside the pop-rock-hip-hop mainstream where the fastest route to stardom is exposure on a TV talent show like “The Voice.” The most promising rising star to appear at 54 Below this year is  A tough cookie with a soft center, the fearless, Colorado-born Ms. Ashford, 29, is part of a lineage that stretches from Jean Harlow through Judy Holliday to Bette Midler, Madonna and  Because Ms. Ashford, currently stealing the show as the ballet-addicted daughter in the Broadway revival of  Other younger performers who came to 54 Below and Café Carlyle from Broadway or from television shows like “Glee” and “Smash” have included Jarrod Spector, Kate Baldwin, Katie Finneran, Sierra Boggess, Megan Hilty, Jeremy Jordan and Laura Osnes, all of whom have enthusiastic fan bases. Artistically, they may be a mixed bag. But whether good, bad or indifferent they represent the young blood that cabaret needs to lift it above the radar in a media climate that is blatantly, unapologetically ageist.

But getting her on television is virtually impossible. Fitful attempts to bring cabaret to television in a variety-show format have fizzled.

This year the cabaret stalwarts like Ms. Maye, Andrea Marcovicci and Steve Ross performed before enthusiastic audiences. But they were joined by a raft of questionable hopefuls who padded the concerts’ running time to four hours, the sort of thing that can give the genre a bad name. Even among the die-hard cabaret aficionados, complaints were widespread. The convention made a brave effort to showcase young male talent in a female-dominated field.
