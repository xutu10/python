Carolyn Kizer, Pulitzer-Winning Poet, Dies at 89
Ms. Kizer was known for political and satirical works that, she said, came with “a sting in the tail.”

Carolyn Kizer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose verse, overtly political and bitingly satirical, came, as she fondly put it, with “a sting in the tail,” died on Thursday in Sonoma, Calif. She was 89. The cause was complications of dementia, said the poet David Rigsbee, a friend and former student. Ms. Kizer’s poetry is known for its wit, deep intellectualism and rigorous craftsmanship; its stylistic hallmarks include impeccably calibrated rhyme, near-rhyme and meter. It is unsentimental, at times unsettling, but also luminous and warm. As a result of her painstaking way of working, and the length to which her poems could run, Ms. Kizer published fewer than a dozen collections in her lifetime. Composing, revising and assembling enough poems to fill a single volume could take a decade. She won the Pulitzer Prize in 1985 for her collection “Yin.” In a poem from the collection, “ I’m going to murder you with love; I’m going to suffocate you with embraces; I’m going to hug you, bone by bone, Till you’re dead all over. Then I will dine on your delectable marrow. Ms. Kizer’s work ranged over subjects so broad that it could confound critics bent on tidy classification. It was unmistakably feminist — she was writing as early as the 1950s about the conflict for women between the creative imperative and social expectations — but it was far different in character from that of her contemporary Adrienne Rich. Where the poems of Ms. Rich,  Ms. Kizer’s poetry could be autobiographical, spanning her childhood, her two marriages, the births of her three children and her friendships. But there was a steeliness to it — and a keen sense of humor — that distinguished it from the self-reflexive work of the confessional poets. She was sometimes called a poet of love and loss, a description whose murky universality irritated her greatly, for what poet’s work, at bottom, is not about those things? What she was actually concerned with, as  Her poem “Twelve O’Clock,” published in her 1996 collection, “Harping On,” is about precisely this. Rooted in a real incident in which the 17-year-old Ms. Kizer, visiting Princeton, caught sight of Albert Einstein in the university library, it interweaves scenes of  I stand in the center of the library And he appears. Are we witnesses or actors? The old man and the girl, smiling at each other, He fixed by fame, she fluid, still without identity. An instant which changes nothing. And everything, forever, everything is changed. Carolyn Ashley Kizer was born on Dec. 10, 1924, in Spokane, Wash., the late-life only child of parents to whom intellectual achievement was coin of the realm. Her mother, the former Mabel Ashley, was a biologist; her father, Benjamin Hamilton Kizer, was a lawyer. In her stark poem “Thrall,” Ms. Kizer wrote of her father’s inability to forge an emotional connection with his child. It opens, “The room is sparsely furnished:/A chair, a table, and a father.” At 17, Ms. Kizer had a poem, “When You Are Distant,” published in The New Yorker. But at the time, she later said, poetry was merely one of the many disciplines in which her parents had drilled her. She earned a bachelor’s degree from Sarah Lawrence College in 1945 and afterward did graduate work in Chinese at Columbia. She married Stimson Bullitt, the scion of a wealthy Seattle family, in 1946 and had three children in quick succession. During this time, she all but abandoned poetry. “I tell people I never got to hear Dylan Thomas read because my husband wouldn’t let me, because he thought it would be a sort of bad influence,” Ms. Kizer told The Los Angeles Times in 2001. “People say, ‘And you didn’t go?’ They’re so surprised because the me they know would have gone. And I say I was very much a ‘yes, dear’ wife.” Ms. Kizer and Mr. Bullitt were divorced in 1954. By this time she had resumed her poetic life, studying at the University of Washington, first with Theodore Roethke and later with Stanley Kunitz. It was only at Roethke’s urging, Ms. Kizer said, that she decided in earnest to become a poet. In 1959, Ms. Kizer helped found the journal  She went on to teach at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; the Iowa Writers’ Workshop; and elsewhere. Ms. Kizer’s first collection, “The Ungrateful Garden,” published in 1961, left little doubt that to her, the poetical was the political. In a poem from the volume, “The Death of a Public Servant,” about McCarthyism, she wrote: This is a day when good men die from windows, Leap from a sill of one of the world’s eyes Into the blind and deaf-and-dumb of time ... Dead friends, who were the servants of this world! Once there was a place for gentle heroes. Now they are madmen who, scuttling down corridors, Eluding guards, climb lavatory walls And squeeze through air-vents to their liberation. Much of her poetry concerned the lives of women — flesh-and-blood women like Ms. Kizer and her contemporaries as well as mythic figures like Semele, the mother of Dionysus. “We are the custodians of the world’s best-kept secret:/Merely the private lives of one-half of humanity,” Ms. Kizer wrote in “Pro Femina,” her best-known work. A five-part cycle, “ Part 3 ends, famously: If we submerge our self-pity in disciplined industry ... Keeping our heads and our pride while remaining unmarried; And if wedded, kill guilt in its tracks when we stack up the dishes And defect to the typewriter. And if mothers believe in the luck of our children, Whom we forbid to devour us, whom we shall not devour, And the luck of our husbands and lovers, who keep free women. “I used to get so many letters from students about the ending of ‘Pro Femina,’ ” Ms. Kizer said in the Paris Review interview. “So I had a stamp made that said  Ms. Kizer’s politics were not confined to paper. In 1998, for instance, she and Maxine Kumin resigned as chancellors of the  A resident of Sonoma, Ms. Kizer is survived by two daughters, Ashley Bullitt and Jill Bullitt, and a son, Fred Nemo, all from her first marriage; two stepchildren, Larry Woodbridge and Pamela Woodbridge; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. Her second husband, the architect John Marshall Woodbridge, whom she married in 1975, died in June. As many poets do, Ms. Kizer wrote occasional poetry, but hers did not sound like anyone else’s. What occasioned her occasional poetry was not inaugurations and grand openings but the stuff of ordinary life. One such poem was born in a fit of pique after Ms. Kizer attempted  The literary result, “Mud Soup” — a cautionary tale that still pulsates with trochaic abandon — is quoted here at some length in belated contrition: Sauté pork and add the veggies, Add the garlic, cook ten minutes, Add to lentils, add to ham bone; Add the bay leaf, cloves in cheesecloth, Add the cayenne! Got no cayenne! Got paprika, salt, and pepper. Bring to boil, reduce heat, simmer. Did I say that this is summer? Simmer, summer, summer, simmer. Mop the floor and suck the finger. Mop the brow with old potholder. ... Tastes like mud, the finished product. Looks like mud, the finished product. Consistency of mud the dinner. (Was it lentils, Claiborne, me?) Flush the dinner down disposal, Say to hell with ham bone, lentils, New York Times recipe. Purchase Campbell’s. Just add water. Concentrate on poetry: By the shores of Gitche Gumee You can bet the banks were muddy, Not like Isle of Innisfree.
