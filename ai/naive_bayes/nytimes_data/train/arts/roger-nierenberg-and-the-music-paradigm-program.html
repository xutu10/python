Roger Nierenberg and the Music Paradigm Program
The conductor Roger Nierenberg uses his Music Paradigm program to teach corporate employees and managers leadership skills through music.

I couldn’t have been more skeptical. I couldn’t have been more wrong. The conductor Roger Nierenberg took his  But no, I quickly realized, he was making real music and making good sense. “An orchestra is a great place to model organizational dysfunction,” he said at the outset without apparent irony. Mr. Nierenberg, 67, had with him 26 string players, mostly from the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, who took seats front and center, surrounded by the nurses, but stood when they performed. He had rehearsed the players straightforwardly in Samuel Barber’s soulful Adagio for Strings for an hour beforehand, but he had not prepared them in any other way for the unscripted event about to unfold. Now, he continued to rehearse them in public, running through snippets and discussing those with players and audience alike, drawing lessons in leadership from the work of the conductor and the interactions of the players. More and more, he did model dysfunction. He showed how a performance might be adversely affected if the conductor micromanaged with his baton, eyes and gestures, or if the conductor were simply disengaged or fidgety. He had the players shift their focus to a particular colleague and attune their playing to complement one another’s. He had them perform with a conductor, then without a conductor and with eyes closed, to show how adept they were at intuitively adjusting to others on their own. He had them start the piece at different tempos of their choice and alter tempos spontaneously, slowing down, perhaps, in midstream. The musicians were called on to speak as well as play, and audience members were occasionally drafted into action. The watchword throughout was listening: players listening to one another and to the conductor, but just as much, the conductor listening to the players, how they sound, what they say. This went on for some 75 minutes. Then the orchestra, with Mr. Nierenberg in place, performed the Adagio complete, beautifully, and departed to huge applause. Mr. Nierenberg and the audience stayed behind for a half-hour and discussed what had just happened, the nurses in tones equally disbelieving and enraptured. It takes a healthy ego to take on a project like this. (Then again, it takes a healthy ego to be a conductor, period.) Mr. Nierenberg is presumably trying to model the best podium skills and behavior as well as the worst. Does he have the goods? “Absolutely,” said David Chan, who has been a concertmaster in the Met Orchestra since 2000. (Mr. Nierenberg is Roddy to Mr. Chan and other Met players, not because he has conducted them but because his wife, Deborah Hoffman, who died in February, was the Met’s principal harpist for many years.) Working with Mr. Nierenberg was a joy, Mr. Chan said. “For me,” he added of the program, “I had never thought of the skill sets we’re asked to learn in a ‘real world’ context.” Katherine Fong, another violinist of 14 years’ experience at the Met, seconded Mr. Chan on all counts. “It’s inspiring to musicians,” she said, “to learn that what we do every day can really matter to others.” Several of the participating nurses were equally laudatory of Mr. Nierenberg and the program. “I never got so many emails,” Wilhelmina Manzano, the senior vice president and chief nursing officer at NewYork-Presbyterian, said of the positive response she received. “The experience is something you live, not just another death-by-PowerPoint presentation.” The Music Paradigm is an outgrowth of Mr. Nierenberg’s outreach efforts as music director of the Stamford Symphony in Connecticut from 1980 to 2004 and of the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra in Florida from 1984 to 1998. In Jacksonville, he invited the orchestra’s board members to sit among the players during rehearsals in an attempt to inspire and energize them; in Stamford he did the same with children, to try to awaken a passion for music. Since 1995, hundreds of corporations and organizations in 23 countries, including The New York Times, have engaged the Music Paradigm (which in turn hires the musicians) to mount sessions for their employees. The program has largely swallowed up Mr. Nierenberg’s conducting career. “I would like to change the balance a little,” he acknowledged in an interview. Still, he seems understandably loath to back off from a program that he dearly loves, for the positive responses it elicits from participants, and that also happens to be a runaway success. In 2009, Mr. Nierenberg tried to translate the Music Paradigm into book form, with “Maestro: A Surprising Story About Leading by Listening” (Portfolio), with limited success. It is a novelistic treatment with a contrived premise, involving a somewhat doltish manager in a manufacturing concern who is allowed to observe rehearsals of the local orchestra and then debrief its conductor at considerable length to glean lessons for his firm. “Every word that I speak, every inflection in my tone of voice, every gesture is directed toward the goal of creating a feeling of community,” the maestro says. “A community simply acts faster, more intelligently, more creatively and with more joy than a group that is primarily focused on its leader.” What the book most painfully lacks and what the live session so brilliantly conveyed is what Mr. Nierenberg calls the driving force of the Music Paradigm in the first place, “the power of music.”
