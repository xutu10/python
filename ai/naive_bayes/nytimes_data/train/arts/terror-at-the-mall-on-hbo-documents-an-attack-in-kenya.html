‘Terror at the Mall’ on HBO Documents an Attack in Kenya
Dan Reed’s documentary “Terror at the Mall” uses footage from security cameras and cellphones, as well as photographs, to document a Shabab attack on civilians in Kenya.

One year ago, gunmen from the Shabab militant group in Somalia laid  The British filmmaker Dan Reed assembled thousands of hours of footage gleaned from more than 100 security cameras inside the mall, video from television crews and modest cellphones, as well as still photographs. Then he and his team tracked down more than 200 people and interviewed 82 of them on camera, many survivors or their rescuers. The result is a harrowing hourlong documentary, “ Mr. Reed employs an immersive, you-are-there approach, with no academic experts to orient viewers about how the Shabab arose or why the group would want to attack shoppers in Kenya. Witnesses recount passing references by their attackers to revenge for Kenya’s invasion of Somalia in 2011. “What I’ve tried to do is create a sense of the intimacy of violence,” Mr. Reed, 49, said in an interview at HBO’s Manhattan headquarters last week, shortly before the premiere screening. “It’s that collision of worlds that happens in a protected space. There they are eating cake at the cafe. Here they are lying in a pool of blood.” It is telling about the state of the world that “Terror at the Mall” is Mr. Reed’s third television film about a deadly urban siege in just 11 years. In 2003, he made “Terror in Moscow,” about the dayslong standoff at a Moscow theater with Chechens armed with guns and wearing suicide vests, and in 2009, his “Terror in Mumbai” chronicled the spree of shootings and bombings there by members of the Pakistan-based militants Lashkar-e-Taiba. Mr. Reed began his directing career with a BBC documentary on South Africa that involved embedding with a Cape Town gang for eight months. He said in a follow-up email that he spends between eight and 10 months on the siege films and is “usually on the ground three weeks after the event, or as soon as the news crews have gone.” He added that he struggled at times with steeping himself in such dark material. “Making this one really broke my heart,” Mr. Reed said. “I don’t know if I can do this kind of film again.” His latest film arrives at a moment when the videotaped murders of two journalists and an aid worker by a masked killer from the extremist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have raised pointed questions about whether media outlets should air — or viewers watch — footage of violent acts perpetrated in part to generate publicity. At times “Terror at the Mall” feels like a found-footage horror film, with bodies twitching as the militants fire and survivors describing the “thud” of a bullet striking a body. In the collage he has assembled, the bursts of high-resolution images by the Reuters photographer  The assault on the Westgate shopping mall, in which at least 67 people were killed, was the Shabab’s most high-profile attack abroad, devastating but also attention grabbing in a way that the constant series of car bombings and shootings in Mogadishu are not. Before ISIS thrust itself onto militancy’s center stage, a stream of ethnic Somalis from Europe and the United States along with Muslim converts headed to the Horn of Africa to fight alongside the Qaeda-aligned group. In spite of the spotlight on ISIS, recent events demonstrate that policy makers and military planners in Washington remain focused on fighting the Shabab. American officials recently declared that an airstrike had killed the group’s leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, one of the most wanted men in Africa. “It’s difficult to glamorize or see these men as heroes,” Mr. Reed said during a question-and-answer session after the screening. While the film showed the capricious cruelty of the men, it also demonstrated the humanity of the victims, he said. Time and again, across lines of race and class, people scooped up lost children, dragged wounded people from the line of fire, made room in hiding places until they were lying on top of one another. “We don’t know each other,” Valentine Kadzo says in the film. Ms. Kadzo hid with strangers in a tiny display stand for hours. “We all come from different communities, but at that time we were one. I’ll always treasure that moment because everyone was caring about the other.”
