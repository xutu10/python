At the American Contract Bridge League’s fall championships in Providence, R.I., the first two national titles were won on Saturday evening. The Smith Life Master Women’s Pairs was captured by Bronia Jenkins of Vero Beach, Fla., and Bernace De Young of Miami. They led after each of the four sessions, finishing three-tenths of a board ahead of Victoria Gromova and Tatiana Ponomareva from Russia. The Russians, who were second after each session, won this event in 2012. Third were Ljudmila Kamenova of South Setauket, N.Y., and Linda Lewis of Las Vegas. In the Nail Life Master Open Pairs, Venkatrao Koneru of San Antonio and Jim Krekorian of Pensacola, Fla., finished less than a third of a board ahead of Wael Mohsen and Reda Wasfi Yaacoub from Egypt, with Jay Borker of Greenwich, Conn., and Doug Doub of West Hartford, Conn., third. This was De Young’s first national title after four second-place finishes. She and Jenkins said that they played solidly and bid all of their slams. They defended beautifully in the diagramed deal, which was sent to me by Brent Manley, who is editing the daily bulletins with Paul Linxwiler. After a straightforward auction to four spades, Jenkins (West) led her singleton club jack. South won with her ace and misguessed spades by leading low to dummy’s eight and losing to East’s jack. At this point, most players sitting East would have given their partner a club ruff and failed to defeat the contract. West would have ruffed and shifted to a heart, but declarer could have won with dummy’s ace and discarded her second heart on the club king. West could have ruffed, but only with her spade ace. And if she did not ruff, South could have pitched a diamond on the club queen, then crossruffed home. Instead, De Young (East), correctly reading the full layout, led a low heart at Trick 3. Declarer took West’s king with dummy’s ace and played another trump, but West won the trick with her ace, led a heart to her partner’s queen and now received a club ruff to defeat the contract. Plus 50 was worth 20 out of 25 match points to the champions. The semifinals of the Baze Senior Knockout Teams are Monday, and the final is Tuesday, with play live at
