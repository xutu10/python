‘100 Things to Do Before High School,’ on Nickelodeon
In “100 Things to Do Before High School,” three seventh-grade friends are expecting life as they know it to end at the conclusion of middle school in this new offering from Nickelodeon.

Is there a minimum age requirement for having a bucket list? Apparently not, because on a cute new offering from Nickelodeon, three seventh-grade friends have one. Sort of. They aren’t expecting to kick the bucket, but they are expecting life as they know it to end once they hit high school. And thus  It is CJ (Isabela Moner) who first realizes, thanks to a funny “Glee”-parody dream, that the overscheduling and new interests looming in high school will cost her her two best friends, Fenwick (Jaheem Toombs) and Crispo (Owen Joyner). In truth, they are already drifting away with the start of seventh grade. So she concocts a scheme to renew their bonds that she knows they won’t be able to resist: rescuing a raccoon that has been imprisoned by the school science teacher. There follows a fast-paced story of mayhem and poor educational theory that will make you glad your child doesn’t attend their school but that has a decent number of amusing moments, especially for the middle-school-and-younger audience aimed for here.
