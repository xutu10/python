Janis Martin Her death was confirmed by her son, Robert, who said she had had diabetes for many years. Ms. Martin made her debut at the San Francisco Opera as Theresa in Bellini’s “La Sonnambula” in 1960, when she was just 21. The youngest artist to sing key roles with the company at the time, she traveled to New York City shortly afterward to see if she was good enough to reach a larger audience. At first she sang in churches and even an Italian restaurant to survive, sometimes singing arias that stretched her range. “During the next two years I developed an enormous range, so that by 1962 the coloring was dark but very clear, something that confused a lot of people as to whether I was a mezzo or a soprano,” she told Opera News in 1971.

Over the next decades she performed under Karl Böhm, Georg Solti and other conductors at venues in Paris, Vienna, Barcelona, Rome, Hong Kong, Tokyo and elsewhere. She last performed at the Met in 1997 as Brünnhilde in “Die Walküre,” with Plácido Domingo as Siegmund and Deborah Voigt as Sieglinde. Janis Lenere Martin was born into a family of amateur musicians in Sacramento, Calif., on Aug. 16, 1939. She graduated from El Camino High School and studied at Sacramento State University and the University of California, Berkeley. After studying singing for a few months and learning three arias, she sought in 1958 to audition for the Merola Opera training program, which helps prepare would-be singers for the San Francisco Opera. The conductor Kurt Adler, who was overseeing the auditions, said that she was too young for the program but that he would train her regardless. He also gave her a standing-room pass to the War Memorial Opera House, which proved invaluable. Though she had listened to opera growing up, she had never seen one staged. “It fascinated me, like a new toy,” Ms. Martin said. Her opportunity presented itself, she said, when she filled in for a singer who became ill. They were each supposed to perform two scenes from four different operas to be broadcast on San Francisco public television. Ms. Martin performed all four. She signed with the company. She also had a star turn onscreen, playing an opera singer in the 1992  Ms. Martin was married twice, to Boris Rybka and Gerhard Helwig. Both marriages ended in divorce. In addition to her son, she is survived by a brother, Richard, and two grandchildren.
