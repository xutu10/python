A Shaker Village Finds Enterprise Is Not So Simple 
The Hancock Shaker Village in Massachusetts, a window into a religious sect that embraced celibacy and social tenets of egalitarianism and pacifism, is struggling financially.

PITTSFIELD, Mass. —  Hancock Shaker Village, a cluster of historic houses, barns and shops set here amid gardens and cow pastures, has long sought to preserve the culture and traditions of the Shakers, the small but influential religious sect that became as well known for its minimalist furniture as for its social tenets of egalitarianism and pacifism. Since the 1960s visitors have come to this living history museum to see life as the Shakers experienced it, in structured and disciplined communities that embraced a practice of celibacy that ultimately hindered their growth. From a peak of approximately 5,000 in the mid-19th century, practicing Shakers now number just three at the last active settlement, in New Gloucester, Me. The  Attendance is down by nearly a third compared with a decade ago, to about 50,000 visitors a year. Donations and government support have also dwindled. The annual budget, never particularly robust, has been cut by a quarter, to $1.6 million. Yet Shaker furniture, which has become the sect’s cultural calling card, is experiencing a renewed interest. The art dealer Philippe Ségalot will have a  High-end art collectors are rediscovering the Shakers, said Willis Henry, founder of an auction house that has specialized in Shaker artifacts for more than 30 years. “The market has started to move upwards and will continue to move that way,” he said. Despite all that, core programs have been reduced at Hancock Shaker Village, and maintenance of historic buildings has been deferred. The number of staff members, including interpreters in period dress who discuss Shaker teachings and techniques, has been similarly cut. Secure, climate-controlled display and storage space is scarce, and in 2010 the museum decided it could no longer remain open to the public year-round; it now accepts guests from April through November. “I think the biggest loss for us, the place we hurt the most, other than in fund-raising and not having enough staff, is education,” said Linda Steigleder, president and chief executive of the site since 2012. A decline in school visits, partly a result of decreased government funding, has contributed to the village’s shrinking attendance and, more important, threatens the site’s ability to connect with a new generation. Ms. Steigleder believes that, more than ever, the Shakers have something to share with society. “The Shakers were way ahead of their time, and there are so many things they were doing in the 1780s and ’90s up through the 19th century that we think is cool today,” she said. She cited their support of gender equality, adherence to sustainable practices, early adoption of technological innovations, entrepreneurship and communal responsibility. “They were doing it all,” she said. The Shakers arrived in the United States around the time of the American Revolution, led by Ann Lee and her singular brand of Christianity, which posited the Second Coming of Christ as an individual, internal revelation; pursued labor as a path to holiness; and called for celibate, near-monastic communal living. They soon established settlements throughout the Northeast, and Hancock Shaker Village was born in the late 1780s. (Despite a phonetic and connotative similarity, the Shakers, formally known as the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing, are not related to the Quakers, though Ann Lee may have been theologically influenced by them.) The village ceased to function as an active Shaker residence in 1960 and, thanks to the determination of local residents, soon became a museum. General interest in the Shakers reached a peak in the 1980s and early 1990s in the long wake of the American bicentennial, with several high-profile exhibitions and a spotlight on Shaker artifacts, thanks partly to celebrity collectors like Oprah Winfrey. But the founders of the village never established a permanent endowment, and the museum fell victim to some of the same pressures that affect rural heritage museums across the country: a loss of donors after the recession and reductions in government spending on historic preservation. “Back when Hancock became a museum, there were not a lot of other museums in the Berkshires,” said Mary Rentz, a board member and longtime volunteer. “Now, in terms of living here, it’s wonderful. In terms of being a cultural institution, there’s only so many ways people can be pulled philanthropically and with their time.” Among the village’s successful Berkshire County neighbors are the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown and the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge. But many of the current struggles are also a result of several bold initiatives that the village tried in recent years that did not pay off. For example, a master’s program in historic preservation, created in partnership with the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has been well received but not so beneficial to the village’s bottom line. Perhaps the biggest gamble was the introduction of a rental program for special events on the scenic grounds. A grant supported the initial research and staffing, but when that ran out the rental duties fell to the lone development officer, who splits her time between wedding planning and fund-raising. “We had a view that by investing in certain earned-income opportunities we could grow the institution,” Ms. Rentz said. “In the past few years it’s been obvious that that’s not the case.” In the two years since Ms. Steigleder’s arrival, Hancock Shaker Village, on a bare-bones budget, has returned to operating in the black. The days of deficit spending are over, Ms. Steigleder said, and there is a sense of cautious optimism about the future. Several other small but notable developments feed the sense of a resurging interest in the Shakers: a new exhibition at the New York State Museum in Albany (through March 6, 2016); a show at the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Me. (through March 8); a glossy book, “The Shakers: From Mount Lebanon to the World” (Rizzoli); and a well-received production by the Wooster Group, “Early Shaker Spirituals,” that returns to New York in April. Other Shaker sites have managed to reinvent themselves: Canterbury Shaker Village in New Hampshire opened a culinary arts school on its site in late 2013, while Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill in Harrodsburg, Ky., has found a degree of stability as a tourist getaway, merging history and hospitality. “You have to turn the village into a business to be self-sustaining,” Daniel Cain, the Hancock Shaker Village’s new board chairman, said. “In the words of the Shakers, we have to be enterprising.” In that vein, the village is exploring collaborations with like-minded organizations, including a Shaker site at Mount Lebanon, N.Y., just a few miles down the road. The village also received a grant to study the feasibility of a merger with the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Mass., and talks are underway. In facing the challenge of making the Shaker story relevant today, and setting the village apart as a dynamic destination, its stewards take inspiration from those whose values they seek to preserve. “The original Shaker literature said, ‘We will dwindle, and then we will regenerate,’ ” Ms. Steigleder said.
