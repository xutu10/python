Gibney Dance Expands in Lower Manhattan
The choreographer Gina Gibney has renovated a building downtown to provide performance and rehearsal space and more as part of Gibney Dance’s vision.

Gina Gibney gets terribly excited about the efficient use of space. That’s not so remarkable, considering that she has been a choreographer in New York for nearly 25 years. The use of space is at the core of a choreographer’s art; choreographers in New York struggle, now more than ever, to find space to work. But Ms. Gibney isn’t just zealous about space for her own art making. She makes space available to others. Her saving of space rescues it for dance. Most recently and remarkably, she has saved 36,000 square feet at 280 Broadway, next to City Hall, in the two-story building where Dance New Amsterdam moved in 2006 to escape rising rents in Greenwich Village but vacated after declaring bankruptcy a year ago. Ms. Gibney’s organization,  While giving a recent tour, Ms. Gibney was voluble about every detail of the renovation. She pointed out how one part of the ground-floor lobby, barely used by Dance New Amsterdam, was being transformed into a high-tech performance lab and another part into a kitchen for catering revenue-generating events. She noted how one small studio had been carved out of the office and how a large one could be converted into a theater. She was equally excited about using an odd-shaped little zone by the elevators. She said all this amid the noise of construction on the ground floor, the sound of classes and rehearsals in the upstairs studios and the harmonizing of a group that had rented the main theater. The space was already in use, though much of what Ms. Gibney described was not yet finished. She resembled any choreographer showing a new piece in rehearsal, explaining how the lighting was going to look and where the missing dancer would go. But this choreographer’s vision was already making an impact much larger than usual. Since its founding in 1991, Gibney Dance has had a home at 890 Broadway, at East 19th Street, where American Ballet Theater also has space. Until recently, it was a small home, a single studio that Gibney Dance rented out for classes and rehearsals while sustaining itself with irregular grants. It was only when that space was nearly lost that the company began to expand. The recession that started in 2008 almost put it out of business. As sources of revenue disappeared, Ms. Gibney decided to prioritize the studio, sometimes delaying the payroll to make up back rent. As never before, she focused on her finances and developed a relationship with her landlord, Eliot Feld’s  The gamble paid off. The negative cash flow turned positive. And in 2011, when even more space opened, three or four times as large as her original studio and in need of renovation, she persuaded Mr. Feld to let her expand there, too. “There’s magic in art, and there’s magic in numbers,” said Ms. Gibney, who calls herself an Excel geek. “I learned the economics of space and how to allocate it.” She developed a two-tier pricing model, with commercial renters like Broadway shows subsidizing lower rates for nonprofit dance companies and choreographers. This model proved sustainable, and the stability attracted funders. “I don’t want to go a funder and say, ‘Help,’ ” she explained. “I want to say: ‘We’ve built this. It works. Advance it.’ ” It was this attitude that prompted New York’s Department of Cultural Affairs to contact Ms. Gibney about 280 Broadway. Unless the city could find another cultural tenant, the building’s landlord would have the right to make the space commercial. The stakes were large, as was the risk. But Ms. Gibney took it. The Agnes Varis Trust backed her up with a $3 million gift. This month, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation announced a contribution of $750,000 to Gibney Dance’s residency program Dance in Process. The program is now part of a shift in which the 890 Broadway studios, when not rented by commercial clients, will largely be reserved for the choreographic process, while the 280 Broadway space will be, in Ms. Gibney’s organizational language, “public facing.” At 280 Broadway, a Community Action Hub, an expansion of Ms. Gibney’s longtime work with survivors of domestic violence, will house social action workshops. In the Leadership and Learning Studio, artists can learn business skills. And in the theaters, dancers will face audiences. The three theaters put Gibney Dance in the new position of presenter. Its programming will begin on Nov. 5, with a six-week series called DoublePlus. Craig Peterson, who took the position of director of programs and presentation in June, has invited six mentor-choreographers (including Annie-B Parson, RoseAnne Spradlin and Miguel Gutierrez) each to select two younger or lesser-known artists. Ms. Gibney acknowledged a tension between the decision-making power of choosing which artists perform and her organization’s values of access, openness and “aesthetic neutrality.” Mr. Peterson stressed that the overall ideal of “aesthetic neutrality” would not mean that 280 Broadway had no aesthetic identity. Both Ms. Gibney and Mr. Peterson emphasized being guided by the needs of dancers. Before and during the renovation, there have been numerous town hall meetings, focus groups, surveys and one-on-one conversations. Yet Ms. Gibney expressed some irritation about how “when you started to talk about audience, it was like a blank stare.” She wants to attract new audiences. Putting a theater on the ground floor is one part of her plan. Making the space inviting is another. But even more, what she wants to change is the attitudes of dancers and choreographers about themselves. “I’ve lived that life for a long time,” she said, “and I’ve seen it get more difficult. The challenges have worn the dance world down a bit. There are so many bright and resourceful people, but they’ve been in the doldrums. I want to get the sights up higher.”
