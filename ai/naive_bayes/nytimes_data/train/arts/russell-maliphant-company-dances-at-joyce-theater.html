Russell Maliphant Company Dances at Joyce Theater
The Russell Maliphant Company presented five works in its “Still Current” program at the Joyce Theater.

Picture a beautiful body, perhaps two, imprisoned in a pool of delicate light. The dance starts slowly, in near silence, with limbs curving inward or stretching to a high corner. But as the sound increases in density and speed, so does the motion. It flows and flows, swirling and changing shape as the light changes shape around it. This could go on forever, but at some point it stops. That description would fit any of the five pieces that the  In the oldest piece, “Two,” from 1997, Carys Staton is striking. The luxuriant modeling of Mr. Maliphant’s choreography gives this solo an aspect of a pole dancer in a cage, but Ms. Staton doesn’t overdo it. The lighting — here and throughout the program by Michael Hulls — is attentive and impressive, framing the dancer in an almost palpable box. Both the work and Ms. Staton’s performance are incredibly precise, but what precisely are they expressing? In the United States premiere of “Still,” it is Dickson Mbi who is corralled. Bands of light make his extraordinary bare torso appear even more muscled, and a rolling strobe makes him seem to be moving even when he is not. His low, slow circling builds to explosive pops. Drums in the score suggest (with some silliness) an arena or labyrinth, an effect reinforced when Ms. Staton arrives to circle him warily. But neither dancer in this work has anywhere to go. “Afterlight (Part One),” from 2009, is the most substantial variation. It is helped — held together and given a firmer shape — by four of Satie’s Gnossiennes. Mr. Hulls’s glowing pool spreads and shrinks like a layer of fog. The choreography’s development — more smoothly graduated than in the other works, its grounded revolutions artfully spiked with jumps — generates and maintains a stronger, if still subdued, current. Thomasin Gulgec dances it with virile grace. “Still Current,” the 2013 duet from which the program takes its title, also has a bit more to it. Cantilevered bodies stretch its rubbery structure. What were leaps in “Afterlight” become lifts here. The light fades in and out, expands and contracts, eventually separating the two dancers into squares and rectangles of their own, then bringing them back together. Flickering, it hints at something awry between this woman and man (Ms. Staton and the elegant Marlon Dino, filling in for an injured Mr. Maliphant). But while pretty to look at, “Still Current,” the piece and the whole, proves vaporous. However gorgeous, light needs something more to illuminate.
