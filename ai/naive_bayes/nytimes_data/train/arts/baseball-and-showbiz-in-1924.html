Baseball and Showbiz in 1924
Exactly 90 years ago, President Calvin Coolidge was attending a baseball game, Groucho and Harpo Marx were doing vaudeville, and Douglas Fairbanks was happy-go-lucky.

90 YEARS AGO  New York baseball fans had their storybook ending last week with Derek Jeter’s last at-bat at Yankee Stadium. A better story might have tacked on a chapter called “October.” New Yorkers got that chapter in 1924. In The Times on the first Friday of the month, the Pennsylvania Railroad advertised “Fast trains to the World’s Series baseball games” in Washington, where the Giants were set to play the Senators. “Fast” meant more than five hours, but it must be assumed that many fans rode those trains that weekend to see their Giants win the first game and lose the second in the first World Series held in Washington. A whiff of a bribery scandal followed some of the Giants on their way to the postseason. But even though Washington spectators gave the Giants the “silent treatment,” The Times reported, more attention was paid to one Senators fan in attendance: President Calvin Coolidge. The Times noted that a spectator’s tossed newspaper hit the president in the hat, and that the first lady, more of an aficionado of the sport than her husband, kept the box score. “As soon as he reached his box the President settled down to enjoy himself. He is accustomed to smoke a cigar after lunch — a custom which is very strong — and he was compelled to get his after-lunch smoke at the game. He puffed a cigar slowly so that the smoke should not descend into the eyes of Mrs. Coolidge.” “He went there determined to be impartial in his applause,” The Times account reads, “but in the end, like most of the others, became an enthusiastic rooter for the Washington team.” (President Obama, take note, in case the Nationals continue their run.) “This was the first time the Chief Executive and so many officials of this and other Governments had deserted domestic and international affairs to attend the great American game,” The Times reported. And the storybook ending? It went to Washington in 1924, even though New York won in the 12th thrilling inning on the Saturday the president attended. The series went to seven games,  For those New Yorkers remaining in the city on that first weekend in October 1924, there were other amusements. “The Thief of Bagdad,” starring Douglas Fairbanks, had opened in the spring and was still drawing moviegoers to the Liberty cinema. “Last 7 days,” an ad in The Times reminded stragglers. The Times review had enthused at the Jazz Age version of special effects. “The trick photography is in no place better than where the magic carpet is introduced.” As for Fairbanks, he was “his happy-go-lucky self throughout the picture,” and in much of it “is bronzed and naked to his waist line, showing a fine depth of chest and impressively muscular arms.” Onstage, a vaudeville revue was in its “6th capacity month” at the Casino Theater. “Just about the two funniest clowns around the village at present are a pair of the Four Marx Brothers, whose antics provide the main excuse for ‘I’ll Say She Is,’ ” the Times review said. The two? Groucho and Harpo, although their given names, Julius and Arthur, were used in the review. John Corbin of The Times wrote, “They are gorgeous clowns and uproariously funny.”
