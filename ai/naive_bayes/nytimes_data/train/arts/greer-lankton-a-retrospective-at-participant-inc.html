‘Greer Lankton,’ a Retrospective at Participant Inc.
The works in “Greer Lankton: Love Me” delve into the artist’s skill and her gender-bending life.
===
Greer Lankton was one of the most intrepid artists of the East Village 1980s, though the mainstream New York world never knew what to make of her determinedly underground art. The small career retrospective called “ Lankton was born Greg Robert Lankton in Michigan in 1958, the child of a Presbyterian minister. With the support of her family, she had sexual reassignment surgery in 1979, when she was 21 and an art school student in New York. She settled in the East Village and became an integral part of the blossoming art scene there. On casual acquaintance, she came across as low-key, even demure, and meticulously put together. Her art is put together too, though demure is not the word for it. As seen at Participant, her stitched and painted soft-sculpture figures, from doll-size to life-size, add up to a kind of club-crowd crush of priapic trolls, hermaphrodites and addicts, joined by portraits of celebrities (Jacqueline Kennedy), fashion stars (Diana Vreeland) and gender-bending luminaries (Candy Darling, Teri Toye). To some extent, every Lankton image was a self-portrait. In technique, the work is beyond exquisite. Made from fabric sewn over wire armatures, and incorporating glass eyes and human hair, some figures are fitted with custom-made clothes and accessories. Many, though, are nude. As it was in early feminism and would become again in art of the 1990s, the body was Lankton’s primary subject: gorgeous, gross, absurd, sick and, above all, mutable, bulking up, thinning down, ever-changing. One small early figure looks as desiccated as a mummy; another — a life-size, blue-skinned figure titled “Princess Pamela,” on loan from the singer Iggy Pop — is a full-bodied vamp. Here and there in the show, detached genitals appear in shrine-like containers, as if waiting to be claimed. In the 1980s, the sculptures filled Lankton’s small studio apartment, and spilled over into galleries, clubs and a neighborhood storefront boutique co-managed by her partner, Paul Monroe. Her work attracted lots of attention in the East Village and even outside it: Her figure of Vreeland made it into a Barneys window. (Now in the collection of the Met’s Costume Institute, it’s in the show.) But in the 1990s, interest in her waned, she and Mr. Monroe separated, and she left New York for Chicago. A lot has happened in both art and gender politics since then. After two decades under the radar, Lankton is now, in some sense, a prophet come home. Still, a case needs to be made for her, and Lia Gangitano, founding director of Participant Inc., makes it, with terrific panache, in an installation of two ganged-together groups of sculptures surrounded by dozens of photographs of the artist by friends and peers (Nan Goldin, Peter Hujar, Zoe Leonard and others). In addition, in a miracle of research, there two vitrines full of related memorabilia, much of it from the Greer Lankton Archive Museum, which is overseen by Mr. Monroe. The East Village world Lankton lived in was devastated by AIDS; she died of a drug overdose. Mortality enwraps her story. But so does a sense of passed-on vitality, felt in the work of contemporary artists like Nathalie Djurberg and Basil Twist, whom she prefigured. And hovering over the exhibition itself are spirits from the past: Hans Bellmer, Egon Schiele. Lankton’s art brings them straight to mind. And she’s right up there, in some kind of underground heaven, with them.
