Simone Dinnerstein, the Pianist, Goes Beyond Bach at the Met
The pianist Simone Dinnerstein’s imaginative recital at the Met had distinct halves and mixed results.

Simone Dinnerstein The first half offered a wonderfully imaginative sequence, beginning with Francis Poulenc’s delectable “Suite Française” (1935). This is a piano arrangement of a chamber work, itself based on dances and other works composed or arranged by Claude Gervaise in the 16th century (though you wouldn’t have known any of this from the Met’s program leaflet, which was shamefully devoid of serious notes or even composition dates). Then came Debussy’s “Suite Bergamasque” (1890; revised 1905), which carried the French dance theme forward and offered a relatively rare opportunity to hear “Clair de Lune” in context, as the third of four movements. George Crumb’s “A Little Suite for Christmas, A.D. 1979” (1980), based on Giotto frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua, Italy, followed. For the Crumb work, Ms. Dinnerstein spoke from the stage, alerting the audience to what she would be doing inside the piano — plucking, strumming and muting the strings — as well as on the keyboard. The seven brief movements, with titles suggesting Christmas themes, are almost wholly abstract, the final “Carol of the Bells” (no, not  For the most part Ms. Dinnerstein played this music beautifully, especially the Debussy. The Poulenc was needlessly aggressive at times, as in the spiky articulation of the opening, “Bransle de Bourgogne,” and in the haste of the “Petite Marche Militaire.” The second half of the program was both simpler and more complex: Schubert’s towering B flat Sonata, a work Ms. Dinnerstein says in a brief note she “wanted to spend time with.” She certainly did so in the opening movement, which she took with great deliberation but played cleanly. Some of that deliberation might have been better applied to the placid second movement, Andante Sostenuto, which opened with a sort of nervous energy. Then for whatever reasons of technique and memory, the performance foundered in the middle section. Ms. Dinnerstein never seemed to recover her composure entirely after that, forging ahead bravely through the last two movements, but with slips small and large. That first movement held promise of something profound to come, but still a ways down the road.
