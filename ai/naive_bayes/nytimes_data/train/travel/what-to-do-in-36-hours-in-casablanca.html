What to Do in Casablanca
Morocco’s cosmopolitan port beckons with its convivial cafes, colorful markets, waterfront nightclubs and a palm-filled park for a quiet stroll.
===
Marrakesh and Fez bewitch travelers with their ancient customs, and Tangier and Essaouira with their counter-culture exotica, but  1.  Unlike the overflowing mazes in Fez and other Moroccan cities, Casablanca’s central market is small and manageable. White-walled stalls with green clay tile roofs dotted with foliage make for all the Instagrammable backgrounds you’ll ever need. Vendors sell produce, nuts and dates and, in one stand, argan oil, the traditional Moroccan elixir for most everything. Linger long enough and eventually you will see the vendors line up for the call to prayer, and then join them in a quick tagine lunch, served at outdoor tables. 2 Cafes are traditionally the province of Moroccan men, who linger over mint tea and strong coffee. The brightly colored Espace El Frutero juice bar, near the market, is a prime meeting spot for gaggles of young women, friends and students. Fruit and nuts hang from the ceiling in sacks, and you can custom-order a mixed fruit cocktail (about 20 dirhams, about $2.35 at 8.55 dirhams to the dollar). 3.  Completed in 1993 after many years in construction, the Hassan II Mosque is among Africa's largest, with one of the world's tallest minarets to boot. Thanks to its location on the waterfront, and the laser atop the minaret that beams toward Mecca, it’s one of Morocco's most striking buildings. It’s also one of the only mosques that permits non-Muslim visitors into its halls. Take a taxi over at dusk to witness local couples strolling along the shore, snacking on garbanzos sprinkled with salt or fresh potato chips sold in paper cones from pushcarts (12 dirhams) in the mist. The airy plaza in front of the mosque will be dotted with families, the children treating it as a playground, tearing up and down on their scooters. The mosque is an imposing sight but also a welcoming one; ticketed tours are available daily, in several languages, at the entrance. 4.  Sure, Rick’s Cafe is a tourist destination, a pastiche that has nothing to do with the 1942 cinematic classic, which was filmed on a soundstage in California. But it is a lovely pastiche, opened by a former American diplomat, with pristine traditional architecture — arched doorways and mosaic floors — and a Moroccan piano-man, Issam Chabaa, tinkling out medleys of the familiar “As Time Goes By” and Sinatra’s “My Way.” (The movie also plays on a loop around the space.) The waiters in fezzes might be a bit much, but the lighting is sultry, and any hokiness is easily forgotten when you’re cozied up at the bar for a well-mixed Negroni (about 115 dirhams). 5.  The Parc de La Ligue Arabe, the city’s largest green space, sits behind a wide tree-lined boulevard filled with cafes. Its central esplanade, stocked with palms and flowering bushes, provides a respite from the urban traffic and grit. There are kids in colorful jerseys practicing soccer on one end, grandpas playing a lively game of pétanque on the other. The only noise is birds chirping and the thwack of balls. Goodbye, jet lag. 6.  A short stroll from the park is the Villa des Arts, housed in a 1934 Art Deco building — a white one, of course. Black-and-white marble stairs and wrought-iron décor set off exhibits of contemporary paintings and sculpture from Morocco and abroad, in airy rooms. Admission is free, and the museum also hosts regular concerts and readings. For a less institutional setting, there is also a cutting-edge art scene, with occasional exhibits in an old abattoir in a run-down part of town — the Bushwick of Casablanca, with equally adventurous work. 7.  With its sleek look — silver barstools, pendant lights – the Mood Café, in the trendy Quartier Gauthier, could just as easily be in Miami or Los Angeles. Hip young Casablancans congregate with their laptops at the white tables and bright chairs, taking advantage of the free Wi-Fi and the light fare — sandwiches and fresh juices — on the menu. The house salad is a Moroccan take on a chef’s salad, with ham, Brie, corn, olives and walnuts in a creamy dressing; somehow, it works. The restaurant also has a popular brunch special with a smoothie menu, in lieu of a stateside mimosa. Expect to spend about 200 dirhams for lunch or brunch, for two. 8.  The Quartier Gauthier is a high-end shopping strip, with designer furniture stores, galleries, salons and international boutiques like Hugo Boss clustered along Rue Jean Jaurès. Window-shop or spend some dirhams with the well-heeled here; keep an eye out for discounts on hip denim lines, manufactured in Casablanca. Then flaunt your finery at Le Chester’s, a new see-and-be-seen spot for locals and French expats. It’s popular for happy hour or later, loungier outings. Beneath walls lit neon green and decorated with images of Mick Jagger and Stevie Wonder, and with the Jackson 5 and Amy Winehouse on the soundtrack, the clientele smokes and flirts over cheeseburgers. Nonsmoking restaurants are a rarity here; the tablefuls of women dolled up, “Sex and the City"-style, seem right at home. 9.  “This is alcohol-free wine,” the waiter said, pouring me a glass. “In Morocco, alcohol is only for the men, not for the women.” A beat. “That’s a joke!” he exclaimed gleefully. Opened in 1958, the waiter said, the family-owned Al-Mounia restaurant is a Casablanca institution; Jimmy Carter ate there. The veteran staff seems to be having classic fun at every opportunity — “Tourist!” the waiter called out to my dinner companion, pretending he made some dining faux pas. Happily, the traditional menu is livened up and dressed with flourish — the harira soup came with a fat wedge of lemon and a plate of figs; pastilla with a dusting of cinnamon and sugar; effervescently fluffy couscous with carrots and squash and a pot of fragrant broth. Enjoy it under the pepper tree in the courtyard as the servers entertain you. Expect to pay about 400 dirhams for dinner for two. 10.  The strip of clubs and lounges on La Corniche, the waterfront boulevard, lends itself to bar-hopping (especially since they actually serve alcohol). Start at the unpretentious La Calèche, a basement bar hidden down a side street from the Hotel Azur. Bob Marley posters and guitars hang from the ceiling, and the gregarious owner, Albert Cohen, joins jam sessions for an audience of multinational locals; touring musicians often sit in, playing American rock and funk, along with Middle Eastern music, for a mood that is college-level laid-back. For a glossier night, head to Le Cabestan, which could be a restaurant on the French Riviera, and its downstairs neighbor, the flower-filled Rose Bar, overlooking the ocean. In a back room with red velvet banquettes, a crowd can be found dancing, as a D.J. spins a remix of Lykke Li and a medley of David Bowie’s “Let’s Dance” into Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance with Somebody.” Bottles chill in ice buckets and dress codes permit — or encourage — a peek of skin. 11.  In the leafy Quartier Habous neighborhood, near the king’s palace, is Patisserie Bennis Habous, a family-owned Casablancan tradition since 1938. Down a narrow stairwell is its slight retail space, with blue and yellow tile walls and white-coated workers ferrying trays of almond pastries from the ovens across the street. Choose from cornes de gazelles, doigts aux sesame, macaroons and more (50 to 130 dirhams per kilo). 12.  With your snacks, you can wander the streets and nearby square, where there’s a small market for ceramics, babouche slippers and rugs. The handicrafts are not as impressive as those elsewhere in Morocco, but the less frantic environment allows time to bargain and talk — don’t be surprised if a shopkeeper invites you in for a pot of mint tea. And don’t even think of turning him down. Mövenpick Hotel Casablanca Hotel Les Saisons
