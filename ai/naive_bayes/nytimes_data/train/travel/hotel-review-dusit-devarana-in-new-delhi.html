Hotel Review: Dusit Devarana in New Delhi
The hotel, on the outskirts of the city, is meant to be a contemporary interpretation of Indian and Thai sensibilities.

­From 20,000 rupees, or $334, at 60 rupees to the dollar, for a Premium Garden View room including breakfast, free Wi-Fi and a one-way airport transfer. ­The 50-room Dusit Devarana, a Bird Group resort, is the first branch in India of the upscale Thailand-based Dusit chain. The Thai architect Khun Lek Bunnag designed the picturesque eight-acre property that opened last year and is meant to be a contemporary interpretation of Indian and Thai sensibilities. It features a 330-foot-long pool as the centerpiece. ­The two-story Dusit is on the outskirts of  ­The four categories of rooms range from a basic Premium Garden View to the Devarana Pool. They are uniformly 650 square feet and vary in price only because of their location. Because of light occupancy during our visit last December we were upgraded to the Devarana Pool on the ground floor, which has an veranda adjacent to the pool. The room, like the rest of the property, was a design delight with its slightly curved shape and high domed ceiling. The wooden bed contrasted nicely with a long writing desk and floor, both in a cool white marble. A large white soaking tub was near the patio. An iPad controlled everything from lighting to the 42-inch LED television, and we had a butler, a perk offered to all guests, attending to our every need. ­The open layout integrated the bathroom. Two marble sinks were on either side of the room’s entryway and had ample counter space. The toilet area was separated by a door, the oversize shower turned into a steam room with the switch of a button. The luxurious toiletries were from the British brand Asprey. ­There were plenty, including a swimming pool, a bar, a small gym, an Eastern-inspired spa with an outdoor yoga space, a meditation garden, three treatment rooms and a domed temple for prayer that has its own lawn. There is an indoor-outdoor bar, Iah, and the hotel’s flagship restaurant, Kiyan, serving Indian, Western and Thai cuisine from the up-and-coming Indian chef Nishant Choubey. ­Breakfast is available either through room service or at Kiyan, which has indoor and alfresco seating. Given the chilly morning, we opted for an indoor table. Diners can choose from a cold buffet with fresh fruit, cereals and breads as well as made-to-order eggs, pancakes and Indian dishes like dosas. My sister, mother and I went for hot and cold items but waited upward of a half-hour for our omelet and dosas without any explanation for the delay. When they finally did arrive, we got our eggs but no toast, and the dosas came without the standard coconut chutney — both these extras took an additional 10 minutes to arrive. ­With an impressive amount of space, wide range of amenities and appealing design, the Dusit is an easy pick for travelers who want a retreat from the bustle and noise of New Delhi. The drawbacks are its distance from the city center and the inconsistencies in service that shouldn’t exist for a property looking to establish itself as a top contender in the luxury category.
