The Jura Mountains, a Cross-Country Wonderland
Straddling the border of France and Switzerland, the area boasts a network of more than 2,100 miles of groomed cross-country ski trails.
===
Imagine all the cross-country ski trails in New England crammed into an area slightly smaller than New Hampshire. Now, raise the base elevation to a plateau of 3,500 feet. Then bulldoze a 10-foot-wide, perfectly groomed boulevard of a cross-country ski trail from Concord to Berlin, and you’ve got something on par with the Nordic haven that is the Jura. Straddling the border of France and Switzerland, about a 30-minute drive from Geneva, the Jura Mountains offer an interconnected network of more than 2,100 miles of groomed cross-country ski trails. The region has a rustic authenticity that is reflected in its satisfying and hearty cuisine, isolated farmhouses and friendly people, who are among France’s most hospitable. The charm lies in the laid-back way of life up on the “plateau.” It is out of the way, and that’s the point. The artery that runs through the Massif du Jura is a trail more than 100 miles long called the Grande Traversée du Jura, which parallels the arc of the crescent-shaped mountain range. The trail is maintained and groomed through the winter for both classic and skating techniques. Skiing it end to end would make for a vigorous weeklong vacation, but it would take years to ski the almost limitless network of trails branching off it. Situated on the southern edge of the Jura, Giron marks the start (or end) of the trail. It is a popular site because of its excellent snow conditions and proximity to the Rhône Valley and the high-speed train at Bellegarde-sur-Valserine. The dense Champfromier forest, consisting of white pine and spruce, keeps the snow cold enough to extend the season deep into April or May, when other areas are forced to stop grooming or close altogether. The Franche-Comté region, comprising the Jura, Doubs, Haute-Saône and Territoire de Belfort departments, is the second-most-wooded region in France. The emblematic tree of the Jura is the spruce, and Giron features some of the tallest, with 125-foot giants dwarfing passing skiers. Climbing out of Giron, the trail narrows as it heads north. To the left of the ledge lies the Combe d’Evuaz. With its 18th-century school and town buildings, abandoned since the 1920s, this lost corner of an already remote region has the feeling of a ghost town. Tucked into the combe is  Rolling “combes” are characteristic of the Jura, a sequence of accordionlike geologic folds with the most abrupt uplifts on the Swiss border, offering spectacular views of Lake Geneva and the Alps across the Rhône Valley. (Like Mount Washington in New England, Mont Blanc, Europe’s highest peak, serves as a kind of beacon to the surrounding region or at least a much-deserved reward for hikers and skiers cresting ridges and peaks.) For Thomas Magnin-Feysot, a manager at the Parc Naturel Régional du Haut-Jura, a combe is a “narrow depression, or anticline, in the north-south axis of the Haut-Jura mountains,” but more than anything “it’s the feeling one gets from being in the landscape.” These high-altitude valleys, something akin to a hollow, are relatively flat and perfect for “cruising” cross-country skiing. An arduous nine miles from Combe d’Evuaz is a junction perched at 4,229 feet where skiers can enjoy the views and take in a bit of history, too. The Borne au lion, formerly called the Borne des Trois Empires, is a stone marker that used to indicate the borders of France and Spain (which ruled the Franche-Comté region at the time) and the duchy of Savoy before the region became a part of France in 1613. It now separates the Ain and Jura departments. The area was also home to 3,000 resistance fighters in 1943 and 1944, and a new shelter has been built in honor of the top commander, Henri Romans-Petit. Gaze to the right, and you’ll spot the omnipresent Crêt de Chalam, a rock outcropping dominating the landscape at a lofty 5,067 feet. An offshoot of the trail continues on from here, forming a rousing 15-mile loop called the Closettes trail, which climbs farther before an incredibly long downhill drops into Les Moussières. This tiny village is home to an excellent fruitière where Comté cheese, emblematic of the Jura, is made. This broader area is called the Hautes Combes and features some 125 miles of impeccably groomed trails. The other main loop is the Malatrait. Covering eight miles, it rises out of the parking lot in downtown La Pesse past a slope-side bed-and-breakfast,  The trail is groomed daily and is more easygoing in this particular stretch. Build a nice rhythm on the relatively flat terrain past the town of Les Molunes and into Lajoux, and you’ll spot the approaching church and its round, almost onion-shaped bell tower, which is typical of the Jura region. Lajoux is the last town before the climb into the Massacre forest. The Massacre is the highest forest in the Jura, culminating at nearly 5,000 feet (by way of comparison, Mount Washington reaches 6,288 feet), and is sure to have good conditions from November into May. During the exceptional winter of 2012, skiing lasted into June. The high-altitude Tuffes trail, at nearly eight miles, is a favorite loop. The Grande Traversée du Jura then drops down into the resort area Les Rousses, composed of four villages (Lamoura, Prémanon, Les Rousses and Bois-d’Amont) and its nearly 140 miles of trails. This is another bastion of Nordic culture: Prémanon is where France’s top Nordic athletes (including biathlon, cross-country and Nordic combined) train, and every February thousands of athletes huddle in Lamoura in the bitter cold to start the Transjurassienne, a grueling, nearly all-day race. Les Rousses features alpine skiing and a fort-turned-cheese  Beyond Bois-d’Amont lies the Swiss border, which can be crossed, naturally, on skis, before reaching the spectacular Lac de Joux, the Jura’s biggest lake, perched high above sea level. The Dent de Vaulion majestically rises another 1,568 feet above the north end of the 5.6-mile-long lake. Some 88 miles of cross-country trails encircle the lake, including some of the highest in the Jura. Ridge trails link the Col du Marchairuz, a mountain pass, to the 5,509-foot peak of Mont Tendre, which is worth the extra effort for the views of Lake Geneva alone. The Risoux forest starts from the shores of Lac de Joux and extends up to the French border, opposite Mont Tendre, before dropping down into perhaps the densest concentration of Nordic trails in France or continental Europe. Its capital is the tiny village Chapelle-des-Bois — population 263 (as of 2011), but room for 750 guests — and most come for the cross-country skiing. The flagship loops are named after Fabrice Guy and Sylvain Guillaume, two friends who won Nordic combined gold and silver medals, respectively, at the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville. They trained just down the road at the Chaux-Neuve ski-jumping site, which holds a World Cup event every winter and where novices can try their hand at flying through the air on skis. In addition to the roughly 83 miles of trails at Chapelle-des-Bois, the same amount awaits at adjoining areas that can be reached by ski from the village center. This includes Morbier, where you can taste the cheese of the same name, with its layer of ash in the middle. If you become stranded on the trail without an energy bar,  Pushing off from nearby Mouthe (known affectionately as French Siberia) there is an excellent high-altitude loop more than seven miles down the trail called the Seven Chalets as you approach Mont d’Or and Métabief, which is at least as well known for its mountain biking, including hosting the 1993 world championships, as its downhill skiing. Métabief is home to the Jura’s second-biggest alpine ski resort, with a vertical drop of 1,837 feet (which would put it in the Top 20 in New England, on par with Attitash in New Hampshire). But that’s enough about alpine. Visitors would be remiss to go to the Jura and not order the Mont d’Or (or “boîte chaude”), a soft cheese in a circular wooden case that is baked in tin foil with a splash of white wine and garlic until the cheese’s crust caramelizes and becomes crispy. The restaurant  In nearby Les Fourgs, which is just outside Pontarlier, a small city with train service, there are many typically Jurassian moments to experience. The trail network north of the main drag features charming incursions into Switzerland, where the trails cut through farms and have a country-road feeling to them. Toward Verrières-de-Joux, on the upper edge of the map, as the trail starts to lose altitude — and snow —  To the south of the main road in Les Fourgs, it is possible to ski more than 21 miles in one extended loop that features a 4,275-foot peak and one of the most vertiginous descents available on  As with New England, part of the charm of the Franche-Comté region lies in its farmhouses. The windward side of farms, and ­sometimes even churches, are protected from nasty weather by wooden shakes (known as tavaillons) or, nowadays, sheet metal. At the entrance to  During an evening cocktail offered by, and shared with, the hosts, Eric and Viviane Grosfillez, guests experience something of a magic trick. While the guests sit under what appears to be a skylight with a view of the stars, the hosts tug on a rope, and the “glass ceiling'” pivots to reveal a 40-foot chimney lined with spruce boards directly overhead. The sitting area used to be the floor of a  Just about everything in the Jura is inexpensive; expect to pay no more than $75 for half board (lodging, breakfast and dinner, or demi-pension in French) at a comfortable bed-and-breakfast. Boutique hotels have yet to make their way to this corner of the world. Instead, travelers will be put up by people eager to help them experience the region, on skis and off. And, this being France, the food is pretty good, too.
