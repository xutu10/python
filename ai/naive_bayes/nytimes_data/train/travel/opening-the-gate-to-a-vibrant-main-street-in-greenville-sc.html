Opening the Gate to a Vibrant Main Street in Greenville, S.C.
Falls Park became a spark for a pedestrian-friendly city center when it opened in 2004.

Back in 1998, few could have imagined Greenville’s transformation when Mayor Knox White began selling the idea of a park on Main Street incorporating the Reedy River’s 40-foot waterfall. Falls Park became a spark for a pedestrian-friendly city center when it opened in 2004. Last year, the newly ­erected One building — located at 1 Main Street — provided yet another stamp of validation and a new home for high-end retailers to complement an already dense selection of restaurants, cafes and shops. “Main Street was not an attractive destination,” the mayor said. “Today, it’s the most vibrant place in the region.” Vogue meets bohemian in this well-curated boutique. A rotating raft of affordable designer threads (most items are under $100) such as SOLD Design Lab and Yumi Kim fills the racks. A bricks-and-mortar version of the shop’s trunk-show concept, it also carries jewelry and handbags. 122 North Main Street; 864-365-5501;  This French restaurant, opened in June 2013, embodies Greenville’s nouvel esprit. Swinging Parisian jazz is piped through the cozy dining room, which opens onto a patio overlooking Falls Park. Behind a marble bar, the open kitchen serves favorite dishes like garlic-crusted mountain trout, duck confit, and mussels with saffron and espelette peppers. 601 South Main Street; 864-509-0142;  There is more to this basement cafe, a community anchor since 1995, than just beans roasted on site and from-scratch pastries, cakes and pies. The labyrinthine interior — packed with mismatched, overstuffed furniture — hides an Arabian-themed “red room” for cocktails and a theater equipped with church pews for comedy, poetry, acoustic and film nights. 1 East Coffee Street; 864-298-0494;  Greenville is Southern to the bone. And no place speaks Southern as elegantly as Rush Wilson, an Old World men’s shop specializing in polished, tailored fashions like those of the designers Samuelsohn, Coppley and Robert Talbott since 1959. 23 West North Street; 864-232-2761;  At this rooftop wine lounge, opened in April 2013, strings of white lights, wine-barrel cocktail tables, and couches intimately scattered beneath the stars set the mood. Patrons come to taste from a catalog of about 200 wine labels and savor Greenville’s leafy, low-rise skyline. 103 North Main Street; 864-552-1916;
