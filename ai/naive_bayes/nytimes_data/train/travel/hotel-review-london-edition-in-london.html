Hotel Review: London Edition in London
Ian Schrager and Marriott are behind this property, which opened in September 2013. The friendly, unpretentious service and beautiful public spaces make for a standout stay.

­From 252 pounds (about $395, at $1.57 to the pound) ­­Step through the glass cube entryway and into the soaring marble lobby with its frothy belle epoque ceilings, roaring fireplace, leather club chairs and huge chrome egg ceiling sculpture by Ingo Maurer, and you have entered the spectacle that is  ­Conveniently situated in central London, in a landmark Edwardian building in the leafy Fitzrovia neighborhood, just north of busy, shop-lined Oxford Street and a short stroll from Soho and Chinatown. ­Wood-paneled, with a cushy king bed and faux-fur throws that brought to mind a Burt Reynolds magazine centerfold during his heyday. There are 173 rooms, similar in design but priced by size. Because there was availability, the hotel staff gave my husband and me a free upgrade to a deluxe room — at 355 square feet, it wasn’t huge, but it was practically a yacht when compared with the standard room, which measures just 237 square feet. Though comfortable, guest rooms are the least interesting part of the hotel. ­Done up in white mosaic tile, with a sliding wood door and shower fixtures by Grohe. The masculine-scented custom Le Labo bath products are in keeping with the Burt Reynolds vibe. A large mirrored vanity with a shallow porcelain sink is a prominent feature, but there isn’t much counter space; a wood tray and shelf are situated underneath for towels and toiletries. The design is so minimalist as to be impractical — a towel rack by the door is nothing more than a leaning wooden frame. ­The lobby and guest rooms feature works by notable artists including Tracy Emin. The lobby has eclectic, pillow-strewn seating and a black walnut communal work table. Free coffee is served in the mornings. Next door is Berners Tavern, a restaurant and bar by the Michelin-starred chef Jason Atherton. The stunner of a dining room has a spectacularly restored 18-foot stucco ceiling, complete with flowers and cherubim; the walls are jammed with framed pictures, and two enormous bronze chandeliers resembling Fabergé eggs cast the room in golden light. There’s great people-watching, from the bottle-backed bar area to the banquettes outfitted in chestnut mohair and leather. Tucked in the rear of the hotel is the reservations-only Punch Room, an oak-paneled den and cocktail lounge (guests can order customized punch bowls; the in-house version is made with gin, jasmine tea and oak moss). There’s also a subterranean fitness center with the requisite machines and free weights, free wireless Internet and a nightclub. ­A tasty breakfast of avocado on toast with poached eggs and an Americano (£9.25) arrived in a prompt 20 minutes. ­Don’t let the scenesters in the lobby put you off. The friendly, unpretentious service and beautiful public spaces make for a standout stay.
