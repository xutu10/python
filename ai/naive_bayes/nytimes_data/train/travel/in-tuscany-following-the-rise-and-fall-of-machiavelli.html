In Tuscany, Following the Rise and Fall of Machiavelli
Five centuries after “The Prince” was written, visiting spots in and around Florence that track the arc of Machiavelli’s life.
===
The medieval hamlet of Sant’Andrea in Percussina sits in the Tuscan hills amid rose-covered stone farmhouses and small country chapels surrounded by acres of silver-green olive groves. Farmers drive Apes, the tiny three-wheeled farm vehicles favored by pensioners here, piled high with fruit and vegetables from their land, while the scent of grapes fermenting for local Chianti wine, one of the town’s main productions, wafts from underground barrel-vaulted cantinas. But despite having the feeling of being in a faraway enclave, from a bench in the corner of one of those village gardens, I can see the rooftops of Florence in the distance, even making out the familiar dome of the city’s cathedral, glinting in the early summer sun. While it seems an idyllic spot today, it was here that five centuries ago the political philosopher and statesman Niccolò Machiavelli, considered by many the architect of modern politics, spent more than a decade in exile. He used to sit on this very perch, in a corner of his garden, pining for his former city home — in view but just out of reach. Machiavelli was born in Florence in 1469, and, for most of his career in government, his fortunes rose and fell in inverse proportion to those of the Medicis, the Florentine family that came to power in the Renaissance and was the source of many of its artistic treasures. A chancellor for the city while the Medicis had been in exile themselves, Machiavelli took part in a failed attempt to stop them from returning to power, for which he’d ended up jailed, tortured and finally banished to this family farm. But while it was punishment, to be sure, to be abruptly removed from his government seat to this secluded village, it also proved a particularly productive period for him, during which he wrote his magnum opus, “The Prince,” in just under a year. But even as Machiavelli was creating his masterpiece, he had fears it would be misinterpreted, seen by the court as less a letter of forgiveness to the Medicis than a master plan for Machiavelli and other ambitious types to orchestrate their own takeovers. After “The Prince” was written in 1513, his fears were almost immediately realized, the treatise was quickly vilified, and Machiavelli labeled “an agent of the devil.” Now, however, just before the 500th anniversary of the presentation of “The Prince” to the Medicis in Florence, theorists and political scientists not only believe that in parts it was indeed misread, but also that it, in fact, marks the starting point for modern politics, serving as a highly persuasive treatise on diplomacy and the behind-the-scenes maneuvering required to curry favor in an ever-changing political landscape. “One must be a fox in order to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten off wolves” — it was just this sort of pragmatic thought that has made him so important across the centuries. Leaders from John Adams to Bill Clinton have been influenced by Machiavelli, reciting from his work or studying his texts to put in context their own political times. Not least of whom is Matteo Renzi, the brash and charismatic 39-year-old who became Italy’s prime minister in February, and is often described as Machiavellian by both local and international journalists. In a very particular machination of Italian politics (and a move Machiavelli might have related to), Mr. Renzi ascended to power after a close election that resulted in a divided parliament that failed to produce a consensus candidate for prime minister, and the typically ceremonial president drew upon his constitutional powers to name a new prime minister instead of calling for new elections. The comparison to Machiavelli is something that Mr. Renzi doesn’t seem to mind, and may even relish; he even cut the ribbon to kick off the events of the yearlong celebration of the philosopher that included readings of “The Prince” and a presentation of his play “La Mandragola” (“The Mandrake”) at the Teatro Goldoni in Florence, guided tours of Machiavelli’s office in the Palazzo Vecchio, and an exhibit at the city’s National Central Library. In fact it was Mr. Renzi’s affinity for the philosopher that really piqued my interest in pondering Machiavelli’s Florence today. As you stand in the entryway of the Palazzo Vecchio, it’s difficult even to move inside the main building, so compelling the courtyards with their gorgeous lunettes, frescoes by Giorgio Vasari among others, and replica of the adorable fountain of a winged angel with a dolphin sculpted by Andrea del Verrocchio that is now on the museum’s second floor. I had come to this former home of Cosimo I de’ Medici many times before, but this time I was on the hunt for Machiavelli’s office as part of a desire to understand his rise and fall, and rise again. His slim “Prince” had remained in my mind ever since I first read it in high school, its hold on me growing stronger after I read it again in a contemporary civilization course at Columbia, where I came to appreciate it as a supreme example of a sublimely succinct, and beautifully crafted, polemic. Five hundred years later, the sites that offer clues to the life of the writer continue to be among the most vital, not to mention artistically exquisite, in the city. Even today the Palazzo Vecchio remains the civic heart of the Florentine government (briefly, in the 19th century, Florence was the capital of Italy): People still pick up business licenses at the commune office, or get married in its “Red Room,” while the city’s mayor meets with the town council in the marvelous Hall of 500, also with frescoes by Vasari. It’s here that I met my Florentine guide, Silvia Ponticelli. We made our way through the palazzo to the top floor of the old Chancellery, a tucked-away dark wood-paneled space where Machiavelli spent almost two decades signing edicts and accruing influence with the interim regime. It was hard not to be jealous that this was where he came to work each day, and I imagined him stopping by some of the palazzo’s treasures as he made his way through the building. Ms. Ponticelli and I marveled at the fact that the beautiful building (except the private offices) remains completely open to the general public, despite the exquisite details of the structure and fragile art it contains. She told me that when Mr. Renzi was mayor — a position he served in for five years here — he removed the metal detectors from the palazzo’s entrance. “He said Florentines deserved to come into his office, and that the mayor was the same as any of them,” Ms. Ponticelli told me. It was a symbolic gesture that Machiavelli would have appreciated, making me think of his line “He who becomes a Prince through the favor of the people should always keep on good terms with them; which it is easy for him to do, since all they ask is not to be oppressed.” “The modernity of his thought is what is most interesting to me,” Ms. Ponticelli explained. “Machiavelli learned from the history of things and then adapted them to the present. He had a large sense of civic consideration and personal responsibility combined with a sense of what served the greater good of the people. But, of course, it was a time of city-states and violence, so one has to look at his talk of force within that context.” Near the Palazzo Vecchio, the imposing white-marble-fronted Basilica of Santa Croce glinted in the late summer sun. This church was once the sanctuary for Florence’s displaced, and remains one of the most important Franciscan structures in Italy, the religious counterpoint to the Palazzo Vecchio. It is also a burial ground where Florence’s most famous personalities are memorialized. Not only is there an empty tomb for Dante (who was also in exile at the time of his death and whose actual ashes lie in Ravenna), but Michelangelo and Galileo, as well as Machiavelli are interred there. An epitaph on Machiavelli’s tomb reads, “Tanto nomini nullum par elgoium (“There is no eulogy to befit so great a name”), which is more than a little surprising, given that he was a political pariah, an atheist, and banned from entering the building during the last years of his life. He was originally buried in the churchyard outside, but by the 1700s Florence’s citizens had recognized Machiavelli’s brilliance and brought him inside to be near their other great minds. “It’s a cultural pantheon: literature, art, science and politics,” Ms. Ponticelli said. But it is also a monument to Florence’s ability to embrace and restore reputations of its fallen men. Not all of Machiavelli’s haunts are as well visited as Palazzo Vecchio and Santa Croce. He used to walk in the nearby Oricellari Gardens (open by appointment), when the Medicis allowed him to return briefly to his beloved Florence — in fact, Machiavelli died in the city, in a spot marked by plaques, at 18 via de Guicciardini, between the Ponte Vecchio and the Pitti Palace. I was alone as I wandered through the landscaped pathways and past the hulking statue of the Cyclops, Polyphemus, caught in a bacchanal pose just hours before Odysseus blinds him and escapes his lair. I wondered whether to Machiavelli it was a particularly satisfying tale, the much more powerful creature ultimately brought down by the machinations of a crafty thinker. “Everyone sees what you appear to be, few experience what you really are,” Machiavelli wrote in “The Prince.” And indeed it was only upon touring the antique stone village where Machiavelli lived and wrote during the years of his exile that I best came to understand the man, especially because of the excellent guided tour that the house museum there offers. The bust of Machiavelli in the Palazzo Vecchio is a relief thought to be taken from his death mask. It shows a rather brooding face, a thin-lipped and sharp-boned figure. In fact I had imagined before my visit to his hamlet that he was a man of few passions besides work and politics. But on my tour I learned how he was a man of huge appetites: In addition to his own seven legitimate children, he managed to be something of a Tuscan Casanova, enjoying women all over Italy, and he drank copiously, too: “After dinner, I go back to the inn: here are the innkeeper, and usually a butcher, a miller, and two bricklayers. In their company I roguify myself all day,” he wrote. After the reveling, back in his study at a heavy desk much like the one in Palazzo Vecchio, he would spend the evening on the work that would come to define him. “For four hours,” he wrote, “I feel no boredom, I forget every worry, I don’t dread poverty, nor has death any terrors for me.” At Albergaccio, the inn where Machiavelli once caroused, I sat under the barreled ceiling for wine and a hearty lunch of pici with wild boar sauce. Earlier in the tour the guide explained that there was still a secret tunnel underground that led between his home and the tavern. “He was scared that perhaps the Medicis would assassinate him so it was an emergency exit, but it was also a way to get to the inn or local women without his wife noticing.” It made me giggle to think how his cunning mind could be applied to both lofty political thought and randy desires. But such was the dichotomy between Machiavelli the writer and civil servant, and Machiavelli the lover and farmer exiled in the countryside.
