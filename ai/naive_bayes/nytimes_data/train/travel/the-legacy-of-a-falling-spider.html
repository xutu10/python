The Legacy of a Falling Spider
A trip to Africa after ninth grade helped the Frugal Traveler cultivate a skill that would prove professionally useful years later.

One of my frugal trademarks is being willing to sleep just about anywhere. A Chinese hotel stinking of cigarettes with a mattress as soft as quarried granite, a jail-cell-size Guatemalan room with filthy walls  Well, maybe not good, but it could be worse. Big hairy spiders could be dropping from above. I would know. In 1985, I spent the summer after ninth grade on an exchange trip to  The village, Bulemia — yes, that was the name — was a farming community not far from the Ugandan border and Lake Victoria. There were a few shops along the main (really only) road, and clusters of thatched-roof homes of extended families. Though my photos show some sort of cables running down the main street, the homes had no electricity, no running water and no phones. (Cellphones were a long way off.) Our only connection was by battery-powered radios, which piped in news from Nairobi, ads for antimalarials and Western music, which that summer included  In Bulemia, we were broken into pairs and sent out to live with farming families. My roommate was Brian Eames, a soccer player from Atlanta, and we were thrilled with our placement in a cluster of modest but beautiful thatched-roof mud homes. We adored our well-educated, English-speaking hosts Patrick and Joseph, and spent days discussing modernity versus tradition, especially women’s rights — unavoidable in this land of polygamy and dowries. It was not lost on us that women in the family didn’t join our discussions — they only appeared with bowls of hot water for us to wash our hands before meals. We slept in individual, Western-style beds, and made the short walk to town, through thriving cassava fields and over lush green hills, to do a work project with the other Americans and play soccer with local schoolchildren. (We were also pathetic brats, of course. We were “suffering” from meals of stewed chicken, cassava, collard greens and the like, says an entry in my journal, which relates how our group “sat around arguing about McDonald’s versus Burger King, etc. We’re getting kind of desperate for real food.”) Then, halfway through our two-week stay, we were moved to another family’s home, much farther from town. Our sleeping quarters were no longer two beds in a comfortable traditional home but a single cot in a rather ramshackle rectangular house with a rusting tin roof. The home buzzed with wasps and flies and featured a picture of the former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin on the wall. We arrived for lunch, and sat down with our new — and much less talkative — host, Charles. I was sitting across from Brian, glumly eating the cornmeal porridge called ugali when I saw something fall from the ceiling onto Brian’s head. He thought it was a drop of water, or maybe a fly, and tried to brush it off with its hand. A hairy spider bigger than any I had ever seen in real life landed on his T-shirt, and began skittering up toward his face on creepy, articulated legs. I gaped and, though speechless, managed to point at his chest. Brian looked down, and, jumped up and reflexively swatted it away. It landed on the floor and began crawling away. As our adrenaline spiked, Charles calmly stood up, gave it a stomp, and tossed the carcass out of the house. Then he looked at us and started howling with laughter. Our pale faces — even paler than before, of course — were apparently the funniest thing he had ever seen. We never found out what kind of spider it was, or whether it was poisonous. But the house gained a nickname: Amityville. And that night, as we awkwardly crammed into the tiny cot, neither of us slept much. We were not used to sharing beds, let alone tiny ones with poisonous(?) tarantulas(?) creeping overhead. No spiders dropped, and we got used to the flies and wasps. A couple of nights later we figured out that we could put the cot’s thin mattress on the floor for one of us, while the other slept on the metal frame covered with a blanket. Clichéd though it may be, the trip did change my life in some ways. I no longer fought my brother for the sports section of the newspaper, instead flipping through the international pages in search of news from Africa. My college thesis was about independence movements in French West Africa. But the trip’s greatest legacy was my ability to sleep just about anywhere. What about Brian? In his note in my journal, he had signed off “Remember Amityville” and drawn a “BEWARE: FALLING SPIDER ZONE” sign. But had there been any lasting impact? He is now  Did spiders appear in his books in any way, I asked? He paused, and I could almost hear his eyes widen over the phone. “Wait, there’s a nasty bad guy named Spider!” he said, “Well, really the nasty sidekick of the main bad guy. He has a big articulated spider tattooed over one eye.” He laughed. “Feel free to exaggerate the psychological connection, if you want,” he said. I don’t think that will be necessary.
