36 Hours in Berkeley, Calif.
Go for an idyllic campus stroll, take in wide-open panoramas, sample international flavors and catch some culture during a weekend in this Bay Area college town.
===
More than four decades ago, Alice Waters, a pioneer of farm-fresh California cuisine, opened Chez Panisse in a jewel-box Craftsman-style building just north of downtown Berkeley. Other outstanding food purveyors followed, but this being a university town, Berkeley’s culinary landscape remained heavily colonized by frozen yogurt vendors and cheap burrito and ramen joints. But a recent spate of openings, from a shochu-focused Japanese tavern to a modern Mexican restaurant serving tlayuda and house-made sangrita al fresco, have filled in the gaps, expanding and elevating the dining options available in newly stylish pockets of downtown. They’re all worthy, grown-up stops to pepper a weekend spent exploring this vibrant college community, rich as ever with music, independent bookstores and cafe culture. Rest assured that the hippie spirit is alive and well in the barefoot buskers and longhaired denizens biking through town. 1. Canopy to Campanile |  No visit to Berkeley is complete without an idyllic stroll under the canopy of old-growth oaks, redwoods and 200-foot eucalyptus  2.  A half-block from the eucalyptus grove, step off the student-clogged stretch of Center Street and through the black-and-white curtains at Ippuku, where a top-notch selection of sake, shochu and craft beer anchors the front bar, and a deep menu of Japanese small plates can keep you occupied for hours. The long, skinny dining room is a warren of intimate, curtained booths for two and larger, wood-screened tables, ideal for groups, where you remove your shoes. The warm staff is happy to introduce novices to the savory pleasures of casual izakaya-style dining: chicken gizzard skewers, bacon-wrapped mochi, corn fritters, soft-cooked eggs in dashi broth. Three preparations of fresh handmade soba are available on Monday and Tuesday nights. Try the refreshing shochu cocktails made with grapefruit and umeboshi plum. 3.  John Paluska has an interesting pedigree for a restaurateur: For 17 years, he was the manager for the band Phish. He brings Matt Gandin, former chef of San Francisco’s beloved Delfina, into the mix for his latest project, Comal, an upscale Mexican restaurant and cocktail bar with an emphasis on Oaxacan-inspired cuisine: white shrimp ceviche, rock cod tacos with spicy pickled cabbage, spit-roasted whole chicken served family-style with black beans, achiote rice. Rich mole sauces and three kinds of salsa are frequent accompaniments. At the wood-clad bar at the rear of the long, high-ceilinged industrial space, cocktails are expertly prepared with a bit of theater (lots of vigorous two-handed shaking), and they are fierce (the Jack Satan cocktail is made with “infierno tincture,” as well as tequila, hibiscus syrup, lime and salt). On busy nights, a cocktail and chips cart goes around the open-air back patio, ferrying margaritas and guacamole to grateful patrons waiting to be seated. The music is always good. 4. ­Stair Masters | 10 a.m. In the early 20th century, the hill areas of Berkeley were just starting to be developed. The challenge of building streets along contoured land made for long, winding blocks, and pathways sprang up to offer shortcuts between them. These days, there is an extensive system of 136 pedestrian paths, historic staircases and walkways, each assigned official names and numbers by the city. They include greenways, bike paths and leafy, meandering steps up to parks, gardens, trails and rock-climbing areas; for example, the 183 concrete steps up Tamalpais Path lead past a waterfall and fern grotto to a redwood-framed view of Mount Tamalpais itself. The Berkeley Path Wanderers Association puts out a terrific map of all the secret routes and corridors; pick up a copy and set out on your own, or sign up for one of the group’s regular guided walks. 5. ­Cheesy Music Fix | 11:30 a.m. The Cheese Board Collective has been a worker-owned-and-operated business since 1971. It has expanded from a cheese shop to include a bakery, espresso bar and an inventive pizzeria that turns out a different kind of pie every day (check the website for the week’s menu; one recent offering featured corn, pasilla pepper, onion, mozzarella, feta, garlic olive oil, cilantro and lime). Be sure to check in at the cheese counter — there is a rotating selection of 300 to 400 cheeses you can taste — before heading next door to the pizzeria for lunch and live music. 6. ­View From the Top | 2 p.m. One of the most magnificent views of San Francisco Bay can be found at the Lawrence Hall of Science, the university’s public science museum and educational research center, just a five-minute drive uphill from the main campus. Take a walk around the expansive pedestrian plaza for a look at the shifting panorama of San Francisco and its bridges (for a preview of the foggy-one-minute-sunny-the-next local weather, visit the museum’s continuously updated 24-hour time-lapse feed). The intimate planetarium, hands-on exhibits and friendly staff are wonderful for kids, and the outdoor sculpture garden, perfect for picnics, has telescopes facing the bay. A few minutes farther up the road is Tilden Regional Park; its 2,000-plus acres are crisscrossed with hiking trails and include a botanical garden and showcase farm. 7. Opened in May by two Brooklyn transplants, Christopher Clarke and Lauren Brody-Clarke, La Botella Republic is a rustic, intimate 33-seat wine bar and bottle shop with a focus on Northern California wines and beers. The well-curated list is best sampled in flights, which change frequently; a recent board spotlighted small producers of rich, fruit-forward cabernet sauvignon (Broadside) and syrah (Ledge Vineyards) 8. ­Culture Clubs | 8 p.m. Berkeley’s downtown arts district has serious street cred. It’s home to the Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse, which has hosted such folk and bluegrass luminaries as Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, David Grisman, Alison Krauss and Dar Williams since its founding in 1968. Fully renovated five years ago, the Freight is a terrific venue to listen to a full range of live traditional music, both well-known (Mary Chapin Carpenter is scheduled to perform on Oct. 15) and not (all are welcome at open-mike night). Across the street, the Tony Award-winning Berkeley Repertory Theater was also founded at the height of the '60s counterculture; it recently premiered works by Lemony Snicket and David Henry Hwang, and continues to put on plays that tour the world. 9. ­A Star Is Reborn | 10 p.m. If you haven’t made a reservation, late night at Chez Panisse Cafe is a good time for walk-ins. After a devastating fire last year, the legendary restaurant reopened with a face-lift, but everything from the remodeled porch and spiffed-up new facade to the cutout copper lamps is still true to the Craftsman spirit of the original. And the service is as pitch-perfect as always — friendly but not overly solicitous, attentive but not fawning — each member of the staff attuned to a clientele that may arrive in formal attire or flip-flops. A recent cafe dinner menu included corn and goat cheese pudding soufflé, skirt steak with borlotti beans, and a nectarine galette that tasted just like summer. 10. ­Hit the Books | 10 a.m. Do your college student thing this morning and hit up Alchemy Collective Cafe for powerful espresso drinks and a caffeinated crowd strongly represented by the punky, inked and pierced. Then, properly woken up, head a mile and a half away to the cheerful, sunlit Mrs. Dalloway’s bookshop for a morning browsing its well-curated stacks. Its co-owners, Ann Leyhe and Marion Abbott, have had long careers in book publishing, and their passion and knowledge come through in thoughtful displays and recommendations of everything from children’s books to new fiction. Finish up the visit with breakfast sandwiches and elegant pastries next door at the Elmwood Cafe.
