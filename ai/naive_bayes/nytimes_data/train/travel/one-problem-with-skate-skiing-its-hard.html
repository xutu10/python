‘One Problem With Skate Skiing: It’s Hard’
I always thought “classic” Nordic-style cross-country skiing was boring. So I tried its zippy younger brother. Here’s how that went.
===
­For a long time I just didn’t “get” cross-country skiing. Shuffling through the woods while dangling a scratchy wool scarf? Too stuffy, too twee, too  Then a friend introduced me to skate skiing, “classic” Nordic’s zippy younger brother. If traditional Nordic skiing is a walk in the woods, then skate skiing — which was born only in the 1970s — is more like trail running. It’s swooping. It’s fast. It’s graceful. It’s even a bit sexy, something its buttoned-up older brother has never been accused of. No wonder that more runners and cyclists have discovered the discipline as a great winter counterpart. Purchase of skate skis has been on a slow, steady rise in recent years, accounting for 16 percent of cross-country skis bought in 2012-13. There’s just one problem with skate skiing: It’s hard. While anyone can hop on old-school Nordic skis and at least poke around the forest, big lungs are hugely helpful in skate skiing — yet even more important is good technique. I tried to teach myself, bulling my way to proficiency. It didn’t work. On the trail, women in their 70s would chirp, “Good morning!” as they skated effortlessly past my gasping, lathered frame. I needed help. I smelled redemption last fall in the form of XC Supercamp. For 27 years Silver Star Mountain Resort and adjacent Sovereign Lake Nordic Center in south-central  Silver Star and Sovereign Lake, which sit above the city of Vernon and the wine-growing Okanagan Valley, share a reputation among hard-core Nordic skiers as perhaps the top early-season training ground in North America. National teams from around the world descend on the groomed trails that wend through tall firs here to practice before the World Cup season begins; in the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games athletes who’d trained here in the weeks before the Games went on to win 18 medals. What’s so special about the place? In a word, snow. The 70 miles of well-groomed trails sit at elevations of up to 6,240 feet in Silver Star Provincial Park; snow is so reliable here that much of the network usually opens by the second week of November. (Though the ski area gets about 275 inches of snow annually, trails can open with as little as eight inches of snow coverage). It’s the largest daily-groomed trail network in Canada. Determined to learn how to skate correctly, I signed up as a beginner in a short camp over the last Thanksgiving holiday. The trails were in great shape when I arrived; every mile was already open, with two grooming machines out nightly. “It’s corduroy bow to stern,” Guy Paulsen, Silver Star’s Nordic manager and co-director of the camps, said of the buffed trails when we met. Before camp began Friday afternoon I wandered around to get oriented. Silver Star’s base village was like no place I’d visited. Thanks to geography the village sits halfway up the ski slopes, its one street short enough to hold a 100-yard dash. Victorian-style buildings painted in primary colors and with wooden porches lined snow-covered Main Street — an Old West boomtown as imagined by Mondrian. The street simply stopped where the skiing began. As light snow sifted down, the compact scene resembled one captured in a snow globe. Yet something was off. Finally I figured it out: Even though it was opening day for the ski hill, I saw almost no skiers; the ski racks outside the bakery were filled with Nordic skis, not snowboards. Posters advertised a coming loppet, or long cross-country ski event, the way other towns might advertise a band coming to town. Snowy Main Street had been set with a ski track, and now Nordic skiers were snapping into their skis at the edge of the parking lot and shuffling down the main drag. I stopped a greyhound-thin man before he revved up. “You can ski right out onto the trails from here?” “Oh, yeah. Right up there,” he said, pointing to where the track crossed a ski slope and disappeared into the woods. “This is the best there is.” With that he accelerated toward the forest. I started to understand: Good snow alone didn’t bring people to this mountaintop; the culture did. Nordic skiing wasn’t an afterthought here, unlike at almost every other ski resort in North America. Here it was front and center. Here it was cool to be on skinny skis. Forty people, from California to Australia, had signed up for the week’s camps, and after lunch Mr. Paulsen took my group of four beginners out to the Grid, a flat field. Mr. Paulsen is a patient man with a droopy mustache and a playful style. (Though he never mentioned it, he also was a recent inductee to the Canadian Ski Instructors’ Alliance Hall of Fame.) He soon had us performing basic drills to get us comfortable on skate skis. You want a nice traditional “athletic stance,” Mr. Paulsen told us first — a comfortable bend at the knees, your weight atop the balls of the feet. Now add a little more bend at the ankles. Imagine shrinking in stature a little bit. “How tall are you?” he asked me. “Six-foot-1.” “I’m 6-1,” he replied. On skate skis, he said, “I try to be 5-11.” In traditional Nordic skiing, skiers drive forward in a linear kick-then-glide motion. Skate skiing, by contrast, is more like ice skating: It’s a V-stride in which a skier pushes off with the edge of one angled ski and shifts his body weight to the other ski, driving forward, then reversing the process — and, with luck, gliding down the trail. As a result the skis are several inches shorter, lighter and shaped differently; the boots have more ankle support; and the poles are longer. Skate skiing also isn’t done in set tracks like its cousin but on smooth, manicured (and usually flat to moderately hilly) terrain. Now we worked on shifting our weight back and forth from one ski to another. Here came Tip No. 2: When you push off from one ski onto another, think “nose over knees over toes,” Mr. Paulsen said — a position called being “stacked.” When you’re centered like this, the ski can glide nicely instead of digging in, he explained. Learning how to efficiently glide is key as a skate skier. “The push is good,” Mr. Paulsen told us. “But the glide is better.” “The big-timers who come out there, it’s just refinement of all this,” he told us. “Now, let’s get our poles and hit the trails and get a scenery change.” We skidded behind him onto the green (easiest) trails, a pack of wobbly puppies, until we reached a forgivingly wide, flat piece of trail. The arms, and use of the poles, are the second half of a skier’s engine. “We’re going to get into the world of different poling techniques,” Mr. Paulsen said. “There are about five of them.” Mr. Paulsen first showed us “two skate” (which Americans call “V2”), or a technique of planting both ski poles on every other push. It’s the most common, most useful poling technique. We skied back and forth, practicing. “Not so big,” he corrected, after I threw my arms out in front of me and pulled hard on them like a sailor desperately hoisting anchor. “That’s why you burn yourself out.” Keep your elbows in close, arms and hands about shoulder-width apart, he directed. “Think Tyrannosaurus, not Frankenstein.” Mr. Paulsen was doing exactly what I’d hoped: tearing apart all of my bad habits like a swing coach deconstructing a duffer’s snap hook. Still, it was humbling. “You’re supposed to smile when you do it,” a fellow camper said to my furrowed brow he skied past. After skiing, I attended an informative talk about how to train by a local professor and former Canadian national team Nordic skier. And this leads to my only real criticism of Supercamp: A fellow camper and I agreed that the camp was so casual in its approach that it could undermine its strengths, as when I missed a talk by a national-caliber ski-waxing expert because no one made an announcement, and I received no detailed itinerary. On Day 2, James Cunningham, a tall, dark, understated Canadian who until recently was the director of athlete development for Cross Country Canada, took over as instructor. On the Grid, Mr. Cunningham had us get the feel of shifting our weight by putting aside our poles and skiing up and down the field swinging arms over the opposite ski tip. Arms lifting in unison, rocking gently, we could have been an Esther Williams routine. Out on the trails again Mr. Cunningham introduced us to yet another poling technique, this one for climbing, called “offset.” “So we’ve got a couple of things going on here,” he said gently, as we made a hash of his instructions — no one more so than me. I struggled with it until Mr. Cunningham skied up the hill next to me. Suddenly, it clicked. “You’ve got it,” he said. Those small eurekas gave outsize satisfaction — perhaps because, once learned, I knew I’d never forget them. That afternoon while some other campers continued their lessons (the camps offer a great deal on all-day lessons, something I wish I’d taken advantage of) I headed out solo on trails toward the distant Alder Point Lookout. Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir soon closed in around me. I would like to say that, armed with a few short lessons, I glided at bicycle speeds into the wilderness, a skier transformed. I did not. Skate skiing gives up its beauty grudgingly. It is hard work, trying artfully to balance nearly 200 pounds on a strip of slippery wood narrower than a piece of crown molding while gripping poles that are the perfect length to self-administer nose­bleeds. What’s more, to the novice skate skier every modest rise in the earth is a Matterhorn, every knoll an Ararat. As the green trail gently climbed, I unzipped, then stripped. I slowed down and reduced expectations. Soon it was good enough just to be alone in the mountains with the squeak of snow underfoot, and the tom-tom of heart in ears, and a ridge away the sound of a machine grooming the trail for me, and to my back the sight of the Monashee Mountains quietly disrobing their storm clothes. It occurred to me that skate skiing was akin to visiting the chiropractor: There always was more work to be done. It was never over. Tomorrow in the fairy-tale woods of Sovereign Lake I would get a little better — not much, but a little. And most important, I would want to keep at it. That distant lookout would wait for another day, a better me. Finally, though, I was on my way.
