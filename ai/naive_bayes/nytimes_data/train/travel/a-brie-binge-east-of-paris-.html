A Brie Binge East of Paris  
On a trip to the Seine-et-Marne region, where Brie has been produced since the seventh century, the author goes on an indulgent cheese tasting tour.
===
Two summers ago, in a village outside Coulommiers, an old market town an hour east of Paris, an old love affair of mine came back to life. On my way to a borrowed house for a few weeks, my partner, Bruno, and I had stopped at a farm for eggs, cream and produce — including a Coulommiers cheese in a round wooden box. I lifted the lid and poked it; it yielded easily to the touch. When we ended a barbecue under the walnut tree in the garden that night, this locally made raw-milk beauty — runny and pleasantly tangy with a suave, complex taste of mossy wells and toasted hazelnuts — shot me back through time to a snowy Saturday in Connecticut when I was 11. Those were the days when the cheese we American suburbanites ate was pretty much limited to the dull trio of industrial “Swiss,” Cheddar and Monterey Jack, so the cheese shop that opened that day in our small town caused a stir. My father took us for a visit, and though the ripe olfactory punch that greeted us when we opened the door made us laugh, it turned out I had already acquired a fledgling taste for strong, funky cheese from my paternal grandmother: She served Liederkranz — a runny and pungent cheese made in Ohio, inspired by German Limburger cheese — as an hors d’oeuvre before Sunday lunch, and I loved it. The friendly shop owner offered us tiny tastes of various cheeses, and my father ended up buying three of them: a whole Coulommiers, a wedge of Brie and a L’Explorateur, a stunningly rich “triple-crème” cheese with a gold-foil label depicting a rocket ship taking off. (I was fascinated by the fanciful drawing, though no one could explain the connection between the rocket and the cheese.) The all-cheese lunch we had when we got home began an obsession with French dairy that was a major reason I moved to Paris years later. I hadn’t eaten a really good Coulommiers in a long time before that summer supper in the garden, though; few Paris restaurants still serve a cheese tray, and our own cheese buying is mostly limited to the basics. But the Coulommiers was as good as I had remembered, and we made fast work of it. So the next day, I went to La Ferme Jehan de Brie, an excellent fromagerie in the town of Coulommiers, for more. After I had chosen my cheese, the friendly shop owner asked if I wanted anything else. I told her I was interested only in locally produced varieties, and she suggested a wedge of Brie de Meaux and a superb triple-crème Gratte-Paille. While she wrapped the cheeses in waxed white paper, I stared at a small map of the immediate region, the Seine-et-Marne département, taped to the wall; it brought to mind a cheese-themed itinerary through what has traditionally been one of the greatest dairy-producing regions of  So last year, Bruno and I returned to the Seine-et-Marne to undertake a two-day-long crawl to taste of some of France’s greatest cheeses at their source. After leaving Paris on a cold, sunny morning, we shed the city’s suburbs after 45 minutes, and crossed the vast, misty green fields that dominate the Seine-et-Marne before arriving in the town of Jouarre. ­ We began our quest at La Fromagerie Ganot, a cheese shop and affineur (cheese ager). The family-run business also houses a small museum devoted to the history and production of Brie and other Seine-et-Marne cheeses, part of a guided visit that also includes a video show with live commentary, a visit to the aging cellars and a tasting. Isabelle Hédin, whose grandfather founded the fromagerie in 1895, told us that there are six varieties of Brie, and that the final taste of the cheese depends on the size of the mold used to contain the coagulated raw cows’ milk curd and the length of time it ages. “Brie-style cheeses are produced all over the world,” Ms. Hédin said. “But real Brie only comes from the Seine-et-Marne.” She said that only two types of Brie have an A.O.C., or Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée, a government label indicating that they have been produced according to a strict set of rules: Brie de Meaux and Brie de Melun, both of which are named after towns in the Seine-et-Marne. “Brie de Meaux has a velvety white rind, and tastes of butter and hazelnuts after six to eight weeks of aging,” Ms. Hédin said. Brie de Melun “is best between 10 and 12 weeks, and it has a stronger, saltier, more robust flavor that’s a little yogurt-y.” And what of Coulommiers, the cheese that inspired this trip? It is part of the Brie family, she explained, “and is distinguished from Brie by being smaller and thicker, with a rounder, sweeter taste.” Brie has been produced in the Seine-et-Marne since the seventh century and is said to have been a favorite of both the emperor Charlemagne and King Henry IV. At the closing banquet of the Congress of Vienna on June 9, 1815, where some 60 different European cheeses were served, Brie de Meaux was voted “the King of Cheeses” by the assembled diplomats and nobles. This notoriety notwithstanding, Ms. Hédin said cheese production in the region had declined, as farmers convert from livestock to more profitable crops. “Today they’re fewer than a dozen farms making cheese with raw milk they produce themselves,” she said. “Most French Brie is produced with pasteurized milk, so it never achieves any depth of flavor, because the natural bacteria that ripen it are no longer present. Brie de Meaux and Brie de Melun can only be made with milk that’s produced in the Seine-et-Marne, however.” In the aging cellars, Ms. Hédin advised us to always eat “la croute fleuri,” the white crust of the Brie, which develops when penicillium mold grows on it after its been rubbed with salt, because “it has a lot of flavor, and it’s good for you!” She was right, of course; the rind concentrates the flavor of the cheese. We followed that with a fine Brie de Meaux; another Brie that was seasoned with a fine layer of mustard seeds and which called out for a nice slice of ham; and some Brie noir, a year-old cheese with a crumbly crust. It had a curiously gummy but not unpleasant texture and tasted faintly of the thick caramel it resembled. “In the past, we ate Brie noir for breakfast,” Ms. Hédin said. “You’d cut a little piece and dip it into your coffee.” ­ The friends whose country house we had borrowed recommended their favorite inn as an overnight spot. So after a 15-minute drive in a squall, we arrived at the Auberge de la Source in the hamlet of St.-Ouen-sur-Morin. It was postcard-pretty and just the type of place you dream of finding in the French countryside, an old-fashioned inn with modern comforts, charming hospitality and simple, delicious food. We shared an enormous grilled veal chop with mushroom cream sauce and an assortment of three excellent Bries, from Meaux, Melun and Provins. As we chatted with Laurent Tizio, the amiable owner, after breakfast the following morning, he said, “Brie is one of those products that really tastes best where it’s made.” I agreed, and when I mentioned my passion for L’Explorateur, the triple-crème cheese with the rocket logo that I had sampled as a boy, he insisted on showing us the now-disused factory in a lush green valley nearby where it was originally produced (it’s now made in another Seine-et-Marne location). “It was created in 1958, and named in honor of the first American satellite, the Explorer,” Mr. Tizio said, solving my 40-year-old mystery. Just up the road, we paid an interesting visit to the Musée de la Seine-et-Marne to see its collection of antique cheese-making tools, including wooden pelles à Brie, special shovels used for the cheese curds that are stipulated in the regulations for producing Brie de Meaux. Heading out on back roads across the undulating plains of the Seine-et-Marne, we came to the village of Choisy-en-Brie for a good, homey lunch of marinated leeks, lamb chops with flageolet beans, and more Brie, bien sûr, at Au Bec Fin, a simple, cozy restaurant with excellent food. After a visit to the handsome medieval town of Provins, with its imposing Unesco-listed fortifications, our last stop before returning to Paris was Le Domaine des Trente Arpents, the beautiful farm in Favières, owned by the Baron Benjamin de Rothschild, which produces some of the Seine-et-Marne’s finest cheeses, to pick up the Brie de Meaux, Coulommiers and tomme fermière, a semisoft, washed-rind cow’s milk cheese, that I had ordered the morning before by phone. For me, the best souvenirs are always edible.
