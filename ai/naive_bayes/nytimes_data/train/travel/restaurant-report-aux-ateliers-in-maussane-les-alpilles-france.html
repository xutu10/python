Restaurant Report: Aux Ateliers in Maussane-les-Alpilles, France
O.K., so this place has a foosball table. But don’t let that distract you from what’s on the plate.

A restaurant with a foosball table doesn’t exactly conjure visions of inventive Provençal cuisine served in a picture-book setting. But Aux Ateliers Chez Franck et Flo, nestled in a former ceramics shop on the outskirts of historic Maussane-les-Alpilles, has been drawing locals and tourists for myriad reasons, from foosball to formidable food. Having racked up Michelin stars at a number of prestigious restaurants around the country, Franck Dumont, the chef and owner, opened Aux Ateliers with his wife, Flo, in June, with the simple goal of pleasing customers. And it’s fitting that ateliers translates to “workshops,” since he’s constantly tinkering with his dishes, never making the exact same recipe twice. “My cooking is cordial and hearty, and resembles my personality,” Mr. Dumont said, “which is different from day to day.” During a recent visit, the one-page menu featured French standards like steak béarnaise and cod Provençal, as well as more distinctive fare like the standout scallop carpaccio. Stunningly fresh and sliced paper thin, the dish is topped simply with local olive oil, tomato and basil. As for Mr. Dumont, his favorite is a succulent lamb roast, which he cooks all night until perfectly tender. He serves it with small roasted potatoes, which, in what he stresses is a crucial step, are crushed with a spoon, rather than mashed. Also essential: the olive oil he uses to top the potatoes, pressed at the nearby Mas des Barres mill. When it’s warm, most guests dine outside on the simple flagstone patio, near a wood fire. In keeping with the restaurant’s quirky nature, guests duck into a wine room to handpick their bottle. Shelves are filled with offerings from dozens of local vineyards as well as a few from farther-flung regions. After so much good food and wine, it is not uncommon to find people gathering outside the kitchen, not for sneak peeks, but for the simple fun of the foosball table, located nearby. With so many delicious dishes whizzing past in the hands of the servers, it’s hard to tell if the cheering is for the game, the food or, most likely, a little of both.
