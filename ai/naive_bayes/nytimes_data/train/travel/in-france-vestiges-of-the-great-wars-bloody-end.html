In France, Vestiges of the Great War’s Bloody End
A tour of trenches, bunkers and memorials in the forests of Lorraine, where the last battles of World War I were waged.
===
By the time it abruptly ended at 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918, between 15 million and 20 million men had perished in the First World War. That statistic can be difficult to grasp, much less believe; but hike through a couple of forests in the hills of Lorraine, and you begin to see how it happened. What’s now known as Bois Brûlé, or the burnt woods — scorched in four years of fighting — was forest primeval until September 1914, when the Germans came. The month before, just as the war was beginning, they had stormed in and seized the Argonne Forest and the heights above the Meuse River, territory of tremendous strategic value; now they charged into the Woëvre Plain, to the east, and quickly captured a couple hundred square miles of equal importance, cutting the roads from the industrial center of Nancy to Verdun, an old walled city ringed by forts and seen by many as an indispensable bulwark in the east. They killed a great many French soldiers in the process. They knew the French would try their utmost to take that territory back. And they were prepared: They riddled those 200 square miles with some of the most formidable defenses ever created by man. In Bois Brûlé, they are particularly well preserved. There are French trenches there, too, jagged ditches where the dirt walls were once supported by logs that have long since rotted to splinters. But the German trenches are something else entirely — concrete, extensive, tremendously sophisticated, with steps and drainage systems, snipers’ galleries and machine gun shelters. There are bunkers fitted for periscopes, networks of big gun pits and ammunition dumps, sprawling rest camps with superb waterworks, even the remains of officers’ villas. Somewhere out there is a majestic cement tabernacle festooned with an enormous Maltese cross. The Germans, it is obvious, came to stay. For four years, despite innumerable French attempts to drive them out — very costly attempts — they did. Hike around these woods, and you quickly come to understand that this was a war unlike any other when it came to murderous ingenuity, and that the Germans had a distinctive technological edge. They also had better weapons, better-trained soldiers, better generals, better spies, better maps, better barbed wire, better barbed wire cutters. They always seemed to hold the better ground; their strategy was better. You can’t help but wonder: How did they lose?­ In September 1918, the Americans accomplished in a few days what the French had been attempting for four years in this area, known as the St.-Mihiel Salient. It wasn’t easy: More than 7,000 doughboys died in those few days. Afterward, the French built monuments in the area — to the Americans. The finest of these, a life-size statue of a doughboy and French poilu shaking hands, has been removed from its pedestal, in the middle of the town of Thiaucourt, for restoration; I have been assured it will be coming back. I hope so. It is the most compelling and beautiful physical evidence of Franco-American amity I have ever beheld, with the possible exception of another, much larger statue in New York Harbor. St.-Mihiel was a great victory and important for many reasons, not least of which is that it marked the first time in that war that American divisions fought together as a unified army under American command. Still, there wasn’t much time to savor it: Almost immediately after the battle ended, hundreds of thousands of surviving troops had to be transported hours away to the Argonne, at night and over roads that still aren’t much good 96 years later. That they all made it there, on time and without the Germans finding out, is a tribute to Col. George C. Marshall, who planned and oversaw the operation. As it turned out, that was the only part of the American-led Meuse-Argonne Offensive that went nearly so smoothly. From the moment it started, at 5 a.m. on Sept. 26, 1918, everyone knew it was unlike any challenge American troops had faced in that war. Or, perhaps, ever. Make your way around the Argonne, and you can readily discern why. To start, there’s the natural terrain — rocky ridges, steep hills and narrow valleys, all of them densely wooded, and, sprinkled throughout, open meadows easily swept clean by the machine guns the Germans always mounted on the surrounding heights. The Germans had four years to set up their defenses in the area, and they didn’t waste a single day of it: Everywhere you go in the Argonne, you’ll find German trenchworks, pillboxes, blockhouses, artillery pits. All of it was linked by a vast network of narrow-gauge rail; you’ll still find a lot of that, too. They dug vast networks of tunnels, also, and underground towns, complete with barracks, armories, kitchens, hospitals and even cable cars to connect it all. They built some 60 rest camps for their soldiers in the Argonne, a few of which volunteers have recently started restoring. And they electrified all of it; you can still find their resistors — little white porcelain toadstools — scattered on the forest floor. You’ll find a lot of things just sitting on the ground if you walk through forests — and over freshly plowed fields — in this area: bullets and cartridges; spherical iron stars with sharp points to pierce horses’ hooves; shrapnel; combs and uniform buttons; bayonets and sabers; tangles of barbed wire; keys and tins; grenade jackets; shell casings; live shells. And, more than all the rest combined: bottles. So many that collectors don’t even notice them anymore, much less pick them up. The Germans, who had been on the defensive steadily since mid-July, when the Americans and French pushed back a German offensive and launched one of their own, were every day edging closer to the point where they would no longer have any ground left to give. They fought as men with rapidly diminishing options do: Desperately. Ferociously. With everything they had at their disposal, and anything else they could find along the way. And at night, they drank. American doughboys were forbidden to, at least officially. What they did with the unopened bottles they liberated is yours to imagine. All I’ll say is that every bottle I ever came across in the Argonne — hundreds, perhaps thousands — was empty.­ Although history buffs know it primarily as a place of slaughter, the Argonne is also a place of great natural beauty, popular with European tourists. Go to an area like the Haute Chevauchée, less than an hour from Ste. Menehould and a few other larger towns, and you’ll spot license plates from Luxembourg, and Belgium, and the Netherlands, and Germany, none of which are too far away. You’ll hear conversations in a half-dozen languages (none of them English), and if you listen carefully, maybe a cuckoo bird or two. You’ll find lovely walking trails that meander off in every direction through the woods; these are what draw a great many of those tourists, and not the trenches and shell holes that pock the ground on either side. Regular visitors probably don’t even notice them anymore. It’s hard, though, to miss the local ossuary, which rests beneath an impressive monument — “To the Dead of the Argonne” — and contains the bones of an untold number of those dead, as well as some truly poignant memorial plaques on the walls of its antechamber. (A quick look at some of their dates and you come to understand that there was no Christmas truce up here.) No one knows how many men were killed trying to take or retake the Argonne between 1914 and 1918; hundreds of thousands, at least. Among them were 26,277 Americans who died here between 5 a.m. on Sept. 26, 1918, and 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918, the 47 days of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. It remains, to this day, the deadliest battle in American history. Its terrible magnitude is apparent everywhere: In the 180-foot-tall memorial pillar atop Montfaucon, and the countless other monuments that range in size from a city block to a knapsack, and the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery in Romagne-sous-Montfaucon, the largest one in Europe, with 14,246 dead. A knowledgeable guide — and if you’re going to hire one anywhere in France, this is the place to do it — can direct you to particular sites where this American division or that took important ground, or heavy losses, or, often, both. I had great luck one day finding sites linked to the 91st Division, known as the “Wild West” Division because it was composed of draftees from the Pacific Northwest; they saw some of the heaviest fighting in the earliest stages of the offensive, and took a great many casualties. But they inflicted a great many, too; the Argonne is full of German cemeteries, thousands of men in each. “I saw a lot of dead ones and a lot of wounded,” Private William J. Lake, the division’s last survivor, told me on Oct. 20, 2003, 10 days shy of his 108th birthday. (He died in June 2004.) “And that’s what ended the war.” You could forgive a man that age such a statement; but you might not need to. In the Argonne, and to the east around St.-Mihiel, and to the west around Château-Thierry, you will meet any number of French people — guides and farmers, engineers and construction workers, soldiers and environmental scientists, bakers and bikers — who know much more about the war than you ever will. They grew up with it, surrounded by it; they have spent their entire lives looking at those old German fortifications that have decayed hardly at all over the last century, the ones that make you stare in wonder and ask yourself: How  Ask them that same question and, if your experience is anything like mine, they will always — always — give you the same succinct answer. Les Américains.­ One Sunday evening this summer, I stopped in the tiny village of Chaumont-devant-Damvillers to see a monument I had visited on another trip five years earlier. I had found it then only with directions from someone I’d asked in town, who just happened to know where it is — atop a hill accessible only by a tractor road. This time, though, no one I asked there, including an entire family reunion, seemed to know what I was talking about. At the end of one street I spotted a tractor road that went up into the hills and took it, trying my best to ignore the sounds of rocks and tall grass scraping the underside of my rental car. Ten minutes later, I realized I had chosen the wrong path — and that, narrow as it was, I had no choice but to keep going until this one, or some other, took me back to a town. That, it turned out, meant another half-hour and several turns, until, finally, I descended into an unfamiliar village. There wasn’t much to the place, but eventually I spotted a tavern, and approached several people on their way in or out, asking first where I was (the village of Azannes, I was told), and then how I might get to what I wanted to find. No one seemed to be able to answer that one, until a little woman in her 70s came out. At first she shook her head, too, but then she changed her mind. “Follow me,” she said in French (like everyone else I had approached that evening, she spoke no English at all), and got into her car. Fifteen minutes later she pulled up outside a little house in the village of Romagne-sous-les-Côtes (nowhere near Romagne-sous-Montfaucon) and, without a word of explanation, scurried inside. She emerged after a few minutes, having changed into sneakers, and got into my car. “Straight,” she directed. “Left.” After a few more turns we were at the base of yet another farm road. “Now, slow,” she said, and pointed straight ahead. I hesitated for a moment — the grass here was much taller than my hood — but proceeded. Discomfiting noises emanated from under the car. “Slow, slow.” There were turns; a couple of times it seemed as if we were going to get stuck in the mud. I wondered how I might explain that to the rental car company on the phone, then noticed I had no signal. “Slow, slow.” After a half-hour, I started to worry, but her gaze remained set. Finally, 10 minutes later, we spotted it. “There,” she said, and faintly smiled. It’s an unassuming marker, a stone just a few feet high. Someone had placed a bench next to it since the last time I’d visited, but she didn’t sit; perhaps she felt that would be irreverent. This, after all, was the very spot where the very last man was killed in the Great War: Pvt. Henry Nicholas Gunther of Baltimore, 23 years old, shot through the head at 10:59 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918. The spot looks out over a perfect pastel meadow, a view as lovely as any in France; but my guide — we knew nothing about each other, not even names — looked only at the monument, and me. “There,” she said, nodding. “There.”
