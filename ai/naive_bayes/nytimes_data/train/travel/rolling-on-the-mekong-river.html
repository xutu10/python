Rolling on the (Mekong) River
A new 20-suite riverboat starts sailing between Cambodia and Vietnam.

Question: If you’re a successful businessman in Lima, with a stable family life and kids in a good school, what’s your next move? In the case of Francesco Galli Zugaro, founder and chief executive of the river cruise line Aqua Expeditions, the answer was to relocate 13 time zones across the globe and embark on a venture in a country where he didn’t speak the language. “I had built a successful business model in Peru, and I wanted to prove I could replicate that elsewhere,” he said in his Singapore office. The project, the 20-suite riverboat Aqua Mekong built in Ho Chi Minh City, started sailing on the Mekong River between Cambodia and Vietnam Tuesday. Born in Switzerland to an Italian father and an American mother, Mr. Galli Zugaro lived all over Europe before moving to South America 17 years ago. He launched Aqua Expeditions in 2008, building two ships that sailed the Peruvian Amazon. Business thrived, but fueled by the chance to offer his Peru clients an alternative, the desire to expose his family to a different life, and by the restlessness that has been a constant in his life, he sought a new test. He chose the Mekong, spending almost a fortnight exploring every tributary to plan the boat’s itinerary, which will include outings to food markets with the chef, private audiences with Buddhist monks, visits to Koh Dach (“Silk Island”) and the silversmiths at Koh Chen near Phnom Penh, and bike trips into riverbank communities. “The Mekong is so full of culture,” he said. “I wanted to bring something to this amazing river that doesn’t exist.” The Aqua Mekong is an angular, modernist 200-foot vessel with a striking black hull and the appearance of an haute-design houseboat. Amenities include a screening room, a fitness center, a full spa, a shaded plunge pool, an observation deck, 320-square-foot suites with floor-to-ceiling windows, and some highly anticipated dining — David Thompson, of Nahm in Bangkok, voted the top restaurant in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants for 2014, is the executive chef. (The awards are run by  The boat, drifting along at a leisurely six to seven knots, will be the sole cruise vessel on the Mekong with its own skiffs, enabling water-based excursions like a foray to the stilt village of Moat Kla, only accessible by water. (Aqua Expeditions will offer three-, four- and seven-day itineraries. Rates are $3,000 per person for a three-night trip.) In mid-August, I was in Ho Chi Minh City and visited the shipyard where the Aqua Mekong was being finished, across from Cat Lai, one of the city’s main port terminals. Mr. Galli Zugaro’s site office was a 120-square-foot room that he shared with three others on his team, his desk hidden by work orders and books on marine supplies. While Mr. Galli Zugaro chose elements from Southeast Asia for the ship’s interiors — drafted by the Vietnamese firm Noor Design — he had pulled other pieces from around the globe, a way to differentiate the Aqua Mekong from the crowd: an Italian pizza oven, toilets from Norway, Swedish flooring, furniture from Romania, a European foosball table (“beautiful, crystal with teak, and the ball is cork so there is no sound”). The inside of the boat, the final phase of the project, resembled a typical building site — wires hanging from the ceilings and walls, plywood flooring, masking-tape Xs on windows, dust everywhere. Young Vietnamese men wearing overalls, hard hats and face masks fanned themselves in the tight heat with scraps of paper. Mr. Galli Zugaro pointed out parts of the ship, including what would be the guest cabins (“Here, you’ll have a great day bed by the window, and you can just look at the river life”) and the sun deck that transforms into an outdoor cinema (“watch a movie under the stars, how amazing?”). Up on the slender captain’s bridge, Mr. Galli Zugaro peered out to the river. “This reminds me of the Amazon,” he said. “See the water hyacinths floating by?
