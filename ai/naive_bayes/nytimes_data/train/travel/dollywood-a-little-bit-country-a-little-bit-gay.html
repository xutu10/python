Dollywood: A Little Bit Country, a Little Bit Gay
Views of Dolly Parton’s wildly popular theme park in Tennessee can differ significantly depending on one’s lens.
===
At Dollywood, the place on a Venn diagram where gay camp and Southern camp overlap, cinnamon rolls might be the great equalizer. They’re more loaf than roll, really. You find them at the Grist Mill, a working water-powered replica of an old country mill inside the wildly popular theme park. Workers cut deep slashes into small loaves of bread dough and toss them into pans of cinnamon and sugar, then bake them; the crusty top gives way to soft, sugary canyons inside. On a recent Saturday, the women behind the counter sold about 1,200 of them — including one to me — at $5.99 a pop. A little plastic cup of white frosting was a dollar extra, which I gladly paid. The hot loaves of sin are not for the gluten-free, nor for those who might select their food based on where it came from. But there didn’t seem to be many of those people moving through one of the park’s most popular food venues. There were, however, large groups of Southern Baptists who showed up in matching T-shirts that proclaimed their church affiliations. There were exhausted families from North Carolina trying to get grandma out of the wilting heat. There were rowdy college students from Ohio on a summer road trip, and a single mom from Georgia looking to entertain her young son. And then there was us, a middle-aged lesbian couple in expensive yet practical footwear who traveled from Atlanta to see if we could find the campy gay undercurrent that runs through  In a lot of ways, we were just like the rest of the nearly three million people who make their way to the foothills of the Smoky Mountains about 30 miles east of Knoxville each year. We wanted to dip into the unapologetic mix of corn pone, roller coasters and celebrity that is Ms. Parton’s very lucrative Appalachian Southern fantasy. It is hard to dislike Ms. Parton, who grew up in a family of 12 children a few miles from here in conditions so poor her father paid for her birth with a bag of grain. She left for Nashville the day after she graduated from high school and this year celebrates her 50th year in the business. She is a smart and driven businesswoman and has dedicated herself to helping the poor region she grew up in. Opening the lucrative Dollywood was part of that mission; it’s now the largest employer in Sevier County. That Dolly Parton, 68, is also a gay icon would probably be news to many of the guests in cargo shorts and tennis shoes who wait patiently in line each day until “The Star Spangled Banner” is sung and the park opens. But for the rest of us, it is not. First of all, it’s no secret that Ms. Parton is a patron saint of drag queens. Her look, she has said, is patterned after the bleached hair and red lipstick of the town tramp, whom she admired. It both embraces and mocks the best and worst of high country glamour and feminine features. Ms. Parton likes to joke that if she hadn’t been born female, she would have ended up a drag queen. She even  More broadly, Ms. Parton is nothing if not a survivor, which feeds her status among her gay fans. She has defied critics, stayed true to herself and turned stereotype into power. Nearly every corner of Dollywood reflects that. One can see both a replica of her childhood cabin and the inside of her tour bus, her ragged childhood clothes and her glittery gowns. She embraces her roots in a way that never seems manipulated but only serves to make her entire narrative stronger. This, in turn, has drawn gay travelers for years. Over dinner recently, a friend of mine who grew up as a gay teenager in North Carolina talked about how she and her friend, who identified themselves back then as “queer punks,” would drive to Dollywood just to party in the parking lot. Ms. Parton remains a supporter of the gay community. In July,  “I’ve always been a freak and different, oddball even in my childhood and my own family,” Ms. Parton once said in an interview. “So I can relate to people who are struggling and trying to find their true identity.” Still, neither she nor the park has fully embraced the gays who make their way there. Her gay fans organized a “gay day” at Dollywood in the mid-2000s, modeled after  In 2011, a lesbian at Splash Country, the water park at Dollywood,  Dollywood has also become a magnet for gays and lesbians who work in the entertainment field or simply Mr. Wolfe took a job performing at Dollywood. This year, he is one of the Gem Tones, a popular roving a cappella group that performs in Jukebox Junction near Red’s Drive-In, a ’50s-themed burger joint. “We get to interrupt quiet families trying to have a meal with loud doo wop songs multiple times a day in the style of ‘Hedwig and the Angry Inch’ — PG version,” he wrote in an email. He and other gay Dollywood performers have formed a loose-knit alliance, and many feel that Dollywood is a safe haven in the rural South. But the  “Frankly, if Dolly ever heard that, it would break her heart,” said Fatima Mehdikarimi, a spokeswoman for the company. “We are technically a Christian company, but at the same time the biggest thing we have is that everybody’s on the same level playing field.” Indeed, Dollywood can seem either super gay or super country, depending on one’s lens. Consider the  The museum is an interactive story of triumph over adversity, filled with elaborate displays that wind through artifacts from her childhood (love letters from former schoolmates, for example), handwritten lyrics and shoes and glittery costumes, including her famous patchwork coat of many colors. Walls are covered with photos of Ms. Parton and a cascade of stars, including a personal love note from Lily Tomlin (a lesbian icon who this year married her longtime girlfriend). And there are several chatty references to Judy Ogle, Ms. Parton’s lifelong friend. The two have been rumored to be romantically involved, but Ms. Parton has said in interviews that they are just best friends. (Ms. Parton has been married to Carl Dean for 48 years.) More signs of gayness came as we filed into a large, mostly empty auditorium to watch  Ms. Parton appeared on a giant screen over the stage and interacted with the live performers in a well-timed but odd combination of video magic, singing, banjo playing and storytelling. A line in the song “Family,” a study in familial dedication, caught my ear: “Some are preachers, some are gay. Some are addicts, drunks and strays. But not a one is turned away when it’s family.” After we filed back out into the Tennessee sun, I caught up with Jada Star Andersen, a niece of Ms. Parton who performs in the show. She considers herself “a flaming liberal” in the family. Ms. Parton has close family members and staff members who are gay, she said, adding that her aunt loves that Dollywood is a mecca for gays — though that’s not a sentiment shared by everyone in the family. “It’s that thing where she is as loving as she can be about it, but there’s also a lot of people in our family who don’t like it,” she said. “It’s a line she walks.” In a recent interview in Atlanta, I asked Ms. Parton about whether gays and Dollywood mix. She was in Atlanta to promote her  The resort’s rooms were designed for traveling families, so parents could have private space but children could sleep close by. Floors have rows of adjoining rooms perfect for family reunions. But what kind of families? “We’re in the business for all families,” she said. “A family is a family whether you’re a gay family or a straight family. If that’s your family you should be treated with the utmost respect, and we do that no matter what. I say a good Christian wouldn’t be judging anyway. We’re supposed to love and accept each other.” Still, as we stood in line for the new That notion struck me as we climbed the stairs and prepared to strap ourselves into the Wild Eagle, a 21-story winged roller coaster that screams down the track at 60 miles per hour. With your feet dangling over the air, it’s supposed to make you feel like an eagle soaring over the Smoky Mountains. As we shuffled toward our turn, I locked eyes with a man in a goatee and a red shirt that said “My Lifeguard Walks on Water.” He was holding a pan filled with a cinnamon loaf. We smiled at each other, climbed in and took off. Everyone, after all, loves a roller coaster.
