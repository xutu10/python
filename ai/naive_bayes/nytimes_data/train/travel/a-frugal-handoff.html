A Frugal Handoff
While Seth Kugel takes a break as the Frugal Traveler, meet some of the writers who will serve as cheapskate caretakers of the column.

After about 650 days on the road over four-plus years, I’ll be taking a five-month break from coach seats, lumpy hotel mattresses and greasy street food to work on book and video projects. But don’t worry — the  No one likes boring bios, so instead, I asked each writer to provide a touch of insight on their travel styles by giving us one nugget of frugal wisdom, and a story from a past journey that exemplifies it. (You might recognize these bylines; they’ve all written previously for the Travel section.) Meanwhile, I’ll see everyone in March. And yes, coach seats, lumpy hotel mattresses and greasy street food, that includes you. Bonnie Tsui Make friends. There’s no intel like local intel. There I was, in an outdoor supply store in Auckland, New Zealand. I had simply planned to buy a cheap sleeping bag for camping, but then I start chatting with the staff. Did I know what a flat white was? Had I been to the best local beach? Pretty soon, I had made plans to hit up the best little cafe in Auckland and had made arrangements to spend the weekend on the Coromandel Peninsula. In return for a kind word, you’ll be astounded at the hospitality a stranger will show you — a welcome guest! — in his or her hometown. Freda Moon Take the long way. The slow boat. Make “getting there” a part of the trip. All around me, the sounds of groaning cedars and water falling over rocks mixed with the ruckus of urban life: horns honking, vendors announcing their wares. I was camped in the middle of Uruapan, a large city in the Mexican state of Michoacán. Before this, I had known it only from an episode of gruesome narco violence. But during a multimonth road trip, I’d grown fond of the libres, or toll-free highways, which often deposited me in places I would have never visited — like Uruapan, where I spent days camped at the foot of the glorious national park that is the soul of the city. Ratha Tep For a frugal meal, think beyond the restaurant. After a brisk cliffside hike, I found myself walking through the Irish coastal village of Howth. Famished, I sat down at a casual restaurant, only to realize prices weren’t as low as I’d hoped. I quietly slinked out to wander along West Pier into Nicky’s Plaice, a no-frills fish market. A quick chat with the fishmonger, and I ended up with a whole smoked mackerel and loaf of bread for just 5 euros, then headed to a grassy spot along the water for a delicious makeshift picnic. Ingrid K. Williams Accept invitations. You never know where they might lead.  I was in a small-town enoteca one early afternoon in the Collio wine region of northeastern Italy, chatting with a few local men more than twice my age when they asked how I liked ostrich eggs. Never had one, I admitted. In that case, they insisted, I had to join their regular eating club — usually all men — that evening for a backyard barbecue; ostrich was on the menu. By the time I arrived, the ostrich was gone, but in its stead I found something even better: a movable feast that would continue in shuttered restaurants and private vineyards over the ensuing days. Sarah Khan When budget and time allow it, take a road trip. The imperial city of Petropolis, the scenic Costa Verde, a soccer game with a ragtag band of aspiring Neymars. Those are just a few highlights from a Brazil trip, none of which I would have seen if we hadn’t driven hundreds of miles along country roads. In the Baltics, I spent an epic 10 days zigzagging across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, discovering manor houses and palace ruins that even locals don’t visit. So consider a road trip: You won’t be tied transit schedules, and a chat at a remote gas station could change everything. Remy Scalza Small sacrifices can lead to big payoffs down the line. Between Cuenca, in the mountains of central Ecuador, and the beach town of Montañita runs a certain type of vintage bus, originally designed, I’m guessing, for very small schoolchildren. After a bumpy eight-hour ride — and maybe 100 or so stops to pick up live chickens, bananas and people — I could hardly straighten my legs. But I spent the rest of the day bodysurfing on a beach I had mostly to myself and eating $4 plates of camarones al ajillo.
