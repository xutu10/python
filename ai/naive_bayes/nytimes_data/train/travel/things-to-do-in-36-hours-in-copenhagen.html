36 Hours in Copenhagen
During a weekend in the Danish capital, discover art underground, sample dishes from a former Noma chef and unwind in the city’s green spaces.
===
The mystique of Copenhagen is multifaceted, but for many, it begins with food. The Danish capital is the standard-bearer for New Nordic cuisine, a movement sustained by a society that encourages homegrown talent, in this case chefs experimenting with local ingredients. But the well-tuned city, with its network of bike paths and ample green space, supports a wide variety of creative endeavors. All around town, art galleries are surfacing in quirky spaces, such as old butcher shops; independent boutiques are filling up with distinctive Danish wares; and new cocktail bars are mixing drinks with, for example, local craft beer. So even as food trends wax and wane, Copenhagen continues to surprise. 1. Danish Design | 4 p.m. Danish design is increasingly associated with innovative architecture firms — Bjarke Ingels Group, Henning Larsen Architects — but it’s also flourishing on a smaller scale, as evidenced in the design-minded shops clustered around Gammel Kongevej. At the boutique Black, which opened in March 2013, browse locally designed ceramic vases and bowls. A few doors away, the tiny shop Mumuland is stocked with festive tissue-paper balls and graphic art prints from Danish designers. Down a nearby lane, Dora is a new housewares shop displaying everything from cut-glass tumblers to silver key rings from Georg Jensen. And next door, a font-focused design firm opened Playtype Concept Store, which sells eye-catching typefaces printed on posters, mugs and laptop cases. 2. Culinary Royalty | 7 p.m. The celebrated restaurant Noma is still the country’s reigning culinary king, but a likely successor is Amass Restaurant, which opened last year in a quiet, out-of-the-way location. The chef, Matt Orlando, honed his skills at Per Se, the Fat Duck and, most recently, Noma, where he was the head chef. But despite the sophisticated pedigree, Mr. Orlando’s own restaurant has a playfully laid-back vibe influenced by his Southern California roots. The cavernous dining room has colorful graffiti art scrawled on the wall and a hip-hop-heavy soundtrack, but the restaurant also impresses with crisp service and remarkably refined dishes, like pork cheek with beach greens and grass, and yeasty fermented flat bread. Adhering to the New Nordic philosophy, the menu revolves around products in their prime, some of which are grown in the backyard garden, visible through the giant windows. Six courses, 575 Danish kroner, or about $100, at 5.60 Danish kroner to the dollar. 3. Norrebro Night | 11 p.m. Carlsberg still has the largest presence in town, but the future of beer in Copenhagen belongs to microbrews. To taste why, head to the diverse, working-class neighborhood of Norrebro, home to a pair of new craft beer bars. The two-year-old Olsnedkeren is a homey spot with charming décor — taper candles on tables, well-worn benches tucked into cozy nooks — that serves small-batch beers brewed in the building’s basement. On the opposite end of the style spectrum is Mikkeller & Friends, a sleek bar painted pale turquoise with blond-wood accents that became an instant cult favorite upon opening in 2013. The 40 taps pour an ever-changing selection of rare, outstanding craft beers, from Mikkeller’s Orange Yuzu porter to To Ol’s Panzer Grenadier. 4. A Walk in the Park | 9:30 a.m. Stroll through the verdant gardens surrounding Frederiksberg Palace, where sunny lawns and shady canalside paths are complemented by some more unusual attractions. Children will delight in the fact that one edge of the sprawling park abuts the neighboring zoo’s elephant enclosure, while infants might be mesmerized by the curious tree with hundreds of pacifiers tied to its branches. But no one should miss the tiny island that is home to a siege of herons whose impressive wingspans are revealed when the majestic birds take flight. 5. Underground Art | 11 a.m. Across the street from the palace lies an abandoned underground reservoir that has been repurposed as an eerie exhibition space called Cisternerne (the Cisterns). Enter via the glass pyramid in the Sondermarken park to descend into the chilly subterranean structure that once held millions of gallons of potable water. Lacking natural light, the spooky space is today illuminated by a series of candlelit chandeliers dripping with wax, a dreamy installation by Christian Lemmerz that’s evocative of the organic stalactites and stalagmites clinging to the concrete ceilings and floors (through Nov. 30, admission 50 kroner). 6. Face Your Lunch | 1 p.m. To sample a modern take on smorrebrod, the traditional Danish open-face sandwich, visit Almanak, a waterfront restaurant that opened last fall. At lunch, products from area gardens, seas, forests and fields are used to make a variety of scrumptious smorrebrod, like dark rye bread topped with Romo shrimp, chicken skin, a soft-boiled egg and green asparagus (85 kroner). The white-tiled dining room is on the ground floor of the Standard, a mint-green Art Deco building that was recently transformed into a dining-and-music destination containing two other restaurants and a jazz club. After lunch, stop to bounce on the ingenious trampolines built into the sidewalk nearby. 7. Meat Town | 3 p.m. The city’s historical meatpacking district, Kodbyen, is now better known as a trendy night-life hub. But a cluster of exciting art galleries there makes a visit in the afternoon also worthwhile. Start a neighborhood art tour at Gallery Poulsen, which displays graphic art tinged with satire, like a recent collection of art-world portraitures by Tom Sanford. Across the lot at V1 Gallery, you can see varied works hanging in industrial spaces that appear unchanged since their meat-processing days. Then wander through the airy rooms at the nearby Galleri Bo Bjerggaard to admire works from contemporary artists like Jonathan Meese. 8. Downtown Dining | 7 p.m. The volume of great new restaurants in the city can largely be attributed to the Noma chef and co-owner René Redzepi, whose prodigious protégés have been venturing out on their own in increasing numbers. One such newcomer, Bror, stands out for its reasonably priced creative cuisine. Opened last year by the chefs Victor Wagman and Sam Nutter, the city-center restaurant serves a four-course menu (375 kroner) and natural wines in a bi-level space with flickering votives. A recent meal began with cod wrapped in cucumber with lemon verbena, and ended with tarragon meringue, milk ice cream and rhubarb compote. 9.  The city’s classy cocktail culture is among the finest in Europe, and a handful of new bars are reinforcing that point with style. At Lidkoeb, a new bar tucked away from the street in an inner courtyard, sip pear-and-rosemary daiquiris made with homemade marmalade while seated in a leather armchair beside the fireplace. For a slicker experience, head for the glossy tangerine-tinted floors of Mikropolis, a bar that opened in March serving creative cocktails that often get a boost from the craft beers also on tap. Finish off the night at the Barking Dog, a two-year-old bar whose low ceilings and checkered floors are complemented by a mix of vintage furnishings and knickknacks — an inviting setting in which to sip drinks like the Mr. Pink (a “fancy” gin and tonic dressed up with bitters and rose petals). 10. Market Morning | 11 a.m. At Torvehallerne, the city’s wildly popular upscale market that opened in 2011, over 60 food vendors inhabit two long halls sandwiching a cobblestone plaza. Wake up at the Coffee Collective (stall C1), a local micro-roastery whose carefully brewed cortado is the perfect accompaniment to a gooey cinnamon bun from Café Rosa (D8). Still hungry? Grab a rustic loaf from Il Fornaio (C9), and then visit the cheese counter at Arla Unika (F5) for a round of Rod Lober, a creamy and delightfully stinky cow’s-milk cheese. 11. On the Water | 12:30 p.m. Leave the swarms of cyclists behind by trading your wheels for wakeboards or water skis at the Copenhagen Cable Park. At this low-key watersports facility, a series of suspended cables tow riders around the aquatic course, complete with ramps and obstacles for those with more experience. Rental gear — boards, skis, wet suits, helmets and life jackets — is available, and lessons can be arranged for novices and children. An hourlong pass costs 150 kroner. (Open April to mid-October.) 12. Art by the Sea | 3 p.m. Denmark’s premier art destination is actually 25 miles north of the capital — a 45-minute train ride — on the waterfront of Oresund. That’s where the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art — named after the founder’s wives, all three of whom were named Louise — beckons with its world-class art collections, Danish modernist architecture and lovely natural landscape (admission, 110 kroner). Stroll through entire galleries dedicated to Asger Jorn and Alberto Giacometti, and enter a permanent installation of mirrored psychedelia by Yayoi Kusama. Take in the temporary exhibitions, such as the rocky indoor riverbed by Olafur Eliasson (until Jan. 4). Then tour the museum’s sculpture park, where works are harmoniously set in gardens and groves, and on a grassy bluff overlooking the waters of the Danish Riviera.
