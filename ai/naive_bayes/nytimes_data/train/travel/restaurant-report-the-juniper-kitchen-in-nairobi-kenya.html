Restaurant Report: The Juniper Kitchen in Nairobi, Kenya
More an event than a restaurant, this pop-up serves a monthly meal called Backyard Brunch.
===
By midmorning on a Saturday there is a blur of activity in the center of Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, where vendors hawk the day’s fresh produce and artisans try to corral prospective customers. But only a few miles away, down a gravel drive, is the Juniper Kitchen, which offers something strikingly different. The Juniper Kitchen isn’t exactly a restaurant. Since July, Rhi Pulford has been hosting a monthly pop-up Backyard Brunch. “I wanted to go somewhere that had good food In a sprawling outdoor space behind her home, Ms. Pulford and her staff serve a family-style Mexican brunch with nearly all locally sourced ingredients. Picnic tables are set with secondhand fabrics, antique glass bottles and fresh flowers. A rack of vintage clothing is set up for pre-meal perusing; a tin bucket of East African beer awaits those not in the mood to shop. Ms. Pulford moved to Kenya at the start of the year to work for a nonprofit social enterprise, but soon decided she wanted to devote herself to more creative endeavors. Inspired by her home cooking, four male roommates persuaded her to go professional, and Backyard Brunch was born. At a recent event, the simple but delicious fare reflected its casual beginnings. Customers mingled amid indie-electronic-jazz, mixed by one of the roommates. French-pressed Kenyan coffee and cocktails — red-wine sangria, a gin basil fizz and iced tea vodka — were served. Guests nibbled fresh fruit, plantain chips and guacamole until the main course arrived: fresh tortillas filled with Jamaican-spiced chickpeas, scrambled eggs, shredded cheese, pico de gallo, stewed kidney beans, bell peppers and onions. (Particularly appreciated in a city where quality Mexican food is all but impossible to come by.) Petite parfait dishes of avocado-based chocolate mousse topped with strawberries finished off the meal. Guests then lounged on pillows and blankets strewn on the lawn, soaking up the sun.
