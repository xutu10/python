Hotel Review: D.O.M. Hotel in Rome
This boutique property, opened late last year, offers a superb location and a good value for a five-star hotel.
===
­Starting at 220 euros, (about $267, at $1.21 to the euro) for a Deluxe room. ­D.O.M. is a luxury boutique hotel in what was once a 17th-century palace, then a Claretian monastery and more recently Ministry of Justice offices. The hotel opened late last year with 24 rooms and suites. Its current design was entrusted to the architect Antonio Girardi, who balances Renaissance reverence and contemporary design, employing gray and brown hues in the building’s décor and velvet, brick and wood throughout. The hotel’s full name, Deo Optimo Maximo, abbreviated D.O.M., derives from a Latin inscription found in an adjacent church and evokes the site’s previous ecclesiastical incarnation. The Warhol silk-screens, Venetian mirrors and boudoir-inspired bar affirm its current secular use. ­The Via Giulia is a 500-year-old street that slices through Rome’s historical center, a block off the Tiber River and lined with palatial complexes, prestigious residential blocks and ecclesiastical buildings. D.O.M is situated midway between St. Peter’s and Piazza Navona. Trastevere, the Jewish Ghetto, Campo de’ Fiori and the Pantheon are all just a short stroll away. The  ­Our snug Deluxe room was average size by Rome standards, but the low-coffered ceilings, recessed windows and abundance of furniture conspired to create a mildly claustrophobic feel. The room was dominated by a queen bed. On the opposite wall, a chest of drawers supported a flat-screen TV. Beside it, a velvet-upholstered chair and glass table formed a small sitting area. The room’s two windows faced onto the Via Giulia. The thick walls kept out most ambient noise, but the government building across the street, which deals with Mafia-related crime, was surprisingly active in the early morning, and the bellowing voices of drivers waiting outside woke us up (and kept us up) well before dawn. ­The rather spacious bathroom had dark gray distressed wood floors and lighter gray walls. The toilet and bidet sat beside the glassed-in standing shower. Acqua di Parma toiletries were provided. There were ample towels and a large heated towel rack. ­The ground-floor reception area and a small outdoor courtyard are just past the entrance vestibule. The hallway was decorated with marble funeral inscriptions taken from the neighboring church. The restaurant and cocktail lounge, collectively called the Deer Club, are on the ground floor. The Deer Club serves craft cocktails for 16 to 18 euros from early evening until after dinner. On the night of our stay, and on subsequent visits to the cocktail lounge, the ground-floor restaurant was closed for a private party. There is a rooftop terrace for cocktail service May through October. ­The continental breakfast included a fruit salad, French-style pastries, freshly squeezed juice and breads, butter and jams. The kitchen forgot our coffee order, but promptly returned with two hot espressos. Breakfast was not included in the Deluxe room rate and cost 14 euros a person, plus a 15 percent room service charge. ­A good value as far as Rome’s five-star accommodations go, a superb location and excellent, if pricey, craft cocktails will entice you away from the smallish rooms. ­
