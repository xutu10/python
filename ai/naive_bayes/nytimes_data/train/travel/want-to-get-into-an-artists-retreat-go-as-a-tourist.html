Want to Get Into an Artists’ Retreat? Go as a Tourist
At some colonies, you can soak up the creative atmosphere as a visitor, not a resident.

There was no need for an alarm clock — the sun had taken care of that. When the curtain of light fell across my room just before 7, I rose, made coffee and tiptoed down a narrow, wood-slatted path to my studio. With my mug in place, my laptop on, notebooks filled with manic scribblings open, I took my seat. Inside this snug wood-and-glass cube, there was perfect still and quiet. I could take a sip of coffee and peer out through the floor-to-ceiling windows in front of my writing desk, as far as the eye could see, to the vast expanse of mountaintops, all crested with glinting shades of gold and green. In the distance, the view faded into a slender strip of blue, the Pacific Ocean, and above that, a swath of wide open sky. This was my morning ritual each day at the  I still consider myself lucky, but not everyone has to fill out an application or submit writing samples to see that view. Visitors can take in a version of it, at least, from the grounds, by simply making a reservation online. Djerassi is among a handful of private, exclusive colonies that offer selected writers, composers, choreographers and visual artists a residency and yet occasionally open their doors, even if just for a quick daytime tour, to those looking for a brush with the creative class. The programs range in size and accessibility to outsiders (listings can be found at sites like  The colonies’ occasional dual purpose does not always make for uninterrupted writing. At the But that experience was the exception. As an attendee of six artists’ retreats in my five years of book writing, I’ve come to prize my time at such colonies, whose inspiring settings often transport me from the hubbub of my home in Brooklyn and offer the endless periods of isolation that I’ve learned I need to get truly deep into a book. I’m not alone in this thinking. Julia Glass, who won the National Book Award for fiction in 2002 for her debut novel, “Three Junes,” said she had one of the most intense and productive stretches of her career over three weeks at  “I worried about disorientation and distractions — rambling gardens! rambling artists! rich meals! free-flowing wine! — but within three days I felt as if I’d fallen under a spell,” said Ms. Glass, whose most recent novel, “And the Dark Sacred Night,” was published this year. “I rarely work well in the morning, yet there I woke early each day, in my sequestered stone room, to the sound of swallows swooping through the courtyard, and went straight to my desk. I wrote over a hundred pages of my next novel, and never have I marveled so much at the autonomy of the imagination.” For me, too, being far away from the familiar at these colonies is often transformative, an experience that has helped my writing. Three stops along my journey strike me as particularly ripe for exploration by tourists. They are accessible yet can quickly offer the sense of remove that will make prose flow. At one, the charming  On that island, I found myself inspired not only by the ghosts of Ernest Hemingway, Tennessee Williams and Elizabeth Bishop — famous Key West writers whose presences still lurk in many corners — but also by the vibrant community of writers and artists who live there now. I began some mornings with a mile-long walk to Higgs Beach, standing at the tip of the pier and watching in perfect quiet as the sun slowly rose. Once orange and then yellow had amply filled the sky, I would begin the languorous walk back to my writing cottage, picking up a café con leche at the White Street Sandwich Shop along the way. I still can’t think of a more perfect way to begin any writing day. Visitors don’t have to commit to a monthlong fellowship to follow the same path. Not only is the sculpture garden that was my backyard for a month open to the public (I would occasionally look up from writing to see tourists peering into my cottage, as if watching a zoo animal) but it also has very active programming, including art exhibitions, art and writing classes and an occasional presentation by a resident. (I did a reading with a fellow resident, the poet Peter Fortunato, for example.) Residents also open their studios up for a monthly art-focused open house tour of Key West. At the Djerassi program in California, my experience was enriched not just by the writing I did but also by the memorable firsts I experienced. Chief among them was exploring nature. Skip Gianocca, a facilities manager who was Crocodile Dundee in the flesh, made it his mission to teach me about the outdoors. Skip has since passed away, but when I look back at my time there, I think of the long walks I took, sometimes with Skip, along the miles of mountainous hiking trails on Djerassi’s nearly 600-acre property, wending my way past breathtaking towering sculptures that artists before me had installed on the grounds, hopping from rock to rock across burbling creeks. On these walks, I saw my first rattlesnake, my first wild rabbit, my first bobcat. I learned to use a machete for clearing brush. I learned not to be scared. And the less scared I got, the more brave I became in my words. Hikers can have the run of these woods during the periodic guided hikes that run from April to September, and private hikes and retreats can be arranged at other times for a fee. Among the colonies, Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., is one of the most renowned. The program can be daunting for any new writer — it’s a place so storied since its founding in 1900 that John Cheever, a Yaddo regular himself, once noted that the “forty or so acres on which the principal buildings of Yaddo stand have seen more distinguished activity in the arts than any other piece of ground in the English-speaking community and perhaps the world.” Indeed, the list of Yaddo artists speaks to that — it includes Sylvia Plath, James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, Carson McCullers, Truman Capote, Saul Bellow, Aaron Copland and more recently A. M. Homes, Amy Tan and Michael Cunningham, just to name a few. During my second residency at Yaddo, a National Historic Landmark, I stayed in the same house in which Philip Roth once wrote. Waking up each morning, all I could think of was, “Philip Roth wrote here — what am I going to do today?” Visitors can get a taste of what it feels like to live there. Yaddo had an open house in September, inviting the public to tour its grounds and artists’ houses for only the sixth time in its history, and in June it will hold its annual summer benefit reception, during which visitors can see the mansion as well as mingle with current artists in residence. During the rest of the time, its beautiful Italian-style rose and sculpture garden is open to all for free. The scenery is just one of the takeaways from visits to colonies like Yaddo: For any lover of the arts, it can be invigorating to ponder the books, operas, plays and paintings that have been created on the ground you tread, of how the enchantment of the woods and creeks have inspired so many. Katrina Trask, who co-founded Yaddo with her financier husband, Spencer, had a dream of creating a haven in their 55-room mansion and its 400-acre wooded grounds where “literary men, literary women” could find the “Sacred Fire” as they’re “walking in the woods, wandering in the garden, sitting under the pine trees . . . creating, creating, creating!”
