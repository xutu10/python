A Maddening Bargain With a Mexican Police Officer
How much was this “infracción” between Tulum and Cancún going to cost us?
===
I should have known that renting a car in Mexico was a bad idea. Before I had my keys in hand, the price had doubled. I booked through Kayak and landed what I thought was a great deal: $20 a day in peak season for a little compact four-door — all the vehicle I thought my partner, Brendan, and I would need for the two-hour drive along the Caribbean coast from Cancún to Tulum, plus the added convenience of not being beholden to taxi drivers once we got there. Turning to Brendan as we drove out of the parking lot in our $40-a-day car, I dryly observed that maybe our idea to get out and explore the Yucatán on our own was a little more of a gamble than we had thought. “See, they’ve got their hands in your pocket even before you can leave the airport,” I told him. Little did I know that was only the beginning. The drive down to Tulum and our trips from the beach to town were mostly uneventful. But after three nights, when we packed up and drove back north to Cancún — where I had selflessly agreed to take on the assignment of reviewing a brand new resort for this newspaper — we hit trouble. We weren’t yet 20 minutes outside Tulum when the police car pulled alongside us on the highway. We noticed one of the officers inspecting us from behind his dark sunglasses. Brendan and I immediately flashed back to the couple we had seen suffer the same fate on our drive down. Clearly they were foreigners like us — moving targets, right down to the pastel polo shirt and boxy white sedan that could only have been a rental. We hadn’t done anything wrong that we knew of. Knowing how Americans could be ripe for the picking by corrupt cops, I was driving in the right lane, cautiously sticking to the speed limit. I pulled over to the shoulder. One of the officers approached Brendan’s side of the vehicle. He rolled down his window. No English. Brendan was left to translate the best he could in his rudimentary Spanish. All I heard was “Infracción! Infracción!” Then Brendan relayed to me that the officer wanted my license. I complied. After some more rough translation, Brendan said that the officer was going to keep my license and that I would have to travel back to the police station in Tulum to pay a fine and retrieve it on a weekday. (It was Sunday.) That was out of the question. We weren’t about to get back on this highway again without my license, not to mention that turning back would take us far out of our way. To our complete lack of surprise, the officer offered a compromise. It would be so much easier if we just paid him directly. In cash, of course. Then the matter would be all settled, and we could be on our merry way. When he announced the price — roughly $360 in American dollars — I erupted with a string of expletives. The sanitized version: “Let him take my license. I don’t give a damn. I’ll get a new one. If he thinks I’m paying him almost $400, he is out of his mind.” Evidently the police officer’s English improved considerably while negotiating. Because before Brendan could translate my outburst, he threatened that if I didn’t pay, he would have to contact the American Consulate. That was the very threat that I should’ve been issuing, but the officer seemed to think that when I tried to board my flight back to New York, the authorities would stop me at the airport because I hadn’t paid the proper fine. Fine by me, I said. As if the American Consulate has nothing better to do. I brushed him off with a dismissive wave of my hand and told him we would be getting on our way. This seemed to fluster him. He came back at me with a counter offer: $120, and I could have my license back. Brendan and I talked it over: $120 — or $60 apiece; he kindly offered to split it with me — did not seem terrible. We ended up handing it over. Because the only thing more maddening than being extorted by a Mexican police officer for some invented “infracción” was the thought of spending hours at the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles waiting for a new license.
