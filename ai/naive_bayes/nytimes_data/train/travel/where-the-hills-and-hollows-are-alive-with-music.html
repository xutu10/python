Where the Hills and Hollows Are Alive With Music
An area in southern Appalachia, regarded by some as the original capital of country music, still moves to its own lively soundtrack.

The Red Barn sits alongside Scioto Road in a narrow valley in northeastern  The Red Barn is the site of a longstanding tradition in these mountains: old-time music, string-band music, bluegrass music. Practitioners take up guitars, mandolins, banjos and fiddles, and, in the words of one of the genre’s classic tunes, “make them sing.” Other community traditions are embraced at the casual weekly gatherings. There is no charge for entry; all ages are welcome; fans refrain from dancing during hymns; and, just like a church supper, food is brought for sharing. “It’s family entertainment — no alcohol, no riffraff,” said Burl Mast, owner, founder and banjo picker. Dozens of such venues are in this three-state area, which is known for barn dances, for porch picking, for “sittin’ in” wherever a community of musicians has gathered. Residents say it is the original capital of country music, a valid claim given the role played by the area’s three main cities, Kingsport, Johnson City and Bristol. The population of these and nearby smaller towns totals more than 500,000 people, making the area one of the largest metropolitan centers in Appalachia. But the larger settlements don’t define the area as much as the mountains and hollows. An early-morning October drive on one of the twisting two-lane roads is through a multicolored autumnal landscape sprinkled with wisps of low-lying fog, mountains looming over the fields. Traditionally those mountains meant isolation, relieved periodically by gatherings for church, for barn-raising or harvest help. And the gatherings meant string-band music. Southern Appalachia had become known for its musical heritage by the late 1800s. Many of its Scots-Irish settlers brought their jigs and reels with them when they emigrated. In 1927, Ralph Peer of the Victor Talking Machine Company spent two weeks in Bristol recording area artists. Those pioneering sessions included songs by the Carter Family of Virginia (A.P., his wife, Sara, and his sister-in-law, Maybelle) and Jimmie Rodgers of North Carolina. The resulting records led to national attention, attracting more musicians to the Tri-Cities, as the area became known. When radio and television were speeding the spread of country music across the nation in the 1950s, bluegrass and old-time tunes could be heard, it seemed, just about everywhere in the region. At church gatherings, gospel quartets moved outside and were joined by string bands. Front porches were turned into stages as music makers jammed. Livestock shared their quarters with revelers at barn dances. Fiddles, guitars and banjos even accompanied the routine of haircuts at the Star Barber Shop in downtown Bristol, where the main street defines the Tennessee-Virginia line. Beginning in the early 1950s, Gene Boyd, the Star’s owner, and several friends held jam sessions, with Mr. Boyd fiddling when he wasn’t cutting hair. Musicians came and went depending on what other tasks they had to take care of that day. The tradition ended when Mr. Boyd retired in 2008 at age 80. As more formal places sprang up, more musicians began to make a living doing what they loved. Tunes made famous by A.P. Carter and his family became part of America’s musical heritage as mainstream artists recorded them. In 2005,  Bristol’s Rhythm and Roots Reunion, But a visitor can pack a week’s worth of music into a weekend just about any time of the year. Or make it two weekends, filling in the daytime with visits to the new  Jessica Turner, the museum director, is an ethnomusicologist who holds a doctorate from Indiana University. The music played a major role in defining the community, she said on a recent tour of the museum. It is continuing the neighborly tradition, encouraging residents to bring in old family photos that are relevant. “We want them to be a part of the museum,” she said. Interactive displays include a song-mixing area and a recording booth where visitors can sing along with classic numbers in a sort of ultimate karaoke experience. After absorbing an introduction and listening to Ralph Peer’s Victor recordings at the museum, visitors can then check out the schedules at dozens of area sites. Many offer opportunities to perform, with regularly scheduled open-mic nights. There are mountain-getaway opportunities, too. The  The town is also home to the My friend James Noel Smith is a native of the area who grew up listening to the music and the stories. Before weekend forays to area farmers’ markets, he told me, he and wife, Michelle, include as much discussion about who is playing as they do about who has the best collard greens. A recent discovery, he added, is  One of the longest-running musical venues is the  Accompanied by Bruce Haney, a fiddler, and his wife, Rose, I visited the Down Home for a sold-out Friday night show by the Boxcars. The band’s Adam Steffy, a Kingsport native and a graduate of the university program, has been recognized 10 times by the International Bluegrass Music Association as top mandolinist. Ron Stewart, his bandmate, is the only person to be honored by the organization for his skills on both banjo and fiddle. Mr. Steffy is intimate with the music’s conventions. After “Pretty Polly,” a traditional murder ballad, he jokingly reminded the audience that “this is bluegrass, so we have to follow a murder with a hymn.” The band then played “Drifting Too Far From the Shore,” another standard. The Down Home is co-owned by Ed Snodderly, who plays guitar, dobro, mandolin and other stringed instruments. He also is active in the university program, teaching songwriting. The day after the Boxcars show, at the Jonesborough farmers’ market, I joined Mr. Snodderly and Bart Maegh and Kristof Janssens, Belgians who had heard him last year when he played in Brussels. They had attended the Boxcars show. Asked about the music, they kept repeating the word “incredible.” At one point another of Mr. Snodderly’s acquaintances, Lisa Pattison, a fiddler, happened by. The two lamented the fact that they had arrived too late to get chocolate croissants from the booth of a local baker, Pat Lynch. Her stone-oven products are market favorites. Ms. Pattison is a native of West Virginia who works in science. She and her husband moved to the Tri-Cities area a couple of years ago from California to start their own business. Why did they choose this area? “For the music,” she said without hesitation. While Down Home features a college vibe,  She then recognized a group from the nearby Jonesborough Senior Citizens Center. Several of the residents took to the dance floor when the night’s headliners, the Hillbilly Gypsies from West Virginia, began their second number. Flat-step clogging dominated, but when the children joined in, the dancing became more freestyle. Participants, Mr. Smith said, “were obviously called to dance.” One toddler was more interested in the musicians. He spent most of the night leaning on the stage in front of the fiddler, fascinated by his playing. At the suggestion of Mr. Haney, I had begun my immersion into the music at the Red Barn in the town of Unicoi. The barn’s atmosphere serves to place the music into its community context. Mr. Haney, a Kingsport native, plays with Rockingham Road. He is the inventor of a teaching tool he calls the Fiddle Widget, and is a veteran of the Red Barn stage as well as many other area venues. The barn holds about 100 seats, and on the rainy Thursday night we attended, was about three-quarters filled. After a prayer by a local preacher, one of Mr. Mast’s groups — he called it the “Old Guys Band” — opened with a set of traditional songs before giving way to another informal group, with Terry Barnes, a fiddler, sitting in. Mr. Barnes announced his presence with a mournful fiddle solo, and received a raucous reception from the crowd. A longtime area fixture, Mr. Barnes had recently returned to the stage after health problems. The barn’s informality was exemplified on this night by a collie-mix dog, wet from being outside, periodically wandering through the crowd; by a young child riding her sister’s hip as they sampled from the food table and visited with other audience members; by people helping themselves to the coffee, dropping contributions into the honor-system jar. When the audience became too noisy, Mr. Mast turned on a sign over the stage warning them to quiet down. At one point an audience member, a World War II veteran celebrating his 88th birthday, was recognized. Between the acts, a sympathy card was passed around for signing — one of the regulars had recently died. After another song, a band member began good-naturedly ribbing a fan. “This is the only place I’ve ever been,” Mr. Haney said, “where the band heckles the audience.” As I traveled around the area for five days, it seemed that the musicians all seemed to know one another. Many were quick to grab every opportunity to perform — for the love of playing, for perfecting skills, for the establishment of credentials. “Hollow cred” can only bring more opportunity for sitting in. I heard Roy Andrade, a fiddler and banjoist, as he accompanied Josh Oliver, a guitarist and singer, and Brandon Story, bassist, at Down Home on a Friday night, then again a few days later when he was busking with Kris Truelsen and Coleman Akin at the Jonesborough farmers’ market. But sometimes the love of the music is all that it takes for the taking up of an instrument. At the end of my visit to the Red Barn, when the fans were heading back to the highway, when most of the musicians had left the stage, Terry Barnes declared “one more for the road.” He then began one of the music’s boisterous, good-time anthems, “Orange Blossom Special.” Grinning like a possum, fiddle bow flying, he was oblivious that the barn was empty. He was playing for his own enjoyment.
