In Chicago, a Tasting Tour of Barrel-Aged Beer
The city is a bastion of craft brews that gain character from time spent in bourbon barrels.
===
About an hour after my flight touched down at O’Hare, and five blocks after I hopped off the El’s Blue Line stop at Logan Square, Chicago embraced me with a warm hug in the form of a barrel-aged doppelbock — a mini goblet of sweet vanilla lusciousness with a boozy note of rum. It was just a beer, yes, but no ordinary lager; more of an evolution into a higher form. White oak barrels that once held Kentucky bourbon, then Jamaican rum, had their third alcoholic incarnation here in aging this doppelbock for seven months. The result is a beer more complex than most, as additional flavors bleed from inside the staves — deeper woody notes that play to a beer’s bass and an extended taste that finishes with a nip of hard liquor. Chicago is a bastion of these bourbon-barrel-aged craft beers. That’s why I was in town last fall, during the weekend of the Festival of Wood and Barrel-Aged Beer. The Oscars of this esoteric beer sect, FoBAB, as it’s called, draws more than 80 brewers from across the continent in a contest to name the best. FoBAB general admission tickets sold out online in five minutes last August, and I missed out. But no matter, there are so many breweries in Chicago barrel aging their beers, many within an easy walk from a light rail stop, that I plotted an El tour near downtown and the North Side. I was hoping FoBAB would put the entire city into a barrel-aged buzz. It was a bet that paid off — I found and sipped 25 beers over three days. My first stop, Revolution Brewing, is where I found the barrel-aged doppelbock, called the Co-Conspirator. Clearly, there was an insurrectionist theme going on here. Between spoonfuls of a velvety Wisconsin Cheddar ale soup, I sipped beer and scanned the clenched fists that served as tap handles behind the bar; more fists formed the four wooden pillars of the back bar, and Communist red stars peppered the otherwise typical brew pub interior of dark wood and pressed-tin ceiling. “This is exactly what’s going on with craft beer, it’s a people’s movement,” said Josh Deth, Revolution’s founding brewer, who added that he is doubling production of barrel-aged beers every year. “It seems like there’s an unlimited appetite for this kind of beer. Pretty much any time we make a strong beer that I think can stand up to bourbon, we’ll put it into the barrels.” That includes stouts, porters and barley wines — this year Revolution will put out 16 barrel-aged beers, a number confined only by the amount of space in the brewery’s basement for stacking barrels. I could have easily settled into another Co-Conspirator, but more beers awaited. I boarded the El downtown, checked into a hotel just north of the Loop, then trekked west to the Haymarket Pub and Brewery on Halsted Street for the mini-FoBAB — a sneak-preview tapping of barrel-aged beers from seven breweries that would be entered in the big event in two days. I thought maybe I was at the wrong place when I stepped inside — the pub looked legit, brick walls and tile floors, with a gleaming steel brew kettle and mash tun inside a glass showcase. But the crowd was well-manicured young professionals, not a gathering of scruffy beer geeks. That soon changed. A fellow in a hooded sweatshirt and rumpled khakis wandered by my table, clutching a beer list, followed by a steady stream of shaggier patrons. I tasted all nine barrel-aged beer offerings inside 30 minutes, before the taps started running dry. One standout was another beer from Revolution called Deth’s Tar, a heavy-timbered Russian imperial stout with a hard-core bourbon finish. But my blue ribbons on this night went to Haymarket’s own three offerings — a smooth barley wine; a Caribbean-tasting Belgian red flavored with rosemary, Demerara sugar and burnt orange peels; and another Belgian red named the “Girl and the Goatee.” A collaboration brew with the “Top Chef”-winner Stephanie Izard (whose Girl and the Goat restaurant is across the street), this Belgian red ingeniously blended apple cider, crushed apples and cocoa nibs to hit slightly sour and bitter notes before exiting with a faint bourbon linger. All three were masterfully balanced, not surprising as they were brewed and aged under the direction of the Haymarket brew master Pete Crowley, a founding father of the barrel-aged beer movement in Chicago. About 13 years ago, Mr. Crowley was experimenting with aging his private batches of beer in barrels. He found that bourbon barrels added a deep flavor, and they were readily available (bourbon distilleries abide by a tradition of using each American white oak barrel only once). As the brewer at the Rock Bottom Brewery restaurant in Chicago at the time, Mr. Crowley gathered regularly with his brewing peers in a kind of Algonquin Round Table of Second City brewing, and there he passed along some of his beers. Soon there were several brewers experimenting with their own barrel-aged riffs. By 2003 there was such enthusiasm for the genre that Mr. Crowley organized the first FoBAB, and Chicago became to barrel-aged beer what Seattle was to grunge. “It makes sense that Chicago would be an epicenter for barrel-aged beers because of our proximity to bourbon country,” Mr. Crowley said. Today thousands of used bourbon barrels are flowing from Kentucky to Chicago brewers to serve as temporary vessels for beer. Some go on to live another life in Scotland, aging Scotch. The next day I boarded a Brown Line El train and headed north to Lincoln Park, hopping off at the Fullerton stop on the campus of DePaul University. Students shouldering backpacks were bustling along the tree-lined streets. I passed a massive stone church, the St. Vincent de Paul Parish, on my walk to the Local Option, a craft beer bar that offers more than 30 taps and nearly 100 bottles of the nation's finest craft beers. On this night, the bar was hosting a pre-FoBAB party called “666 Minutes ov Beer.” The satanic double entendre was on purpose. Stepping in the door was like passing through a portal from a Catholic college into a disaffected teenager’s basement hide-out. The walls of the dim, crowded hallway of the bar were decorated with painted flaming skulls. Death metal music roared. I waded into the mosh pit to shout an order to a tattooed bartender and was served a snifter of the Local Option’s own Top Fuel, a bourbon barrel barley wine. Under sensory assault, I had a difficult time appreciating my beer. Nearby I saw a face I remembered from the previous night’s party at Haymarket, a guy with a mustache wearing a Northern Illinois Huskies’ baseball hat backward. He was Scott O’Dey, a 32-year-old from suburban Mount Prospect who was monitoring the weekend’s pre-FoBAB festivities on Twitter and the BeerAdvocate website and hopscotching barrel-aged events after he got off work from his job in IT sales. Unlike me, Mr. O’Dey had tickets to FoBAB, so I asked why he bothered with this madness when he’d have access to all these beers tomorrow. It turns out he just really, really likes these beers. Barrel aging, he said, “adds an ‘in your face’ element.” I missed out on the beer I was most hoping to try at Local Option, a barrel-aged imperial coffee stout from Chicago’s Pipeworks brewery — the tap ran dry within 20 minutes. Tired of throwing elbows for personal space, I headed north on the Brown Line one more stop to Diversey to finish the night at Atlas Brewing, where I re-entered the milieu of a friendly brewpub populated by young professionals. Over a plate of duck gravy poutine, I savored a saison that had been aged three months in a gin barrel — the bright, floral notes soared with the extra zest of gin, the perfect foil to cut the unctuous gravy-soaked frites and cheese curds. Then I ordered up Atlas’s black IPA aged in whiskey barrels for an earthy nightcap. Saturday morning, the day of FoBAB, I headed north on the Brown Line again to the sleepy Roscoe Village neighborhood, where I had heard that the Village Tap Bar & Grill was promoting a lineup of 13 barrel-aged beers. I wasn’t sure there’d be any left, but when I walked into the classic neighborhood bar with brick walls and college football games on overhead TVs, a cheery waitress greeted me with, “Yup, everything’s still on tap. Grab a seat and we’ll get you started.” After scanning the beer list, I just about fell off my bar stool — two varieties of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout were on draft, a barrel-aged legend that I hadn’t yet come across. This is Chicago’s original barrel-aged beer. Introduced in 1993, the Bourbon County Stout was ranked as one of the world’s top 20 beers in a tasting survey run by Stanford computer scientists. Today these beers sell out within days, even hours, of their release at liquor stores on the Black Friday after Thanksgiving (even as they carry a hefty price tag, at $25 a four-pack.) On Chicago’s West Wide, Goose Island now rents out nearly a city block of warehouses to age beers for eight to 12 months in an armada of almost 3,000 Kentucky bourbon barrels. According to Goose Island‘s head brewer, Jared Jankoski, these beers benefit from spending all four seasons living inside a bourbon barrel in a Chicago ­warehouse. “They have a real terroir,” he says. “The wooden barrels constrict during a cold Chicago winter, and swell during our sweaty summers, giving the beer a chance to really breathe in that deep bourbon flavor in the wood.” It’s a soulfulness that was evident in the licorice-black Bourbon County Coffee Stout that arrived at my table. First I plunged my nose into the snifter to pick up the duet of aromas — roasty Java (borne of the beer being hand-blended with cold-press coffee from Chicago’s Intelligentsia roasters), and a whiff of whiskey that conjured swirling a glass of bourbon by a roaring fire. I smiled at the thought of 2,000 people jostling for more than 200 barrel-aged beers at the Bridgeport Art Center on the South Side, as I sipped a lavish beer that felt like slipping into a cushy bathrobe. “Ready for another?” the waitress inquired. “Naw,” I replied. “I’m going to take my time with this one.”
