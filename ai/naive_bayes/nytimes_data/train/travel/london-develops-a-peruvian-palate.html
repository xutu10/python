Martin Morales, the Peruvian-born former head of Disney Music and iTunes Pan Europe, began tweeting about Peruvian food, then opened a Peruvian pop-up restaurant, Ceviche. “I was frustrated because no one knew this food or the ingredients, so I started cooking it at home,” Mr. Morales said. “Everything happened organically.

Robert Ortiz, who runs the kitchen at Lima London, focuses on Peru’s unique biodiversity, incorporating exotic flavors like chia seeds, ají amarillo and red amaranth into a soulful sea bream tiradito (£14).

The eclectic background of the New Delhi-born chef, Sanjay Dwivedi, gleaned while cooking at London restaurants like the Michelin-starred Indian spot Zaika, and as a touring chef for the Rolling Stones, comes through in dishes like his quinoa salad (£7), cooked for six hours in palm sugar and tamarind. “We’re all very different,” Mr. Dwivedi said of London’s Peruvian restaurant scene. “It’s not a competition.”
