Hotel Review: Click Clack Hotel in Bogotá, Colombia
High-design, witty touches make for a memorably fun visit at this property, which opened one year ago.
===
Rates  From 290,000 Colombian pesos a night (about $155, at 1,880 pesos to the dollar). Basics The Click Clack is Bogotá’s latest outpost of hipster cool, opening in September 2013 with a glossy D.J. party (and attendant society-page spreads). The 11-story hotel offers clever design touches in nearly every detail, from the Space Invader-patterned elevator to the closet door handles, porcelain animal heads. A vertical garden wall and quirky art complete the vintage-chic aesthetic. Location Set in the upscale Embassy neighborhood (which means armed guards on the corners), the hotel is in El Chicó, a lively design-oriented district, a few minutes’ walk from the vast Parque de la 93 and 10 minutes from the pulsing bars and clubs and trendy restaurants of Zona-T. The Room A front desk snafu allowed us a one-night upgrade to a suite. On the ninth floor, it had spectacular floor-to-ceiling views of the city, from the rooftops to the mountains, along with a living room worthy of a minimalist design magazine: low-slung gray couch, blond-wood coffee table, big audio system, decent abstract art. The bedroom, both here and in our smaller room, had luxe bedding and extra-soft blankets and robes. What the smaller room, on the second floor, lacked in views it made up for in a private deck, with well-groomed plants and flowers, a fire pit and armchairs. The Bathroom Sleek, black and spacious, and separated from the bedroom by a glass wall. There was a rain forest shower that was hard to step away from, though the single sink outside the bathroom was not optimally situated. Toiletries run to the esoteric (Earl Grey-scented tissues). Amenities The Click Clack strives to be high-tech, but its gadgets were often more a hindrance than a help. The large flat-screen TV, preset to CNN, turned on automatically as soon as the key was inserted; maybe you don’t want an international news update every time you walk in the door. There was a handset but no actual phone in the rooms; all calls were made via iPad, which misfired often during our stay about six weeks after the hotel opened. There’s a garage but no on-site gym; guests are directed to a facility a few blocks away, which they have to pay to use — an odd oversight for the lean-clientele aesthetic. Or perhaps Click Clack is less concerned with fitness than indulgence: The rooftop bar and lounge, Apache, where a D.J. spun club hits and ’80s standards, was hopping with hotel guests and well-heeled visitors until the wee hours. Dining A lavish and delectable breakfast buffet, with options changing daily — fruit, cheese, arepas, empanadas, sausages and more, along with made-to-order eggs — is included in the rate, and worth lingering over. The subterranean restaurant, 100 GRS Kitchen Bar, complete with terrace, was a nightly scene, as stylish patrons rubbed svelte shoulders around the bar or fireplace. The hotel offers a limited menu for 24-hour room service, and a mini-burger (around $7) arrived promptly 20 minutes after ordering. But thanks to the errant iPad phone, ordering couldn’t be completed from the room, and instead involved three staff members, one of whom sent a free glass of wine for our troubles. Bottom Line Staying here could make any guests feel as if they belonged in the jet set, and the service and high-design, witty touches make for a memorably fun visit.
