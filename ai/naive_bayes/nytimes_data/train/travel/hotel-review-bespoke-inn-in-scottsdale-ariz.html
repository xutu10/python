Hotel Review: Bespoke Inn in Scottsdale, Ariz.
Free bike rentals, plenty of outdoor lounge space and a location near Main Street are all part of the package at this four-room inn that opened last year.
===
­Starting at $259 through April; $159 from May through September. ­In this affluent and resort-filled Phoenix suburb, Kate Hennen and Rob Taynton modeled their four-room B&B; on bicycle-centric inns where they’d stayed in Europe. Rooms come with complimentary use of British-made Pashley bikes from the on-site bike shop where Mr. Taynton customizes and rents road bikes, and the parking area includes bike racks. The relaxed compound, walking distance to shop-lined Main Street, includes plenty of outdoor lounge space with Adirondack chairs in the central courtyard, shaded by towering olive trees and shared by the popular new Italian restaurant  ­Bespoke Inn, opened last year, resides in a quiet residential area of midcentury-modern apartment buildings and small hotels, but is less than five minutes’ walk to the restaurants and galleries of western-themed, pedestrian-friendly downtown  ­Three of the standard rooms (the fourth is a suite) are named for the owners’ relatives; mine, the Leo & Isabelle, bears the names of Ms. Hennen’s paternal grandparents. A grand sleigh bed was in the center of the spacious room, which featured a 10-foot ceiling and a chandelier over a rustic wooden writing table. Bedrooms have glass doors that open onto mini-patios, which offer outdoor space more private than the central courtyard out the front door. In addition to a white cotton robe, there was an oversize men’s button-down shirt for lounging. ­The same tasteful attention to décor throughout the complex comes through in the bathroom, which had a walk-in shower and a separate claw-foot tub bordered by a walnut shelf holding candles, black-and-white pictures of the room’s namesakes and a framed E. E. Cummings poem. ­Rates include a generous continental breakfast buffet, provided by the innkeepers and served in the courtyard, that included homemade granola and pastries. At 10 a.m. daily, the neighboring restaurant, Virtù Honest Craft, offers brunch to late risers that is included in the rate (tips are not included). The restaurant is also open for dinner, serving seasonal Italian fare. ­As at a resort, though scaled down, amenities abound. In addition to the bicycles, there’s a rooftop terrace, an infinity lap pool and a small fitness studio with a ballet barre and workout videos along with cardio machines. Thoughtful touches include a plate of cookies left in the hallway for guests returning after dinner, and round-the-clock tea and coffee offered in the fitness room. ­In contrast to the glitzy, grand resorts for which Scottsdale is well known, Bespoke offers a quirky, intimate hideaway in a pedestrian-friendly district. Individually designed rooms, generous amenities and proximity to one of the city’s most popular restaurants make the case for staying in.
