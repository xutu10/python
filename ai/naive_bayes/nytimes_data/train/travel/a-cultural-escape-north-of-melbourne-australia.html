A Cultural Escape North of Melbourne
Bendigo, a town that struck it rich in Australia’s 19th-century gold rush, has other treasures to offer now.
===
Ninety-five miles north of Melbourne, Bendigo struck it rich in Australia’s 19th-century gold rush. In its heyday, it was the biggest gold strike in the world, financing ornate hotels, halls and civic structures. Within a century the mines were depleted and the economy shrank, but recently the town of 85,000 has emerged as a cultural escape for Melburnians as a new wave of entrepreneurs and institutions has adapted the historic Victorian storefronts and grand bank buildings to new uses. The former jail is set to reopen as the 1,000-seat Ulumbarra Theater in 2015, but weekenders will already find renewal aplenty. Housing a strong collection of Australian and European art from the 19th century forward, the Bendigo Art Gallery added a wing for exhibition and storage this spring. The museum is credited with sparking new life in Bendigo by landing high-quality touring shows. From Dec. 12 through March 1, it will reprise and expand on an exhibition of the Sydney-born contemporary painter Ben Quilty that appeared at London’s Saatchi Gallery earlier this year.  42 View Street; 61-5434-6088;  The husband and wife chefs Nick and Sonia Anthony worked in London and Singapore before returning to his hometown to open the farm-to-table Masons of Bendigo in a former glass factory.
