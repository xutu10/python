Restaurant Report: Guzina Oaxaca in Mexico City
This new spot aims to bring upscale Oaxacan dining to a city where that’s still a rarity.

For the past 18 years, the chef Alejandro Ruíz has built  Mr. Ruíz hopes to change that with his new restaurant in the affluent Polanco neighborhood, Guzina Oaxaca, largely by striving for authenticity. As with Casa Oaxaca, the menu mixes both what Mr. Ruíz grew up on and his personal tastes. And twice a week, a truck makes the six-hour drive from the southern region to Mexico City to deliver dozens of ingredients. “We bring everything from hierba de conejo, chepiche, tlayudas, chocolate — everything is made from Oaxacan ingredients,” Mr. Ruíz said. “And more than just Oaxaca, from the regions of Oaxaca, where people still preserve traditional recipes.” During a recent dinner, smoke was a common theme. A cocktail made with mezcal, pineapple, xoconostle (a sour cactus fruit) and epazote (a Mexican herb) recalled a tangy, smoky lemonade. A salsa, mashed expertly in a tableside molcajete, mixed morita and costeño chiles with tomatillos and tomatoes. Appetizers included a tlayuda, a classic Oaxacan snack consisting of beans and cheese on a large, crisp tortilla; it sang with the pungent, anise-scented avocado leaf that had been mashed into the beans. Even better was a blue corn tostada glistening with asiento (pork fat) and crumbled queso fresco — a seductive harmony of salt, acidity and grease. There are several moles, which Mr. Ruíz says he tweaks occasionally to reflect different regional variations. The mole negro, a Ruíz family recipe, tasted a bit too mellow and sweet, draped over neat rectangles of slightly bland turkey. The estofado de bodas, a sweet-and-savory gravy dotted with pineapple and plantains, served with slow-cooked beef short ribs, was a better pick. Mr. Ruíz said he wanted his new spot to feel comfortable and not kitschy, and he’s succeeded with small, elegant details: embroidered pillows; green cantera stone salt cellars and sleek glass carafes for aguas frescas.
