In the Northwest, 3 Trips, Planned by Others
The Frugal Traveler surrenders itinerary control and follows the orders of others through Vancouver, the San Juan Islands and Portland, Ore.
===
In July, I got an email from my friend Caroline that read: “I asked my friend Deepa from Seattle about yoga resort kind of places and she said this place is cool.” She added a link to a retreat where sleeping options included quirky cabins with Hindi names and said the spa was “clothing-optional.” Ah, this is what happens when you ask others to plan your Frugal Traveler trips. Over the last four years, I’ve cut budgetary corners from destinations as divergent as the Yangtze and rural Minnesota, Iceland and the Amazon. But every trip had one thing in common: I was the decider. What to see, where to stay, how to eat, whether to brave perilous public buses in Mozambique or attend a beauty pageant in Zacatecas, Mexico (yes and yes) — it’s all been up to me. Even when others tagged along, it was clear before any planes left the ground: I was in charge. Caveat viator. But after more than 600 days on the road, I was finally ready to mix things up — and perhaps learn a few things. And so I turned over planning and operations for my most recent foray — an August trip through the Pacific Northwest — to a group diverse in age, ethnicity and gender. But happy as I was to let others plan, could I control the budget if I had given up control of everything else? I divided the trip into three-day legs: Vancouver went to my parents, Peter and Judy Kugel, ages 84 and 76; the San Juan Islands to my friend and Queens neighbor Caroline Gonzalez, 38; and (most frighteningly to me) Portland to Kiran Herbert, 25, a writer I’m working with, who, like many her age, doesn’t find me very frugal at all. The budget goal for each segment would be $500 excluding transportation, to even the playing field. Assignments in place, I prepared to relax, do as told and enjoy the Pacific Northwest during its summer sunniest, three very different ways. And, I hoped, learn something new about my job. VANCOUVER Ten years ago, this portion would have been Vancouver by bike. But my father’s Parkinson’s disease knocked biking off the family agenda in 2007. So instead, my parents planned what at first glance seemed a rather conventional agenda: culling free and cheap Vancouver activities from a Fodor’s guidebook (borrowed from their local library; nice move) and from friends who had lived in Vancouver. Transportation would be by bus and foot. What made things interesting, though, was that, thanks to a combination of the city’s pricey lodging and my parents’ evening ambitions, we’d end up spending our nights far from downtown. On Airbnb, they found a two-bedroom refurbished apartment within a family home in Dunbar, a leafy, garden-filled neighborhood southwest of the center, paying $370 (American) for three nights. (The budget was already almost shot.) We made our way around the city by bus and up to 10 miles a day on foot. My parents’ itinerary started with Stanley Park, perhaps Vancouver’s most famous attraction, a thousand acres of green jutting into English Bay. Its edges are traced by a stone sea wall lined with heavily used walking and biking paths that provide spectacular views for those who, unlike us, visit when lingering haze from forest fires does not obscure the mountains. Then we hopped an “Aquabus” across False Creek, to Granville Island (granvilleisland.com), which is not an island but a former industrial site turned public market and arts hub. Fare was collected onboard, allowing my parents to exhibit their trademark humor, which falls somewhere between clever and embarrassing. “He’s our child, so he pays a child’s rate, right?” my mother asked. No, the worker replied. “That’s adultery,” my father said. Other days we did the Fodor’s-designed walking tour of the oldest part of the city, Gastown, and followed their friends’ advice to go to  My parents also discovered that favorite of budget travelers: the free guided walking tour. (Tips are expected, but still far cheaper than organized tours.) During the “Downtown & Waterfront” tour given by TourGuys.ca, I felt the most pointed loss of control yet: When two guides appeared and asked the group to divide up, my parents made the call to go with Sahil, who seemed the more personable option. (I would have gone the other way, with the group with the most seemingly single women.) They were right: We all loved the tour. Sahil led us into the astonishing Art Deco glory of the Marine Building, sparred merrily with an Italian traveler who protested when the guide called the gelato from Bella Gelateria the “best in the world” and finally took us to the waterfront. It was there I was reminded where I had picked up my habit of making irreverent remarks during tours. When Sahil described “Digital Orca,” a sculpture on the waterfront that resembles a whale made of Legos, as “pixelated,” my father intervened. Three-dimensional units are voxels, not pixels, he explained. “Hey, we’ve all learned something today!” said Sahil, good-naturedly. We both shot back instantly. Dad: “I didn’t learn anything.” Me: “Not him.” What made our time in Vancouver stand out, though, was our evenings. Where I would have probably buried myself in local food blogs and reviews — and ended up crisscrossing the city — my parents simply asked our hosts for recommendations. It turned out they lived walking distance from several commercial strips lined with independent stores and small restaurants, many of them Asian (and no tourists). Their choice the first night: the Fish Café (fishcafe.ca), an utterly unpretentious spot in the Kerrisdale area where meals are served in frying pans lined with faux newspaper. I had blanched when I saw online that their menu did not list prices, and again when we got there and the most common number on the chalkboard menu was 16.95 Canadian dollars (about $15.70 at 1.07 Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar). My parents, however, were delighted. “There are three kinds of restaurants,” my dad said. “Chain, tourist and neighborhood. And this is a neighborhood restaurant.” Salmon for my mom, shrimp for my dad, scallops for me, 16.95 dollars across the board. My mother said the salmon was among the best she’s ever had: crispy, salty exterior, meaty and moist inside. The total cost was an unnerving 85.43 dollars. “At home in Cambridge, we’d rarely go out, just the two of us, for under $100,” my mom said. Frugal, as anyone who reads the online responses to my columns will attest, is relative. The other nights were equally successful. We spent 61 dollars at Irashai, one of the area’s many Asian restaurants. (It was also my dad’s first ever sushi meal, which I found astonishing; he enjoyed it, which he found astonishing.) The final night we strayed a bit farther, spending 64 dollars at the  Our 72 hours ended the next afternoon with a trip to the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia. Unlike the parks and tours, the museum was far from free: 45.75 dollars total for two seniors and me. “This is one that’s worth it,” my mom said. “We’re going to do it even if we get in trouble with the Frugal Traveler.” It was, admittedly, a fine museum, and it would be negligent to visit Vancouver without at least an introduction to the peoples who inhabited the place before white men spread smallpox and cut down almost all the old-growth trees. In the end, our total cost for 72 hours had been $742.64. My mom was triumphant, noting that we came in totally clueless about the city, and three days later, had “nailed it.” They had nailed it — though not quite in the way I would have done it. They were definitely not in trouble with me: Sure, they could have cut back a bit on the $20-plus per person dinners, but on the other hand, we were in one of the most expensive cities in North America. Plus, they raised me. SAN JUAN ISLANDS The San Juan Islands — a hilly, green archipelago clogging the straits between Vancouver Island and Washington State — seemed perfect for Caroline, a native New Yorker who has long tempered her urban soul by painting watercolors and growing strawberries on her balcony. That supposed yoga spot she had chosen, Doe Bay Resort and Retreat (doebay.com), was not actually yoga focused — but it was both eclectic and eccentric. Those aging cabins (we stayed in Satva) and that clothing-optional spa (we took the option) give off a hippie-ish vibe. But the clientele seemed made up mostly of mainstream Seattle families; the rather fancy restaurant and the supply of Dr. Bronner’s lavender liquid soap in the campsite-like washrooms were disorientingly classy. Yet it all comes together on a beautiful bayfront setting that took a turn for the dramatic the mornings we were there, when two smaller islands — Blakely and Cypress — were shrouded in mist. We dropped off our bags in  “This place is packed,” I commented. “Dude, there’s nothing else going on around here,” said Caroline, briefly regressing to her urban self. We ordered the white pizza, which was topped with Anaheim peppers, charred corn, onions, cilantro and more from Doe Bay’s garden, along with queso fresco and salsa verde. With a salad, our total was $26. Caroline was off to a good start. She insisted on returning to the restaurant the next night, though, to different results. The house was just as packed, but the menu was from another world. House-made papardelle for $29? Alaska king salmon for $30? It was the Frugal Traveler version of the End of Days. The “Northwest pho” for $16 offered some solace. Caroline was game, though ordered hers with the “add cod for $8” option — poor Frugal form. Still, the pho was huge and burst with an explosion of garden vegetables: Vietnam meets the bounty of the Pacific Northwest. The next day we drove to “All right, I want some more wildlife here,” Caroline said on our way down, unsatisfied by our encounters with the wild animals she referred to as Bambis. We ended the day with  On our last full day, Caroline dragged me down a dirt road to  Then, after a stop at the Orcas farmers’ market for dinner supplies, we hopped a ferry to Lopez Island, where it was also market day. The one on Lopez was more laid-back and quirky: One stand sold nothing but Randall Waugh’s locally produced chipotle, cacao and goji berry sauce he calls  Even compared with Orcas, Lopez was almost fictionally calm. If I were a green gage plum, I thought, this is where I’d want to grow. I thought this as I ate a green gage plum I had picked from a tree at the home of Carol Steckler and Al Lorenzen. The couple rents out three rooms in their spacious, quirky wood home  Carol and Al not only let us cook the fresh pasta and heirloom tomatoes we bought at the farmers market in their kitchen, but also encouraged us to use anything from their garden; Caroline took full advantage and whipped up a thick, luscious sauce. The meal cost us $12. After a ride around the island on rental bikes the next day, we were done. Caroline had done a fine job planning, if not budgeting; she had spent $758.93, only slightly more than my parents, who, notably, are two people. She also overreacted to the sight of harbor seals swimming and climbing on a small island off Shark Reef Park, where we had stopped on our bikes. “Look!,” she exclaimed. “One is going up the rock! So cute! Just flopping around! So cute!” I admitted they were “really cute.” I actually thought they were moderately cute at best. But she was in charge. PORTLAND, ORE. Everything was lined up in Kiran’s favor for a great three days — and under budget at that. She is preposterously well traveled (the daughter of diplomats), knows her way around town (a graduate of Lewis and Clark College, way back in 2011), and had magically found a hostel in a fashionable neighborhood, the  Our first afternoon started with another budget victory, as we joined her friends for what I would call an almost perfect frugal meal, ordering off the happy-hour menu at Tasty n Sons (tastyntasty.com/sons), an accurately named restaurant, also on North Williams. The meal’s highlights were a radicchio salad with a tangy, oniony Parmigiano-Reggiano vinaigrette, polenta with sausage ragù — and multiple $2 Breakside Dry Stouts that sparked a very Portland discussion. (“Who started that brewery, Sam or Ben?”) Total cost for the two of us: $29 plus tip, for the equivalent of a full meal at one of the city’s better restaurants. The meal also came with an introduction to the neighborhood and a part of Portland history I didn’t know. The North Williams area is one of the latest to succumb to well-sourced pork and artisanal paper products, rapidly becoming, as one of Kiran’s friends called it, “a punch line of gentrification” as white hipsters replace African-Americans. Kiran also took me through some of the city’s bigoted past. She knows this story well; she had long ago sent me  Kiran’s instructions were to do whatever she would have done if she were visiting Portland alone — which is how we ended up at a live webcast of a Phish concert. (She couldn’t miss it, she said — she hadn’t seen Phish since mid-July!) A bar called Hop Haven — 60 Oregon microbrews in stock — was playing the concert on a small screen above a sit-down Galaga arcade game, and a few dozen had gathered. Kiran was concerned I’d feel out of place, but the experience was fine: Her friends helpfully explained why one guy was playing a vacuum cleaner, and how a song from the second set (“Harry Hood”) referred to a character from a 1970s milk commercial. And the music was pleasant enough, even if I didn’t really get it — sort of like watching a Fellini film without the subtitles. Though tempted to drag me back the next night, Kiran settled for tracking the next concert’s set list via the Phish Twitter feed, while taking me to the Laurelhurst Theater (laurelhursttheater.com), one of several in Portland that show second-run movies (we saw “Snowpiercer,” released in June, for $4 a ticket) and serve beer and food. Kiran seemed to favor food over sightseeing — fine by me. Brunch was at Pine State Biscuits (pinestatebiscuits.com), where the line snaked around the corner and by a window revealing a man kneading dough to be baked into buttery treats, then smothered in shiitake gravy or filled with fried chicken or greens or flank steak. We spent $13, plus tip. And we tried two of Portland’s famous food carts. Both were spectacular: contemporary dosas (pakora-fried chicken, pickled greens and yogurt cheese, $8) at Tiffin Asha, and a grilled falafel sandwich ($7) from Wolf and Bear’s (eatwolfandbears.com) with labneh. Of course, you can’t just eat. One afternoon, Kiran, her friend Carrie Mae and I paid $5 to sit in the “soaking pool” at the Kennedy School (mcmenamins.com/427-kennedy-school-home), a hotel and multifaceted entertainment center converted from an old elementary school. There was a wait (crazy Portlanders), so we killed the time in Detention, a tiny cigar bar inside the building, where I had a stout and, with Kiran’s permission, a cigar. It was my first smoke as Frugal Traveler, and appropriately priced: $2.85 for a Partagas Mini. As if things couldn’t get cheaper, we spent the third night camping in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area: $15 for a campsite at Eagle Creek Campground, supposedly the first campground ever set up by the Forest Service: It will be 100 years old next year. Joining us in tents and hammocks under the towering fir trees were college friends of Kiran’s, Dylan and Max and Max’s dog, Doug. The main attraction of the area is the Eagle Creek Trail, which is beautiful but a bit treacherous in narrow stretches carved into the side of a rock face with a sharp drop that everyone but Doug kept well clear of. We ended up at the popular Punchbowl Falls. The hole it empties into is filled not with punch but with bone-chilling water. We humans dipped in briefly; Doug kept going back, sacrificing comfort for the cause of retrieving a stick. Kiran’s three days came in at $415.22, leaving nearly $85 on the table (which she’s not getting). Aside from lodging and that $29 meal, our biggest expenditure was a Pendleton wool plaid shirt for me that Kiran had been thrilled to find at Animal Traffic (animaltrafficpdx.com), one of the many vintage shops she dragged me into. Twenty-two dollars, she assured me, was an incredible deal, since (I’m paraphrasing) Portland-based Pendleton is seriously the most fantastic brand in existence, and that shirt will forever change my life. I don’t know about that, but the experience of being pushed to buy it — and to visit anthropological museums and gaze at pottery — might be enough to shake up my normal travel rhythms. O.K., I admit, they’ve already been shaken: I bought two more Pendleton shirts in the airport on the way home.
