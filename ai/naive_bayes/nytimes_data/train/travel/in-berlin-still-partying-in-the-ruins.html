In Berlin, Still Partying in the Ruins
An aspect of reunification —the emergence of techno and a do-it-yourself club scene — has endured as a cornerstone of the city’s identity.
===
Sunrise on a Sunday morning is barely noticeable in Berghain, the club that has been the citadel of techno music in Berlin for a decade. Its main dance floor is a perpetually dark place illuminated, infrequently, by flashing lights overhead and packed, hour after hour, with increasingly sweaty dancers. Its D.J.s play marathon sets that run nonstop, night and day, through weekends and into Monday afternoons, sustaining the metronomic mayhem of untrammeled Berlin techno: giant, booming drumbeats and bass lines bearing down and building up again and again, with relentless impact. Berghain’s main room was once the turbine hall of an East Berlin power plant; it has starkly functional steel stairs, concrete walls and a towering 60-foot ceiling. The crowd is dressed for dancing, not display: women in little black dresses or tank tops and shorts with backpacks, men in hoodies and jeans, or shirtless, or wearing leather harnesses and little else. People sway, jitter, hop around, bob their heads, jerk their shoulders, shake their hips, grind in couples; some hug together and twirl around in bare-chested groups. Off the dance floor, scattered through the multistory building, are shadowy alcoves where more private encounters occur. There are no mirrors anywhere, no lingering evidence; anything goes except photography, which is so strictly prohibited that doormen paste stickers over cellphone cameras. The atmosphere is charged with rhythm and body heat, a communal momentum, an ominous euphoria. This month Berlin celebrated the 25th anniversary of the 1989 opening of the Berlin Wall. The anarchic energies set free by its fall have defined the city for a generation, despite recent tendencies toward the international clichés of gentrification. The scars of division are still visible in places like the East Side Gallery, an undemolished mile-long section of the wall along the Spree River now decorated with cartoonish, but often still touching, agitprop mural paintings. One aspect of reunification that no one would have predicted — the emergence of techno and a tenacious, do-it-yourself club scene — has turned out to be not a passing night-life fad, but a cornerstone of the city’s identity. Even as mainstream electronic dance music moves toward the glamour and celebrity of pop, Berlin’s tradition is still to party in the ruins: dark, unglamorous, driven. “This culture is part of the DNA of the city,” said Sven von Thülen, a journalist and D.J. whose oral history of techno (written with Felix Denk), “Der Klang der Familie: Berlin, Techno and the Fall of the Wall,” has just been published in English. “The anarchy days — years — gave the subculture time to root itself into the culture of the city.” Berlin’s clubs, and the spirit they have long represented, draw to the city not only tourists but an influx of expatriate artists, musicians and D.J.s — for whom Berlin’s rents, even though they are now rising, are still comparatively low — and plenty of Berliners themselves who are willing to spend Mondays recovering from long nights or afternoons on the dance floor. As the anniversary approached, I took a four-day club crawl through Berlin last month and found that while the anarchy days are over, they left behind a gritty charm. Berlin is no longer solely ruled by techno. House music, the style that dominates clubs internationally, also booms over many dance floors in the city. Even at Berghain there is a second room, Panorama Bar, where dancers can leave behind the severity of techno for the more optimistic, more harmonious bounce of house music. At the Watergate, an upscale club with windows and an outdoor deck that overlook the Spree (and reflections of the lighted sign of Universal Music headquarters, built after reunification), dancers can watch the sun rise behind the D.J. Unfortunately, the superb view came with some of the most conventional deep-house music I heard in Berlin. But the kind of big-room house music that looks toward pop — the music of globe-hopping arena D.J.s — still hasn’t conquered Berlin. “Berlin has the vibe of, `We do it by ourselves,’ ” said Ellen Allien, a D.J. who also runs the label BPitch Control. “The sound is more rough here than other places, more underground. They keep the vibe here. It’s not for the money — it’s passionate.” ­ The techno that emerged during Berlin’s reunification was a product of unique circumstances: new music (and the technology to make and deliver it), available spaces and emerging drugs like Ecstasy. “Gorbachev is guilty for techno,” said Dimitri Hegemann, who started the pioneering club Tresor and later a recording company of the same name. “Because he opened the wall, he finally gave the green light. There was optimism, euphoria. Everything was creative, everything was possible, we could do what we wanted to do. All these kids from East and West went to Berlin to see what’s going on, and then there were no authorities for awhile to chase after illegal clubs.” The spaces were crucial. Where the wall had carved a perimeter for its infamous death strip, and then where East German businesses began closing down, there were abandoned buildings awaiting both squatters and party-givers. “When I was living in the squats, I learned the most important things for my artistic life,” Ms. Allien said. “To feel free and not to be afraid, even if I can’t buy bread tomorrow — not to be afraid of anything, just do it for passion.” Mr. Hegemann started Tresor by opening up a vault (“tresor”) in a department store that had been disused since World War II. He now runs Kraftwerk (power plant), a huge complex in a former power plant that includes a relocated Tresor — a black-on-black bunker pierced by strobe lights that turn the dance floor into something like a Nine Inch Nails video — as well as the white-tiled Ohm, which books with a more varied, sometimes experimental streak. His Kraftwerk also has additional cavernous spaces used for concerts and art installations. Like Tresor, other Berlin clubs are named after what used to occupy the premises. Stattbad was a state swimming pool, built in 1907 and remodeled by East Berlin in the 1950s; “I learned to swim here,” said a cabdriver who picked me up. Now, what used to be a big blue pool, with its floor sloping toward the deep end, is one big dance floor. So is a boiler room below it, where dancers overlook towering turbines while the bass goes boom. Farbfernseher (“color TV”) was a TV repair shop, its exterior now spattered with graffiti. Inside, it’s a small, strictly utilitarian, almost cubic room with pitted walls, bleachers climbing up to its bar and a teeming dance floor. Techno took hold in Berlin as an import, almost a cargo cult. Though the term techno had been applied to various styles in and out of Germany, this was the techno of Detroit producers like Juan Atkins and Derrick May. Detroit’s techno refracted some of the robotic electronic sounds and beats introduced in the 1970s by German bands like Kraftwerk through American house music and hip-hop, making those artificial sounds funkier but no less foreboding. On its home ground in Detroit, techno received little attention at first. But Mark Ernestus, a Berliner who had made it his business — Hard Wax Records — to supply Berlin’s dance-club D.J.s with rare imports, was smitten and became techno’s evangelist. He chased down releases from small American labels, which were immediately snapped up by the handful of influential D.J.s who got them first. The music, abstract and mournfully propulsive, just sounded right in the semi-ruined spaces of the transformed city; Berliners embraced it, and while other styles have made inroads, Berlin has never let go of techno. (Two companies whose software is widely used for electronic music, Ableton and Native Instruments, are headquartered in Berlin.) Hard Wax is still a prized source of music for D.J.s. The tracks are no longer rare, since they are available not only as vinyl discs but also as downloads. What Hard Wax continues to offer is selectivity. The store is tucked into a back courtyard, a few flights up a beat-up staircase with graffiti everywhere, punk-style. At the counter, a D.J. spins new releases. To keep customers open-minded, Hard Wax files most of its discs by label, not genre (except for reggae). Each one is annotated, like a wine at a fancy shop, with an enthusiastic and accurate description. Another major factor shaped Berlin club culture: no more curfews. The music never has to stop. That helped create the city’s late-night-and-into-the-next-day habits, disrupting circadian rhythms for a disorienting good time. Clubs typically open their doors at midnight, and few partygoers bother to show up before 1 a.m.; they’re probably taking preparatory naps. I tried a few clubs around midnight and found only handfuls of people in conversation at the bars and nearly empty dance floors. The city differs from other hubs known for their night life in another significant way: Berlin still favors music over bling. Its clubs — particularly Berghain — have famously arbitrary doormen. I heard stories of women being turned away from a club because they were wearing high-heels and clearly not planning to dance much, and of someone barred after flaunting his affluence with a platinum credit card (clubs are generally cash-only). Posing is not encouraged; many clubs make visitors check portable cameras at the door. In visits to nearly two dozen Berlin clubs, I saw only one cellphone selfie being taken. Like the other clubgoers, I was left with memories rather than images. The clubs mentioned here are the ones that were most memorable; through history and happenstance, they could only be in Berlin. A Berlin club doesn’t have to be huge or fancy to be ecstatic; some ruins are barely renovated. The dance floors are only parlor-size at Salon Zur Wilden Renate, where well-known D.J.s sometimes drop by unannounced to play adventurous sets of house or techno. It was once a squatted apartment building and still has an arty, found-furniture aura. It’s a warren of whimsically decorated spaces: hallways festooned with old photos or flat-screen video, a dance parlor with dozens of little disco balls hanging from the ceiling, little sitting rooms packed with overstuffed furniture or old TVs and video games, and a courtyard that happens to hold a mini-gondola, a Trabant (the much-mocked East German car) turned into a planter and a much-rained-upon white baby grand piano. The atmosphere is like an art-school party that commandeered Grandma’s place and never left. Fiese Remise — a midsize showcase featuring D.J.s who are local heroes in Berlin — greets visitors like a junkyard, with the wreck of a 1950s car, an outdoor seating area that looks as if was knocked together from scraps and, as a box office, the remnants of a bus. But through the bus is a futuristic double-decker club with crisp, punchy sound systems. There’s a large upstairs room with dozens of speakers scattered over walls and ceiling, and a steamy, low-ceilinged basement where geometric patterns pulse behind the D.J. and every beat is a thump in the chest. Though its music was tamer when I visited, Suicide Circus also goes for a ramshackle feel. It’s down a long outdoor staircase from bridge to riverbank, through a gravel-strewn field in a maze of courtyards to finally reach the bunkerlike dance floor. At Golden Gate, near dawn on a Thursday night — the club’s best night, Berliners said — perhaps 50 people were packed into a more or less triangular space tucked under a subway station; not that anyone could hear the trains. The D.J. pumped out an earthshaking beat and sampled blues moans; the dancers moved as one supercharged, writhing mass. “Don’t drink out of any foreign bottles,” the bouncer advised this obvious tourist. “Seriously.” Club der Visionaere is more bucolic — a seasonal, outdoor hangout by the side of a canal, shaded by a weeping willow tree and geared toward conversation with an electronic undertow; its dance floor is barely the size of a New York City apartment kitchen. In wintertime, the club moves partly indoors to Hoppetosse, a pleasure boat built in the 1920s that holds just 125 people. But Berlin still has sprawling spaces to reclaim. Kater Blau, which opened this summer, ambles along the bank of the Spree, at the former address of a revered Berlin club in the 2000s, Bar25. To call it an entertainment complex would be far too formal; it looks as if it just grew, shack by wooden shack, decorated with cats of all sizes. It has a big, barnlike dance floor, but also a restaurant, a tiny draft-beer bar shaped like a large pipe, tents for outdoor theater and a full-size boat moored in the river, with a deck large enough to hold a campfire. Of course, professionalism has made considerable inroads since the raw self-invention of techno’s early years. “In the beginning people just wanted to have fun, so they started clubs and illegal parties,” said Sascha Ring, who records electronic music as Apparat. “Suddenly people were bookers and promoters and label makers, and it was all learning by doing. The spirit behind it and the reason of it were not financially driven, it was just necessary to make it happen. These days, we are all still self-made people, but now it’s a place where you can actually get something done and not fail 25 times along the way.” Through the years, illicit, ephemeral clubs have given way to places with permits, safety checks and public schedules (visitors to Berlin should check
