Hotel Review: Hôtel de Nell in Paris
This property, which opened last year, offers travelers an ideal location away from congested tourist areas but close to major attractions.

­From 250 euros, or $310, at $1.25 to the euro, for a Classic Room. ­This contemporary 33-room property, in a six-level 19th-century building, is part of Charm and More, a collection of three hotels in France where understated luxury, service and high design are the main priorities. While the facade was kept intact, the inside was completely refurbished with new walls and floors. The French architect and designer Jean-Michel Wilmotte is behind the sandy-toned sleek interiors, which have an intimate feel and include such touches as oak and cherry floors, custom-made furniture, white marble bathrooms and an ethanol fireplace in the living-room-like lobby. ­Hôtel de Nell, which opened last year, is on a quiet street in the residential Ninth Arrondissement away from the tourist masses but in a prime location to explore the city. A major Métro stop, the Grands Boulevards, is a few blocks away; Gare du Nord and other major train stations are a 10-minute walk as is the popular Opéra Garnier area. The streets surrounding the hotel are lined with theaters and trendy restaurants. ­My husband and I had reserved a Deluxe Room but were upgraded to the next category, Prestige, upon check-in, after the staff learned we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. The 350-square-foot space was roomy by Paris standards and tastefully appointed with contemporary furnishings, including a long white-wood desk against the wall. The room also had a small balcony, a 32-inch flat-screen television hanging above the desk and robes, slippers and linens from Garnier-Thiebaut, a luxury French brand dating from the 19th century. ­The bathroom was somewhat inconveniently split in two. A toilet was in a separate room near the entryway while the two marble sinks and bathing area were on the other side in an open setup without a door. Though the counter space to spread out our toiletries was limited, the free-standing round wood tub handmade by a local artisan and the large shower more than made up for this minor flaw. The general manager, Arnaud Valary, said the room was divided to keep the integrity of the building’s original structural design and that only some of the rooms have this feature. The paraben-free toiletries are Charm and More’s own brand. ­A small ground-floor restaurant called La ­Our 19-euro-a-person continental breakfast arrived promptly and was unexpectedly tasty. The spread included three kinds of breads, a basket of warm plain and chocolate croissants, six varieties of organic jam and muesli made in-house with freshly roasted nuts. And our tea and coffee were extra-hot, just as we had requested. ­Hôtel de Nell offers travelers an ideal location away from congested tourist areas but close to major attractions, an eager-to-please staff and upscale finishes.­
