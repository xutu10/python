Restaurant Report: Beluga Loves You in Maastricht, the Netherlands
You may be ready to reciprocate this Dutch spot’s proclaimed affection after a meal there.
===
For 14 years, Beluga was a two-Michelin-starred restaurant on the banks of the Meuse River in Maastricht, a small Dutch city with an outsize reputation for fine food. Though it was widely considered one of the best restaurants in the Netherlands, Hans van Wolde, its chef and owner, had never gotten that coveted third star. So last year, Beluga was remodeled and reopened with an unusual new name to match a new philosophy. In an era when Michelin star chasing often leads to ever more exorbitant tasting menus, Mr. van Wolde did something counterintuitive: He made his menu  The result is modern Dutch food that manages to be exciting and experimental, but with minimal pretension and a price tag that, while still not cheap, is within reach. On a recent visit, we were escorted to a blue semicircular booth in the dining room, which felt pared down and icy. By the time an amuse-bouche arrived, Beluga Loves You had begun to feel incongruous — chilly and Scandinavian in contrast to the city’s famed joie de vivre. That first dish, however, was spectacular, and signaled the restaurant’s ambitious but welcoming approach. Described as olives four ways, it included a small potted olive plant with sheets of puffed olive purée nested in its limbs, miniature cones of olive ice cream, squares of olive cake and gooey deep-fried balls of cacao and olive. It was a complex mix of sweet and savory, soft and crunchy, hot and cold. Next came a salad of chicory, radish and thin-sliced scallops on a black swath of African basil and squid ink, sprinkled with wildflowers and foraged herbs. Each bite was distinct and wonderful. There was a coconut-lobster bisque with celery and spinach, fresh and light, and a main of red bream with wild garlic sauce and tiny spring mushrooms. The wine pairings weren’t well explained, but all were excellent — a mineral-accented French viognier, an oaky chardonnay from Umbria, a cava that came with dessert: rose ice cream and a molded gelatin sweetheart that tasted vaguely of strawberry and was embossed like a Valentine. “Beluga loves you,” it read. And I believed it.
