Restaurant Report: Le Canon in Nice, France
“A modern Niçoise cuisine du marché” is how the chef of this bistro, which opened early this year, describes his cooking.
===
Initially,  At a recent lunch, almost everything on offer had a local pedigree. The zucchini flowers used in crispy beignets that are a Niçoise comfort-food favorite were grown in Bellet, a surprisingly rural corner of Nice. The cucumbers in a smooth, cooling, mint-flecked, pale green “gazpacho” came from St.-Pancrace, another rural Nice neighborhood; it was garnished with slices of tangy goat cheese from nearby Bouyon. The juicy roast lamb that followed was raised in the mountainous Mercantour region and served with baked eggplant garnished with sautéed peppers. “I cook a modern Niçoise cuisine du marché,” said Elmahdi Mobarik, the Moroccan-born, Nice-raised chef. Mr. Mobarik’s last job was at the Réserve de Beaulieu, a luxury hotel down the coast, which might explain the refined but unfussy fare at Le Canon. (It takes its name from the cannon that was once fired at noon in Nice to signal it was time to go home for lunch.) He has the precise technical skills of a seasoned haute cuisine chef but the primal instincts of a man who knows and loves the Riviera’s best produce. Dinner, Mr. Mobarik said, “is a little more dressed up.” A recent menu included a starter of fregola sarda, little al dente curls of durum wheat Sardinian pasta, with first-of-season girolles; Corsican beef with spelt and eggplant; succulent locally landed baby octopus with lemon rice; and a luscious and delicately perfumed peach soup made with white peaches from St.-Martin-du-Var. “During the last decade, there’s been a great little bistro boom going on in Nice, and it just keeps gaining momentum,” Mr. Perinetti said, adding, “It takes some work to source this local produce, because farming is under so much pressure in a region where there’s such a fierce demand for housing, but for me, it’s really worth it.” And, it turns out, for the diner.
