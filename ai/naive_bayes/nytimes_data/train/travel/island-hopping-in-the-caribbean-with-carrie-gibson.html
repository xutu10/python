Colonialism has left its mark on many aspects of Caribbean life. Among them: travel. So the British historian Carrie Gibson discovered when she toured the Caribbean to research her new book, “Empire’s Crossroads.” “It’s a little post-colonial,” she said. “There are still these really outdated linguistic and cultural divides in the travel industry.” The Caribbean airline Liat, for example, connects mostly former British colonies, offering no direct flights from Dominica to the French island Martinique next door. And with international resorts dominating the hotel sector, she found few locally owned options. That made it tricky to backpack across the islands — though not impossible.

Port of Spain, I thought, was brilliant. It has a beautiful big park, the food is amazing, the people are super nice. I passed a very happy time there, thinking this is a really cool city. That whole region has a unique architecture — lots of wooden Victorian buildings known as gingerbread houses. One of the largest wooden churches in the world is in Georgetown, St. George’s Anglican Cathedral. And the whole center of Paramaribo is
