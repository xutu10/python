Hotel Review: Zero George Street in Charleston, S.C.
The overall tone is opulent Old South, but the details are modern luxe at this boutique hotel that opened early last year.
===
­From $379 for a queen bedroom with a shared veranda. ­The overall tone is opulent, laid-back Old South, but the details are modern luxe at this contemporary boutique hotel that opened early last year with 16 plush guest suites spread over five two- and three-story early-19th-century buildings in a quiet corner of historic  ­Situated in a quiet corner of the upscale Ansonborough neighborhood, this hotel is within short walking distance of several tourist attractions including the open-air Charleston City Market and a quaint cobblestoned warren of streets with restaurants, bars, cafes and retailers from Gucci to local honey purveyors. ­Done in a palette of pale sage and cream, with white shutters and elegant dark wood furniture, my veranda queen room was comfortable and soothing. Since the hotel concierge had emailed a few days ahead to inquire about my preferences, the bed came well stocked with firm, lovely pillows. (He also gave detailed restaurant recommendations in his email.) Free bottled water, Izze clementine sodas, coffee and tea were a nice touch, in addition to the iPhone docking station and free Wi-Fi. Although my room shared a veranda with the one next door, it was perfectly quiet — a sweet spot to relax on a plump sofa at the end of the day. ­A pleasant bright space with a large glass-doored shower equipped with a sleek Grohe rainshower and hand-held showerhead, though it was oddly devoid of a ledge or logical place (besides the floor) to put shampoo and soap. I found it a surprising oversight at a hotel that seems to have thought of just about every other guest need, but the hotel now says that shelving has been added to showers in all rooms since my visit last December. ­The hotel’s Zero Restaurant serves wine, cocktails like a Palmetto Express (ginger bourbon, hibiscus syrup, ginger beer and lemon) and dishes from tempura local vegetables to pan-roasted wreckfish. (There’s also 24-hour room service.) A continental breakfast is included in the rate: While the spread was perfectly pleasing (prosciutto, hard-boiled eggs, Brie, toast, pastries, cereal, yogurt and fresh fruit), the service was noticeably subpar. Empty or sparse baskets and dishes on the counters inspired guests to walk to the reception desk a few times to ask for replenishments of milk, water, jam, bread and more. (The kitchen in fact ran out of bread.) The bright setting — complete with outdoor seating on a garden patio — was lovely, though it became less so when I overheard a staff member loudly complaining about his “long, long day.” ­In addition to a super-attentive concierge, the hotel had a spacious and beautiful model kitchen off the lobby where a chef holds cooking lessons. There were also a free wine and cheese happy hour and turndown service as well as coffee, espressos and cappuccinos 24 hours a day via a sleek Miele coffee machine in the bar area. ­A luxurious yet modern and stylish boutique take on traditional Southern hospitality.
