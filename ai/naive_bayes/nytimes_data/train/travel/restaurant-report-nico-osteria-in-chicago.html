Restaurant Report: Nico Osteria in Chicago
The food sparkles at this Gold Coast project by Paul Kahan, one of Chicago’s most versatile restaurateurs.

The success of a new project by Paul Kahan, one of Chicago’s most versatile restaurateurs and last year one of two James Beard “Outstanding Chef” winners, in the lobby of the trendy Thompson Chicago hotel, might seem effortless. Yet in a few significant ways, Nico is a departure for Mr. Kahan. Unlike his previous restaurants, which helped redefine neighborhoods in transition — the Publican, Avec and Blackbird in the Randolph Street corridor and Big Star in Wicker Park — Nico is in the well-established Gold Coast neighborhood, which Mr. Kahan pointedly described as “not my kind of neighborhood.” That hotel lobby location was both an opportunity and a challenge: “Can you open a restaurant in a hotel,” Mr. Kahan said, “that doesn’t fall into all the hotel restaurant stigma?” The answer: As a destination in its own right, Nico Osteria hardly fits the stereotype at all. My first visit was on a late-winter night, midweek. I was staying upstairs but hadn’t made a reservation, so I lurked in Salone Nico, the packed bar, hoping to claim a stool and order some small plates. Eventually, I snagged an awkward nook among the women in towering heels and men in expensive suits. There was a fantastic cornetfish crudo with fermented chile, Meyer lemon and lava salt. The small wedges of lemon peel were bitter, slightly overpowering the fish at times, but the cornetfish was immaculate. The baccala mantecato was a single thick-cut slice of slightly charred bread topped with mounds of Dungeness crab and slivers of crisp celery and radish. It was a snack more than a meal, but it made me want to experience the full menu. So a few months later, armed with a reservation, I met a friend for dinner in Nico’s loud, drafty dining room. After a server patiently talked us through the expansive wine list, our dishes started to arrive, attractive but poorly paced: too many at once, then a long wait before our final plate, a Ligurian fish stew (a special, and the only miss of the night), arrived lukewarm. But despite those service and design distractions, the food — the delicate endive and butter lettuce salad with golden plum and hazelnuts; the striped jack crudo with paper thin radish, lemon vinegar and Thai bird chile, a dish I would crave for months afterward — was as remarkable as I remembered it.
