8 Distinctive Caribbean Inns for a Range of Budgets
A survey of new and improved lodging options from Mexico to Puerto Rico, Saba to St. Kitts.

The diminutive size, steep topography or far-flung nature of many Caribbean locales tend to limit resort sprawl. Whether by circumstance or by design, the following new and improved inns — ranging from budget-friendly bunks to guest-spoiling splurges — are the sort of distinctive properties that promise a memorable stay. ­ Jack Sprat Shack, Jamaica An addition to the quirky and more expensive Jakes resort on Treasure Beach on the south shore, the solar-powered Jack Sprat Shack houses 17 bunk beds in two newly built dormitories with locker-room-style shared bathrooms. Six private rooms, configured for two or four people, include their own private baths. All guests of the hostel-like housing share a communal kitchen on the property and, across the road, have access to Jack Sprat Beach and the restaurants at Jakes. (Shack guests can even charge meals to their bunk.) Though intended for sports teams and groups, the budget beds are also rented individually. Single bunks $25, double rooms from $140;  Hotel Cacao, Playa del Carmen, Mexico Owners of the art-filled boutique Hotel Matilda in San Miguel de Allende have opened this second property two blocks from the beach in the Riviera Maya hub of Playa del Carmen. Two full-size Volkswagen Beetles painted by the designer Tommy Hilfiger greet guests in the central courtyard, where a lily pond and lush banana and passion fruit trees create a tropical setting for the upscale Mexican restaurant Nibs. Upstairs, 60 rooms feature wood-paneled walls, downy beds and Missoni bath products, with Jacuzzis on the terraces of larger suites. Next to the rooftop infinity pool, the bar offers sea views and Mexican-accented cocktails. Rooms from $208, with breakfast; El Blok, Vieques, Puerto Rico The quiet island of Vieques, six miles off Puerto Rico, gained an architectural showpiece when the 22-room El Blok opened last month. Sunlight filters through perforations in the curvaceous cast-iron and concrete facade, creating dappled patterns in halls and guest rooms and providing natural light within the energy-efficient building. Locally made plywood desks and sisal chairs furnish spare rooms featuring tile floors and rough plaster walls. The breezy design extends to the open-air second floor. It also has a 100-seat restaurant and a 40-seat bar, both from the acclaimed San Juan chef José Enrique, serving wood-grilled fish and house-made moonshine. Rooms from $194;  Queen’s Gardens Resort, Saba A scuba diving and hiking hideaway, the volcanic Dutch island of Saba offers little flat land, making the new spa at Queen’s Gardens Resort, the island’s first, a unique dispensary of muscle relief. Last month, its two-story Frangipani Spa opened with two open-air treatment rooms offering everything from jet-lag and hot-stone massages to brown-sugar body scrubs, as well as a sauna, steam bath and Jacuzzi. The 12-room property resides on a hillside at 1,200 feet. Amenities include a pool, a restaurant and a terrace lounge shaded by a 100-year-old mango tree, so guests won’t have to hike out when post-therapy torpor sets in. Rooms from $230;  Yemaya Island Hideaway & Spa, Little Corn Island, Nicaragua Nicaragua’s Pacific coast is more developed than its Caribbean side, but its two offshore Corn Islands, just over 40 miles from the mainland, provide a throwback, no-traffic-lights escape. On sleepy Little Corn, the stylish Yemaya Island Hideaway opened last December with 16 cabanas just steps from the beach, a yoga studio in the jungle, an open-air, organic-focused restaurant and a beach bar that serves both roasted pineapple margaritas and detox juices. The beach boutique is newly promoting “Happy Packs,” packages that bundle wellness offerings like yoga and kayaking with wish-list offerings from fried chicken dinners to organic gardening lessons ($195 per person per day). Rooms from $300, including breakfast;  Belle Mont Farm, St. Kitts Opening in December in the 400-acre Kittitian Hill development in northern St. Kitts, Belle Mont Farm promises a refined stay in a rustic setting. Modeled on traditional wood-framed island cottages, 84 one-bedroom guesthouses and seven four-bedroom ones feature large decks, plunge pools, outdoor showers and bathtubs and, indoors, tablet computers loaded with movies. Guests can take loaner bicycles down to the nearby beach, foraging en route for mangoes and soursops labeled “Pick me.” Edible plants carpet the property, including the 18-hole golf course, and supply provisions for the farm-to-table restaurant, the Table. Rooms from $2,250 per double, including meals, airport transfers, golf and spa;  Le Soleil d’Or, Cayman Brac, Cayman Islands The appeal of Cayman Brac’s reefs and wrecks is outsized, according to divers, but everything else on this tiny island, a 30-minute flight from Grand Cayman, is intimate, particularly its hotels. In January, the newest, Le Soleil d’Or, will open, adding four suites, a cottage that sleeps up to four, and a three-bedroom villa to the resort inventory. The beachfront property will stock kayaks, paddle boards and snorkeling gear, and will include a fitness center, tennis court and 20-acre organic garden that will supply its restaurant and beach grill. Guests can take guided garden tours and cooking and canning lessons. Rooms from $400;  Malliouhana, Anguilla Originally opened in 1984, this small luxury hotel closed three years ago and was eventually sold to new owners who gave it a much-needed renovation. Reopened Nov. 1 , the new version, now managed by Auberge Resorts, contains 44 rooms (down from 55), all with ocean views and private terraces. A new two-tier swimming pool reserves one level for adults, and a four-room spa dispenses massages performed with warmed seashells. View-restricting walls were removed from the restaurant, which now offers a Caribbean- and Mediterranean-inflected menu featuring island-grown produce. Updated with new décor and a 40-plus rum list, the original bluff-top Sunset Bar still offers one of the best locations for toasting sundown. Rooms from $525, including breakfast;
