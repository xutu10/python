With Mobile ‘God Games,’ Unleash Your Inner Benevolent Creator — or Wrathful Deity
A roundup of so-called god games, which let you control the world.

Few video games can be as addicting as those in which you control an entire world, not just a single character. These days, there are many games of this sort, often called god games, to choose from. My favorite right now is  The app gently guides you through its loose story line, and you’ll soon learn how satisfying it is to sculpt the landscape and dig into mountains. Eventually you’ll gain awesome powers, like the ability to send a meteor to explode the terrain and set fire to whatever is nearby. Godus’s graphics are compelling, and though the view is generally from high in the sky, you can zoom in to individual characters. The game is perplexing, entertaining, tricky, satisfying and tough — a genuine mix of sensations. You can play it free, but to advance more quickly you can make in-app purchases. It’s also iOS-only for now, but the team behind Godus has said an Android version is in the works. For a more ethereal god-gaming experience, consider  But unlike Godus, Topia is more open-ended and has no concrete objective. Instead, the fun is in experimenting with what you can create and seeing how it evolves. The game’s simplicity is one of its charms, but some will find it a little pointless. Another popular option is  The Sandbox This game is complex and has quite a steep learning curve. But the controls are pretty easy to master, and there are helpful hints as you play. I love its look and the many ways you can interact with the landscape and story elements. Perhaps the weirdest and maybe the most wonderful god game, however, is  Have fun toying with the fate of all these digital people, but be benevolent. It’s probably good for your karma.
