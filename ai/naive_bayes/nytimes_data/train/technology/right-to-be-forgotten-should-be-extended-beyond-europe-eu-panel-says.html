‘Right to Be Forgotten’ Should Apply Worldwide, E.U. Panel Says

LONDON — Europe is taking aim at Google, again. Privacy watchdogs in the  The new guidelines, issued by a panel composed of privacy regulators from the bloc’s 28 member states, would require Google, in certain cases, to take down links at the request of individuals in search domains in Europe as well as outside the region. Currently, a ruling by the highest court in the European Union applies only to the company’s European domains, like  Europe’s privacy watchdogs said, however, that this interpretation of the decision did not go far enough to guarantee privacy. “Under E.U. law, everyone has a right to data protection,” the regulatory body said in  It is unclear whether the guidelines were intended to apply to requests made only by residents of the European Union, or if people in other countries could use the ruling to make requests for links to be removed. “This is a line that U.S. companies will be very reluctant to cross,” said Ian Brown, a professor of information security and privacy at the University of Oxford, in discussing the potential global use of Europe’s privacy ruling. “It will come down to who blinks first. The companies or the privacy regulators.” The guidelines are not binding. It is up to European Union member countries to decide how to apply them A Google spokesman said on Wednesday that the company had yet to review the new privacy guidelines, but that it would do so when they are published. The “right to be forgotten” ruling has become a major point of contention between privacy advocates, who believe individuals have the right to ask that links be removed, and campaigners for freedom of expression, who have stressed that the legal decision unjustly limits what can be published online. Since the ruling in May, Google — which holds close to 85 percent of Europe’s online search market — has received roughly 175,000 requests, from people in Europe and outside the region, to remove links to online material, according to the company’s  Individuals who wish for online content to be removed from search results must submit requests to search engines with links to the content, and Google has agreed so far to about 42 percent of the requests. If people are not satisfied with the companies’ decisions, they can refer their submissions to national data regulators. While the guidelines are not legally binding, data protection experts say that some national watchdogs may seek to comply with the recommendations. But European regulators conceded that it might be hard to force Google and other search engines to comply with the rules in jurisdictions like the United States that do not have the same privacy rules. In a nod to this difficulty, the regulators said that they would initially concentrate on “claims where there is a clear link between the data subject and the E.U., for instance where the data subject is a citizen or resident of an E.U. member state,” they said on Wednesday. The announcement Wednesday continues a series of conflicts between Google and European regulators, and is unlikely to be the last. On Thursday, a resolution in the European Parliament is expected to
