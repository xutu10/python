Fashion and Functionality Meet in Smart Jewelry
Manufacturers are teaming up with designers to produce stylish bracelets, rings and cuff links that are also tech devices.

The companies making wearable devices have tended to emphasize function over fashion. But that is starting to change. Apple, for example, has tried to make its coming Apple Watch fashionable, offering multiple face and band colors. Other device makers, meanwhile, are collaborating with fashion designers to put design higher on the priority list. Here are a few of the stylish standouts. $38-$195 Fitbit was one of the first companies to offer fitness tracking devices, so it makes sense that it was one of the first to team up with a fashion designer, the hugely popular Tory Burch. Ms. Burch’s versatile collection places a Fitbit Flex into a silicone printed bracelet in navy or fuchsia for everyday wear and a brass hinged bracelet and brass pendant necklace for an evening out. $60 and $120 Case-Mate has a reputation for producing elegant tech accessories, including its collection of smartphone cases from Rebecca Minkoff, whose handbags are available at department stores like Nordstrom. Now, it is producing a line of wearable tech, which made its debut at New York Fashion Week and will be available this fall. The line includes a gold chain-link bracelet that alerts the wearer of push notifications and a studded leather bracelet with an Apple Lightning charger hidden inside. $195-$260 Ringly, a start-up whose founders include Christina Mercando, a product designer, is introducing a cocktail-style ring that can alert wearers to calls, texts or calendar events. Using an app synced to the ring, wearers can customize the alerts to make the ring vibrate or light up. The smart rings, which will be available this winter, come in five styles, each with a different precious or semiprecious stone. $99 Netatmo makes devices that test the atmosphere, like weather stations and thermostats. Its first wearable tech, the smart band June, measures sun exposure and provides recommendations to encourage better sun protection habits. June can suggest an appropriate S.P.F., for instance, and remind the wearer to put on a hat. June’s multifaceted monitor is available in three colors — platinum, gold and gunmetal — and can be paired with either a leather or silicon band. $1,000  Intel and the fashion house Opening Ceremony made a big spectacle introducing MICA, short for My Intelligent Communication Accessory, at Fashion Week in New York, but little is known about the device, a bracelet. Intel did say that it would feature communications capabilities and wireless charging. The bracelet will come in two designs with semiprecious stones, snakeskin and a curved touch-screen display. Intel says that additional features will be revealed later, and that the device will be available at Barneys New York this holiday season. $199 Fashion designers have turned much of their attention to wearable tech options for women, but Dalys 1895 puts the focus on men. The company, an online purveyor of high-quality men’s accessories, has introduced a pair of sterling silver cuff links with a 16-gigabyte USB drive inside. The cuff links can be personalized with a monogram, and Dalys offers limited-edition, hand-engraved edges for an extra $50.
