Merchant Customer Exchange Says It May Adopt Apple Pay’s Technology

Facing pressure from supporters of  The group of retailers, known as the Merchant Customer Exchange, said that it could yet decide to use Near Field Communication capability, the technology that Apple Pay relies on to process transactions. But the chief executive of the group said the technology was beside the point. “I think there’s been a mistake made here, and that is focusing on the technology instead of what business or consumer problem you’re trying to solve,” Dekkers Davidson, chief executive of the exchange, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. Near Field Communication generally allows customers to make purchases in retail stores by waving their smartphones over a payment terminal. It is the cornerstone of how Apple Pay, which is available only in iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones, functions in brick-and-mortar businesses. Adopting the technology would be a significant departure from the exchange’s original plans for CurrentC, the mobile wallet app the Merchant Customer Exchange is working on. CurrentC was built to work on so-called QR code technology, which acts like a scannable bar code. Mr. Davidson said this was because it was the fastest way to put the app, which will not be available until next year, in consumers’ hands. He noted that people in the industry had largely written off Near Field Communication as a mobile payment option — until, that is, Apple incorporated it. “It’s ironic in a way that we’re talking about a really old technology being employed here,” Mr. Davidson said. “Way before Apple Pay, merchants hadn’t enabled it or planned on using it.” The retailers have incentives to build their own wallet offerings. If CurrentC were to be successful, it could give participating merchants insight into how people shop. In some cases, it could let merchants pay lower processing fees on each transaction. But exchange merchants are in a bind. The exchange’s contract prohibits partners from accepting competing mobile wallets, including Apple Pay. That means if Apple Pay is a hit, retailers will not be permitted to accept the form of payment as long as they are exchange partners. A Also on Wednesday, the exchange disclosed that its email provider had been hacked, and that unauthorized parties had gained access to the email addresses of an undisclosed number of people.
