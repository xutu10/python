Just the Facts? This Dossier Goes Further
A company starts with data it compiles on journalists, then makes its own suppositions in its profiles of them.
===
It was my birthday the other day, and, along with the usual private greetings from family and friends, I noticed a couple of public salutations about it on Twitter from entities I didn’t recognize. One was from @TalkingBizNews, a business news feed, which issued posts about my birthday and that of Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network. Apparently, we have the same birthday. I was curious to find out where these greeters had obtained their information, since I don’t, for data security reasons, share my birth date with sites or stores. Did they get it from public records? Or had they bought it from one of the many companies that sell consumers’ details for marketing purposes? When I started looking into it, I discovered that one company had compiled information about me that was far more personal than my birthday — including references to my father’s marriages and my sister’s wedding announcement. Some of the material was factually accurate. Other elements were speculative. I have written  First, I contacted  “I frankly can’t remember how I got your birthday,” Professor Roush said. Next I contacted NewsBios, a service in Denver that also posts the birthdays of certain reporters and editors.  The clients are primarily public relations firms and corporations seeking to prep company executives on the journalists who interview them. Mr. Rotbart said news organizations had also bought the profiles for use in hiring staff members or checking out their competitors. “The idea is to write true dossiers on journalists, unvarnished dossiers,” he said, “things they would not disclose or be inclined to disclose” on LinkedIn. The reports may include “information that reflects on the journalist’s character and proclivities,” according to the NewsBios site. NewsBios’ small-scale intelligence-gathering bears some resemblance to the computerized data-mining that large-scale information brokers use to classify consumers’ behavior. For instance, Experian Marketing Services, which helps companies tailor their marketing pitches,  NewsBios compiles information on journalists from public sources like voter records, real estate records and motor vehicle records. It also parses their public social media accounts for clues about their political leanings, entertainment interests and favorite sports teams. And it makes inferences based on that data. “We will literally turn over every rock that’s out there that might have some bearing on what the journalist thinks or reports,” Mr. Rotbart said. After our phone chat, Mr. Rotbart kindly sent me my own profile. A client had apparently commissioned it in 2009, the year I moved to a new job as a reporter in the business news department of this newspaper from its Style section. The profile has not been sold or updated since, he said. The dossier contained many correct facts — the universities from which I graduated, my contact information, the name of my editor at the time, a list of some front-page articles I had written, citations from published corrections to my articles. There were also a couple of errors. The profile said I had written for a magazine to which I never contributed. It also mistakenly attributed a conservative editorial — published in The Forward, where I had worked as a Moscow correspondent in the 1990s — to me, citing the piece as evidence of my personal politics. I was not much troubled by the factual errors in my profile. As people who regularly check their credit reports well know, companies often collect incorrect information — and even correct data can quickly become out of date. But I was uncomfortable with instances in the profile that speculated on my personal motives or feelings. These assumptions were often off base, yet had the potential to affect my reputation. The dossier, for instance, contained a cropped photograph of the back of my head and neck. Under the picture was a note, tagged “NewsBios Observation” to indicate that it was opinion. “The fact that only the back of her head is showing may be coincidental,” the profile said, “or it may be further evidence that she, a veteran fashion and cosmetics industry reporter, herself has a low self-esteem when it comes to appearances.” In fact, the original photo, which ran in this newspaper to accompany  Even so, Mr. Rotbart contended that the profile made a reasonable deduction about my self-esteem — based on the fact that I looked frumpy in the picture and that there were fewer photos of me online than of many other reporters. When I told him I cover privacy issues — that’s the reason I have opted to use an avatar on Twitter — he allowed: “It may be 100 percent that you have a personal privacy thing.” He said that he would amend and update my profile should a client order it again. NewsBios employs techniques that journalists use: Doing web searches of people’s backgrounds, reading their social media posts to learn more about them and drawing conclusions. The difference is that journalists generally notify and seek interviews with the subjects of profiles, whereas NewsBios promises to “never contact the journalists directly.” Mr. Rotbart said NewsBios prepares briefs on reporters similar to those compiled by public relations firms and corporate communications departments. Corporations don’t tell journalists that they are the subjects of internal briefings, either. I also contacted Vocus and Cision, companies that each sell information about journalists to public relations professionals. Their profiles of me contained only facts, not suppositions. There is little recourse, however, for subjects of data profiling, says  With the exception of sectors like health care and credit, most consumer data is not protected by federal information practices laws. That leaves companies free, he says, to piece together the digital bread crumbs that people leave in their wake into a simulacrum that may bear little resemblance to the actual person. “It points to the gaps in federal regulation,” says Professor Vladeck, a former director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Data broker reports can be inaccurate and can be misconstrued in ways that are unflattering to the individual. Yet consequential decisions can be based on them.”
