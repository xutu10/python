Madshus Cross-Country Skis Evolve With the Times
Several models have microchips installed to make choosing skis and tracking activity easier, and an app helps determine when and how to wax.

For years, many people thought of the cross-country skier as either a solitary tree hugger out in the woods, icicles hanging from a frozen beard, or perhaps as a perfect human specimen struggling across the finish line of a long race in Finland and promptly vomiting onto the snow. While those images may endure, the sport has experienced a renaissance of sorts among millions of health-conscious Americans eager to burn 300 to 700 calories an hour when the winter chill and snow on the ground keep them from their regular outdoor exercise, like jogging or biking. According to Snowsports Industries America, a trade group, more than three million Americans took to the trails in 2013-14. Like Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing appeals to an affluent and educated clientele: 49 percent of cross-country skiers have household incomes of more than $75,000 and 59 percent have a bachelor’s degree or higher. Even as the sport has become popular and more mainstream, the prosaic ski has been slower to evolve. The choices are still between waxable and waxless skis. But the digital age is coming, particularly with the  “We wanted to create a finished product that is perfect,” said Chris McCullough, the global brand manager for K2 Outdoor, the parent company of Madshus skis. He added, “A tag goes into the ski and gives it a unique signature, one microchip per ski.” Madshus was founded in 1906 by Martin Madshus in a barn in Vardal, Norway. It has been based in the village of Biri since 1972 and, with Asnes, is one of the two remaining ski manufacturers in Norway, home to thousands of cross-country skiers. What’s smart about these skis? First, the guesswork about which ski to buy is mostly eliminated by the microchip embedded in each ski. The proper fitting for cross-country skis is not rocket science, but the infusion of digital technology promises to make it more precise. An optimum experience for the skier depends on skis with the correct flexibility, length and stiffness. At the factory, a radio-frequency identification chip with near-field communication, or NFC, capability is inserted in the skis. Then, when the skis are delivered to retail outlets, sales personnel and customers can build a profile using an Acer tablet and custom software. The software calls for entering the skier’s height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms), and level of ability, ski style (classical or skate) and experience. Customers are immediately pointed to a selection of skis in store inventory that fit the profile. “I’m not really clear on how it all works, but it expands on a tool for the salesperson, the wax zones, the profile,” said Ted Clarke, an avid biker and skier who was checking out new skis at the Skirack in Burlington, Vt., recently and speaking through a Skype video hookup. “It does help me decide which skis to buy,” he continued. “It’s all on the screen. It’s nice to know my options rather than guesswork. I like being able to see the data.” The skis are even smarter than that, though; the free Madshus smartphone app, on  Skiers enter their personal details into the app and pair it with their skis. Before they hit the trails, they can also enter information about the weather and snow conditions. The app then recommends the best wax and the optimum places on the ski to apply the wax. During time on the trails, the app will catalog a skier’s performance, much as the Runkeeper app tracks a runner’s or a biker’s outing — mapping the run, tracking distance and calories burned, for example. After a day out on the trails, the app allows that information to be shared across social media. Perhaps the app’s most useful information is about waxing, a feature of cross-country skiing that borders on  For most people, getting waxing right is simply much too complex, which is where the app can help to simplify. Anyone can wax a ski, but most people would like to spend less time waxing and more time skiing. For now, the eMpower technology is available only on 10 classical and skate skis in the Madshus Redline ($760), Nanosonic ($655) and Hypersonic ($475) lines. Having a chip in your cross-country skis might sound a bit gimmicky, but how many of us can say, “My phone talks to my skis”?
