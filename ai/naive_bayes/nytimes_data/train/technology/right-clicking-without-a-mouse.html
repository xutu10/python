Q. A. If you would like to adjust the amount of time needed to press and hold until the menu appears, go to the Windows Control Panel by tapping open the PC Settings app on the Apps screen and tapping the Control Panel link at the bottom of the list. (On a Windows 8.1 computer with a regular keyboard, you can also get there by pressing the Windows and X keys and selecting Control Panel from the menu that pops up.) In the All Control Panel Items window, select “Pen and Touch.” In the box that appears, choose “Press and hold/Right-click” and tap the Settings button. In the “Press and Hold” settings box, you can move the sliders to change the speed and duration required for the action. Tap the OK button when you are satisfied with your changes.
