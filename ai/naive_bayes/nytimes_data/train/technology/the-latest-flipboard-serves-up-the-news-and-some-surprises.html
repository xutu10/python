The Latest Flipboard Serves Up the News and Some Surprises
The latest version of the Flipboard tablet magazine offers a staff-selected “front page” of stories and a wide range of extremely specialized topics.

A FEW months after Apple began selling the iPad in 2010, Mike McCue, a former employee at Microsoft, and Evan Doll, formerly with Apple, unveiled the first truly great app for the new tablet computer. The app was called Flipboard, and in many ways it was a harbinger of the great mobile-app-fueled frenzy that would soon overrun much of the web, especially news sites. Flipboard was a personalized tablet magazine — not the first tablet magazine, but the first worthy of the name. The app scoured your social media profiles to find stories that people you knew were linking to. Then it arranged those stories into a beautiful magazine format that you could navigate through intuitive gestures. Flipboard became an instant sensation, and when the company created a smartphone version in 2011, the service became even more popular. Now Flipboard has about 100 million users across various devices, Mr. McCue, the company’s chief executive, said during a recent interview. But although its user base is growing, Flipboard has strong competition from a number of rival news apps. At the top of that heap is Facebook’s app, which is by far the most popular one for news-reading on mobile devices. This week Flipboard is introducing a terrific new version that it hopes will catapult its app to a wider audience. Flipboard 3.0 features a few clever design tweaks, a better search interface, and a set of tools that allow for greater personalization of users’ news feeds. It also has a new section called The Daily Edition that is meant to stand apart from the app’s central mission of personalizing the news. The Daily Edition is not personalized — it’s a few pages of stories picked by a team of editors working at Flipboard, a kind of daily front page for the app age. It’s this subtle blending of human selection and algorithmic expertise that helps the new Flipboard shine. Though the app bills itself as offering a “personalized” magazine, it’s best not to read too much into the personalized part. Flipboard is not presenting a narrow stream of news, and it certainly is not in danger of inflating the dreaded “ Instead, what is best about the new Flipboard is how it manages to offer a selection of news tailored to your broad interests that never feels too on-the-nose. Its algorithms allow for serendipity, curiosity and surprise in your feed; often, while flipping through the app, I saw stories that I most likely wouldn’t have caught elsewhere during my travels online, but that were nevertheless pretty good. (Like “ Flipboard achieves this mix of interest and surprise as a result of  “We used to ask people to pick 30 high-level topics when you would set up the product — things like news, tech, sports, science, that kind of thing,” Mr. McCue said. “But, you know, people don’t like ‘science.’ They actually like physics, or they like particle physics, or quantum mechanics. We wanted to let them choose that.” The new Zite-powered topic-picker is the first thing you see when you start up the new Flipboard for the first time, and if you are like me, you will find it addictive. The more topics you pick — there are more than 30,000, from adventure travel to board games to mindfulness to zoology — the more diverse group of articles you will find mixed into your stream. The topic engine also pulls in “magazines” that other Flipboard users have put together. For instance, if you’re a big fan of news about 3-D printing, you might create a 3-D printing stream in Flipboard, with stories you find from across the web about your obsession. If I then choose the 3-D printing topic, I might see the stories that you have shared along with any that Flipboard’s computers have determined belong under the 3-D printing topic. “That’s the magic here,” Mr. McCue said. “It’s people’s perspectives coming together with an algorithmic curator, to create something that’s almost like a bionic curator.” That sounds high-minded and perhaps a little off-putting. But in practice the new Flipboard doesn’t feel that way, because the company has managed to conceal any potential complexity in an elegant design. As a result, Flipboard is a pleasure — a graceful, entertaining way to read the web, tailored just for you.
