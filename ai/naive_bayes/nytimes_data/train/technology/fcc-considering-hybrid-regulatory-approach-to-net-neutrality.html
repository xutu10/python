F.C.C. Considering Hybrid Regulatory Approach to Net Neutrality
A “split the baby” proposal would regulate “wholesale” Internet transactions similar to utilities, and lightly regulate transactions involving consumers.

WASHINGTON — The chairman and staff of the  The proposal is part of a hybrid solution that has gained favor among the F.C.C. staff over the last two months. Like other possible solutions, it seeks to reestablish the F.C.C.'s authority to enforce  But unlike policies previously considered, which treated the entire Internet ecosystem as a single universe, the hybrid proposal would establish a divide between “wholesale” and “retail” transactions. It would apply utilitylike regulation to the wholesale portion, the exchange of data from the content provider to the Internet service provider for passage through to the end consumer. The retail portion, the transaction that sends data through the Internet service provider to the consumer and which allows the consumer to access any legal content on the Internet, would receive a lighter regulatory touch. The hybrid proposal has not yet been circulated by the chairman or his staff to the other four commissioners, according to people close to the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the still-fluid nature of the effort. It is one of four possibilities that the F.C.C. is considering as it seeks to draw up a net neutrality framework that, unlike its last two attempts, will hold up in court. But the people said the hybrid approach has recently gained the most traction among close advisers to the chairman. A formal proposal could come as soon as next month, although people close to the discussions say that Tom Wheeler, the chairman, has suggested privately recently that the action might be pushed to the first quarter of next year. By taking a split-the-baby approach to net neutrality, the commission would seek to avoid putting consumer Internet service under a burdensome utilitylike regulatory regime. Critics of such an approach say that would discourage investment and slow the type of technological advances that have fueled the growth of online systems. However, the hybrid approach would apply Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 to the connection between Internet service providers, or I.S.P.s, and content providers. For the purpose of agreeing to transport content from a company like Netflix through its network, an I.S.P. would be treated as a “common carrier,” subject to stricter regulation. In that instance, an I.S.P., as a common carrier, could not give an unfair advantage to one content provider over another. Paid prioritization, where a content provider pays for a fast lane to consumers, would be restricted unless it could be proved to be just and reasonable. Under the hybrid approach, consumer Internet service would be governed under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which gives the F.C.C. broad powers to ensure that broadband capabilities are being deployed to all Americans “in a reasonable and timely fashion.” Taken together, those approaches would allow the F.C.C. to enforce a rule against blocking of legal Internet content, to install restrictions on discrimination among Internet traffic and still provide some allowance for unique delivery arrangements for specialized services. An F.C.C. spokeswoman declined to comment on the status of the net neutrality deliberations beyond that no decision had yet been reached. “The chairman has said that all Title II options are under serious consideration,” the spokeswoman, Kim Hart, said. The hybrid approach has been discussed with the F.C.C. by various groups, including  The other possibilities under consideration are to use Section 706 alone to oversee net neutrality; using Title II alone; or to classify Internet service as a Title II common carrier but use Section 706 to regulate. Those possibilities, however, have been judged by a growing consensus of F.C.C. members to either limit the agency’s flexibility or to be vulnerable to criticism and potentially unsupportable in court. Some consumer advocates immediately came out against the F.C.C.'s newly floated hybrid approach, which was  “The F.C.C. has already tried twice before to invent new classifications on the fly instead of clear rules grounded in the law,” Mr. Aaron said. “And twice their efforts have been rejected. This flimsy fabrication will be no different. And this approach will only serve to squander the political support of millions and millions of Americans who have weighed in at the agency asking for strong rules that will stand up in court.” Public Knowledge, another consumer group, had kinder words for policy. “Although there are many details that do not appear to have been worked out,” said Gene Kimmelman, the president of Public Knowledge, "we are confident that the proposal they’re considering could use Title II and other regulatory tools in a manner that effectively addresses the most important issues in the debate.” Mr. Kimmelman cautioned, however, that details mattered. “It is critical,” he said, “that the chairman explains how it will protect the core tenets of an open Internet that consumers expect and businesses require,” he said. “This includes, but is not limited to, explaining what sort of prioritization is allowed and if allowed, why that level of prioritization is not harmful.” Internet service providers are expected to be wary, at best, about the proposal, and AT&T;, one of the largest, said Friday on its Twitter feed that “any use of Title II would be problematic.”
