Gmail Is Blocked in China After Months of Disruption
Large numbers of Gmail web addresses were cut off and have not been restored as of Monday, a China-based freedom of speech advocacy group said.

BEIJING —  Large numbers of Gmail web addresses were cut off in China on Friday, said  “I think the government is just trying to further eliminate Google’s presence in China and even weaken its market overseas,” said a member of GreatFire.org, who uses a pseudonym because of the sensitivity of the organization’s work. “Imagine if Gmail users might not get through to Chinese clients. Many people outside China might be forced to switch away from Gmail.” Google’s own Transparency Report, which shows real-time traffic to Google services, displayed a sharp drop-off in traffic to Gmail from China on Friday. “We’ve checked and there’s nothing wrong on our end,” a Singapore-based spokesman for Google said in an email. Almost all of Google’s services have been heavily disrupted in China since June, but until last week Gmail users could still access emails downloaded via protocols like IMAP, SMTP and POP3. These had let people communicate using Gmail on apps like iPhone’s Mail and Microsoft Outlook. China maintains tight control over the Internet, nipping in the bud any signs of dissent or challenges to the ruling Communist Party’s leadership. The country is host to the world’s most sophisticated Internet censorship mechanism, known as the Great Firewall of China. Critics say China has stepped up its disruption of foreign online services like Google during the past year to create an Internet cut off from the rest of the world. The Google disruption began in the run-up to the 25th anniversary of the government’s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. One popular way for companies and people to get around China’s Internet censorship is to use a virtual private network, or V.P.N., which allows unhindered access to blocked sites and services. “It’s becoming harder and harder to connect and do work in China when services like Gmail are being blocked,” said Zach Smith, a Beijing-based digital products manager at City Weekend magazine. “Using a V.P.N. seems to be the only answer to doing anything these days online in China.”
