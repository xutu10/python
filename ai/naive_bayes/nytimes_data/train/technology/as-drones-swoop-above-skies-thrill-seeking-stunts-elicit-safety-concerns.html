As Drones Swoop Above Skies, Thrill-Seeking Stunts Elicit Safety Concerns
The antics are forcing public safety officials to look at the air above them, generally thought safe and secure, as a place for potential trouble.

Amateur photographers and Hollywood filmmakers turn to them for lush overhead shots. Geologists use them to look above the seas for oil-bearing rocks. Amazon executives are pushing to use them to plop packages onto doorsteps. But now  As the price of drones has fallen and sales have risen, the machines have emerged as central characters in stunts from the puckish to the criminal. In recent months, drone pilots have tried to smuggle contraband into prisons and disrupt sporting events at stadiums. Animal rights groups have turned to drones to stalk hunters as the hunters stalk wildlife. And in France, more than a dozen  The antics are forcing public safety officials to look at the air above them, generally thought safe and secure, as a place for potential trouble. And for groups pushing drones as legitimate business tools, the string of high jinks are an unexpected and unwelcome headache — one, they fear, that will bolster a push by regulators to keep a tight leash on the machines. The  “It’s now in the hands of all types of people – good people, bad people, tricksters, pranksters, kids,” said Patrick Egan, a consultant on commercial drone projects and editor at  For the most part, flying a drone is legal for recreational purposes, as long as operators follow a few guidelines, like staying below 400 feet. Declining prices — a four-rotor model with a mounted camera can cost as little as $500 — have attracted more buyers. Teal Group, an aerospace research firm, estimates the global civilian drone market to be worth $450 million this year, up 45 percent from last year. The machines now regularly make mundane appearances at parks and weddings, often to supply overhead photography. As the number of drones has grown, though, so has the impishness of some owners. The rise of online video and social media has motivated some operators to outdo one another. Just over a year ago, Tom Mabe, a comedian in Louisville, Ky., came up with a  “I’m hoping I’ll be the drone comic,” said Mr. Mabe, who pulled another  Outdoor sporting events, which offer open-air environments with large audiences, have become a particularly hot target. In October, a soccer match in Belgrade between the Serbian and Albanian national teams  A Serbian player yanked down the flag, which led to a scuffle among the players and rioting by fans. Drones have also buzzed professional soccer matches in Britain and college football games in the United States. In August, a student from the University of Texas at Austin was arrested after  With security concerns mounting among stadium operators, the F.A.A. recently updated a  Commercial use of drones is also largely prohibited in the United States, largely because of the perceived risks of unleashing swarms of them into the skies. A few Hollywood film companies have a  Brendan M. Schulman, a lawyer in New York who represents commercial clients interested in using drones, said the mischief comes from a few people and should not overshadow the legitimate use of drones. “It’s important for us to balance those two things,” he said, “and not curtail it just because we see a handful of people doing things that are objectionable.” Last year, drones became a potential tool in an age-old dispute. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals began offering a $325  But some say the buzzing sound of the drones is a disturbance. Nick Pinizzotto, chief executive of the U.S. Sportsmen’s Alliance, a hunter lobbying group, said he had heard from hunters in New York that a drone was used to scare off their ducks. “They always talk about, ‘We’re not trying to interrupt hunting, we’re just trying to find bad guys,' ” Mr. Pinizzotto said. “To PETA, everybody who hunts is a bad guy.” Law enforcement agencies around the country have bought drones to inspect suspicious packages and conduct surveillance, a move that has raised privacy concerns. But now the authorities are finding that drones can be used against them, too. In April, a drone crashed trying to airlift a payload of cellphones, marijuana and tobacco over the walls of a maximum-security prison, the Lee Correctional Institution in Bishopville, S.C. One man was arrested in the case, and authorities are looking for another. They are unsure whether drone operators made earlier undetected drops. Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington who studies drones, said the troublemaking should come as no surprise. “It would be the rare technology,” Professor Calo said, “that some people didn’t abuse.”
