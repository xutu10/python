Bordeaux, Decanted
Sharing insights and reactions to the inaugural wine.
===
Bordeaux is not the kind of wine most people fall for instantly. It lacks the sweet come-on that can be so seductive initially, but soon grows tiring. Instead, it’s a little austere, a bit reticent, especially when it’s young. But with time, Bordeaux reveals its many wonderful attributes. It’s a wine you learn to love. This is not to slight love at first encounter, which is my response to many different wines.  This is the second installment of Wine School, a monthly column in which together we will explore a particular type of wine. The goal is create an atmosphere of pleasure, curiosity and attentiveness to wine that will lead to understanding what you like, what you do not and why. Repeating this exercise over the course of the year will, I hope, lead to a greater sense of ease and confidence. And if you already feel comfortable, Wine School offers an opportunity to re-examine your assumptions, sharpen your observations and share your insights. The group participation this first month,  The ultimate goal, after all, is for each of us to be our own wine authority. Independence is the aim, and independent thinking about wine comes from observing and understanding your reactions. Most of the time we drink wine casually, sipping it at a party or while engrossed in conversation or the television. We may have a reflex response (“Oh, this is good!”) and leave it at that. Nothing is wrong with this approach, and nobody is obliged to do more. But if you want a deeper understanding, then carefully observing a wine like a good Bordeaux, and your response to it, is the first crucial step. This approach over time can reveal the potential heights that make so many people passionate devotees of wine, while helping you to articulate your own sense of taste. The first part of this equation requires objectivity: What is it about this wine that appeals to so many people? You may have to make a leap here — especially if you find you don’t care for it — but it’s worth doing. The second is purely subjective. Your taste is your taste, you like what you like, but keep this in mind: Tastes evolve over time. The wine you love today may not appeal to you in five years, when you may revel in a wine that today you revile. Curiosity and an open mind are vital. Listen carefully to your responses and note them, but don’t accept them as the final word. It’s often said that Bordeaux appeals to the mind while a wine like Burgundy appeals to the heart. The notion has an element of truth. Good Bordeaux may insinuate itself intellectually, but as with most wines of substance, the relationship swiftly becomes emotional. I don’t drink a lot of Bordeaux, partly because of the prices, which often makes it prohibitive in restaurants, and partly because I don’t cook a lot of red meat, with which it goes so well. But because Bordeaux and I go back decades, to my earliest years of formative wine drinking, opening a bottle now is like embracing a dear old friend. “We can’t let so much time pass before seeing each other again,” I think. The suggestion last month was to track down one of these three bottles from the Haut-Médoc appellation from the 2009 vintage:  If your wine was not one of the three I suggested, it most likely will have differed in more or less significant ways. For example, if you drank a St.-Émilion rather than a Haut-Médoc, it would probably have been a softer, easier-going, fruitier wine, mostly because it would have had a higher proportion of merlot in the blend of grapes. If you drank a different ’09 Haut-Médoc, it may have reflected different goals of the producer. I wanted examples of a classic Médoc, the region that includes exalted appellations like Pauillac, Margaux and St.-Julien as well as Haut-Médoc. This meant wines with higher proportions of cabernet sauvignon grown in the typical Médoc soil composed of gravel over clay. For centuries, this particular formula has produced Bordeaux’s singular archetypal reserved profile. Even these three wines, which come from the same general area, differ significantly, though they share similarities as well. Like all good Bordeaux, they are dry, fresh and refreshing. By that I mean they snap the palate to attention, whetting the appetite. These are not thick or powerful wines. They are graceful and they make you want to eat and drink more. For me, that is an essential quality of a good wine. Now, fine Bordeaux improves with age. Ideally, I would prefer to drink these wines in 10 years. But that doesn’t mean they can’t be enjoyed younger, particularly, as many pointed out, if they are decanted. Why decant? Science has much yet to learn about what happens to wine as it ages, but we know that exposure to minute amounts of air over years plays a role. Decanting a young wine exposes it to a lot of air in a short time. This in no way mimics aging. That is, a young wine will not develop any of the complex nuances that reward years in the cellar. But decanting will help a young, inhibited, age-worthy wine relax its tight grip on aromas and flavors, especially in an exuberant vintage like 2009, in which the wines are fairly supple. As many discovered, decanting made a big difference. Wines that seemed like clenched fists when uncorked loosened up a bit with an hour or two in the decanter, or even in the glass. One wine, the Bernadotte, was clearly different from the other two. While it had similar aromas and flavors of red fruit and earth, it was lighter, softer and less complex. Its texture was not as fine, while the flavors were less intense and more ephemeral. They disappeared quickly after swallowing. This was a very pleasant wine, but not much more than that. It was also quite a bit cheaper than the other two. Price does not always correlate with quality, but I’m afraid in the case of these three wines, the two more-expensive bottles were in another class from the easygoing Bernadotte. And while the Cantemerle and the Sociando-Mallet were fascinating, they were also quite different. As many of you who drank the Cantemerle pointed out, its initial impression was savory and herbal rather than sweetly fruity. It had an almost cedar-like quality that I love. It’s old-school Médoc. The Sociando-Mallet was lusher, with an impression of fruit and flowers leavened with earthy flavors. Both wines had great minerality, an imprecise term that tries to indicate the aromas and tactile sensation of stoniness translated into flavor. They differed in texture as well. The Sociando-Mallet had exceptionally fine, silky tannins, while the Cantemerle was a little chunkier. You could sense the grip of the tannins on your tongue and cheeks. It was not so polished. I loved them both, but maybe the Cantemerle a little more. One thing that almost everybody noticed was how much these wines change when you drink them with food. A meal seemed to pierce their innate reserve, making them convivial, “like a flower opening up in your mouth,” Janet of New York City wrote of the Cantemerle. To me, this is the magic of wine and food together. They harmonize, making each other better. Add good friends and family, and you have the perfect combination. One thing I learned: These young Bordeaux were more flexible with food than I imagined: delicious with leg of lamb, roasted chicken and risotto, three very different meals. Not everybody thought the wines changed for the better. Rob H. from Glencoe, Ill., found the Cantemerle sharp and acidic at first. With food, he said, the flavor evolved from aspirinlike to reminiscent of turpentine. Luckily, far more of you seemed to enjoy the wines. Even if you didn’t, the experience was profitable, particularly if you paid attention to what you didn’t like. Maybe you would enjoy a different Bordeaux, or a different meal, or even different company. Or maybe you just don’t like Bordeaux. Wine can be polarizing. Taste, as I said, is subjective. But could you sense what others might like about it? If I were to sum up Bordeaux’s appeal briefly, I would point to its cool, refreshing quality; its ability to change in the glass, over time and with food; its structure, which allows it to evolve with age; its complexity, which makes it fascinating to contemplate, and the sheer pleasure it can offer with food. Your next assignment: Beaujolais.
