Hotel Dining, Updated Chinese and More
Counting down the surprises in New York’s new crop of restaurants.
===
Great restaurants no longer wait for fall. Consider Bâtard and Racines NY, which both arrived in the last few months. Nonetheless, armed with my shiny new pencil case and notebook, I anticipate the fresh crop of restaurants the way I do the new theater and opera seasons. Imagine! A wine bar named for and run by Aldo Sohm, the prizewinning sommelier at Le Bernardin, with Eric Ripert unleashing his inner carnivore on a menu offering no fish whatsoever. Or the gallery mogul Larry Gagosian spending some spare change on Kappo Masa, a restaurant with the kaiseki king Masa Takayama wrangling the fish and rice. And there’s Ralph Lauren, out to replicate the fashionable splash of his restaurants in Chicago and Paris, with the Polo Bar next to his new flagship store on Fifth Avenue. I’m looking forward to digging into Sarah Simmons’s fried chicken, cleverly paired with Champagne at Birds & Bubbles. I’m curious to sample the work of the out-of-town chefs who will rotate through Chef’s Club by Food & Wine. After a few dinners at Nick Kim and Jimmy Lau’s pop-up Shuko at the Beach in East Hampton, N.Y., I’m eager to see what they’ll do on East 12th Street. And I’m ready to check out a more expansive Parm in my Upper West Side neighborhood, as well as the Parm team’s seafood restaurant alongside the new Whitney Museum at the foot of the High Line. On my to-do list: waltzing again on the revolving dance floor of the Rainbow Room; securing a table at Dirt Candy when it moves and starts taking reservations; experiencing a Manhattan version of the Brooklyn Fare tasting counter. New Yorkers will soon discover whether the Italian star chef Davide Scabin can persuade customers at Mulino a Vino to select their wines first, before the food. And whether the latest restaurant in Avery Fisher Hall will offer a good reason, other than convenience, to dine there. And that’s just this year. Beckoning in 2015, beyond the scope of this list, are a new showcase for Gabriel Kreuther, late of the Modern; ABC Home Grown from Jean-Georges Vongerichten; a Batali-Bastianich seafood restaurant replacing La Bottega in the Maritime Hotel; Le Coq Rico for chicken and other birds by the French chef Antoine Westermann; a ripe new Rouge Tomate; and maybe, just maybe, a reincarnation of L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon. In Dining Deserts, Options Now Bloom Even restaurant-clogged Manhattan has its food deserts, neighborhoods where dining destinations have been sparse for years. But as restaurateurs seek out less-expensive and less-saturated areas, a few are coming to life. Take the swath of Midtown from Murray Hill’s postgraduate bars to the lunch mills of the garment district. Sachi Asian Kitchen and Zuma, a satellite of the London-based Japanese-food chain, are moving in, joining Fabrick and Beer & Buns. The Korean barbecue chain Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong is a natural fit for the area around Koreatown. The  Lower Manhattan, now a residential as well as a financial hub, is also perking up. The highlight is the World Financial Center’s makeover into Brookfield Place, which will add a gigantic French marketplace, Le District; a version of Parm; and next year, Amada, from the prolific Philadelphia chef Jose Garces. Nearby, in Battery Park, Pier A Harbor House will have 600 seats for slurping oysters and watching sunsets across the Hudson. To the east, near South Street Seaport, Industry Kitchen will serve comfort food in a hard-edge setting with communal tables. And the more-distant future may bring a downtown Eataly. An Ancient Cuisine? Where Have You Been? RedFarm broke the mold early on. Then came Café China, China Blue, Mission Chinese Food and Fung Tu, and Chinese food in New York no longer had to strain for authenticity. Today it’s expressing a seasonal, locavore sensibility in the hands of a younger generation of hip immigrant and first-generation Asian chefs and restaurateurs who see no reason to follow the orders of General Tso. Many were trained not in Chinatown or Sunset Park, but in places like the French Culinary Institute, Per Se and Eleven Madison Park. Some restaurants have already opened: At  The fall promises more: Sachi, a pan-Asian bistro with a long list of dim sum freely tweaked by Andy Yang, will offer tomato-egg drop soup and a brown butter-miso lobster roll with yucca fries.  Not Just a Bed or Brunch The NoMad, Dirty French and many others have finally laid to rest the notion that hotel dining is strictly for tourists and Mother’s Day. Hoteliers now view a restaurant less as an extra than as an essential for drawing guests. So the season’s newcomers have glitter and clout, starting with the grandly refurbished Palm Court in the Plaza hotel, where the chef Geoffrey Zakarian has taken command of all the kitchens. In the Smyth hotel in TriBeCa, Andrew Carmellini and his partners will expand their holdings with Little Park. In the Knickerbocker Hotel in Times Square, Charlie Palmer will open three places to eat. A restaurant in the new Baccarat Hotel in Midtown will reintroduce two veterans, the manager Charles Masson Jr. and the chef Shea Gallante. And a new chain, 1 Hotels, has tapped a trifecta of big names — Jonathan Waxman, Seamus Mullen and Tom Colicchio — to head its dining rooms, respectively, in Midtown, Brooklyn and Miami. Mexican Fare Branches Out Inventive Mexican cooking may achieve a breakthrough this fall with Cosme, the first New York setting for the Mexico City chef Enrique Olvera. But more-familiar cooks are in the game, too. Alex Stupak will open his third Empellón, this one devoted to perfecting a single dish, the shawarma-style taco al pastor. At Rosie, Vicki Freeman and Marc Meyer of Cookshop will break away from American cuisine to indulge a long love affair with Mexican. Aarón Sánchez returns to the Lower East Side with Alegre and some recipes from his grandmother and his mother, the cookbook author and restaurateur Zarela Martinez. Julian Medina of Toloache is branching out with a cantina, Tacuba, in Astoria, Queens. And Jon Neidich and Jean-Marc Houmard, the duo behind the A-list magnets Indochine and Acme, will straddle Asia and Latin America at Tijuana Picnic on the Lower East Side.
