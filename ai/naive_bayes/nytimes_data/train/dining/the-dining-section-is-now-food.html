We have renamed this section, in print and online, to reflect its increasingly broad focus on food and drink, restaurants and home cooking, gastronomic trends and innovation. The new name looks forward, to coverage that extends beyond the dining room. But it looks back as well: “Food” was the name of the report Craig Claiborne edited when he joined The New York Times in 1957. It provides the foundation upon which we build today.
