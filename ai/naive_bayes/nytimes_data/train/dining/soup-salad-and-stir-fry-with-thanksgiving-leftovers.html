Soup, Salad and Stir-Fry With Thanksgiving Leftovers
Take advantage of the turkey that goes uneaten with dishes that will also serve as vehicles for other leftovers.

I love turkey sandwiches as much as the next person, but this year I have some other plans for my leftover meat: soup, salad and a stir-fry. Even better, these dishes will also serve as vehicles for other leftovers. I’ll chop up ingredients left over from a salad I’m making for  I’m also planning to use the stock I’ll make with my turkey carcass for a light, brothy, lemony soup. What I have in mind is a classic Greek avgolemono soup with turkey and the extra broccoli crown I bought for Thanksgiving but never cooked. This is one of my favorite soups, comforting but not rich. You can add other vegetables to it in addition to or besides broccoli if you’re looking for a home for them. I’ll add other remnants of leftover turkey to a stir-fry of brussels sprouts and red bell pepper. If you happen to have leftover brussels sprouts from your Thanksgiving dinner, you can use them; just know that they won’t be as crisp-tender as they would be in a classic stir-fry. Even if you start with uncooked brussels sprouts, the stir-fry is quickly accomplished because the turkey is already cooked and it’s thrown into the colorful, gingery mix at the last minute; it’s important to stir-fry only long enough to heat the turkey through, or it will dry out too much. Light is the theme here. That’s what we want after Thanksgiving, as we head into the holidays.
