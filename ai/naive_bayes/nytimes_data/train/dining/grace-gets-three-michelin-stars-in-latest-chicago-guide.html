Grace Gets Three Michelin Stars in Latest Chicago Guide
The restaurant, barely two years old, joins Alinea as Chicago three-star winners.

Grace, a Chicago restaurant barely two years old, has just been awarded three stars from the Michelin Guide. It is only the second restaurant in the city to claim that distinction, joining Alinea. Last month, Michelin gave three stars to Benu and Saison in San Francisco, the first in that city, although two Napa Valley restaurants, the French Laundry in Yountville and the restaurant at Meadowood in St. Helena, have long had three stars in the annual rankings. That brings to 12 the number of restaurants in Michelin’s top category in the entire country in the 2015 guides, with six of those  The Michelin Guides to hotels and restaurants in the United States are published only for New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Curtis Duffy, the chef and an owner of Grace, is from Columbus, Ohio. He worked at Charlie Trotter’s and was chef de cuisine at Alinea when it opened in 2004. Like nearly all of the American three-star restaurants, Grace serves only tasting menus, with a choice of either “flora” (vegetable-based) or “fauna” (with meat, fish and poultry). Also in Chicago, 42 Grams earned two stars. L20 and Sixteen retained their two-star rankings. It makes you wonder whether you have to have a number in your restaurant’s name to win two stars from Michelin in Chicago. In San Francisco, Benu’s owner and chef is Corey Lee, a former chef de cuisine at the French Laundry. A native of Seoul, he grew up in the New York area. He opened his serenely elegant, Asian-inflected restaurant in 2010. Saison, owned by Joshua Skenes, also serves an elaborate tasting menu. Pete Wells of The New York Times  Mr. Skenes, who is from Jacksonville, Fla., and has worked mostly in San Francisco since 2003, started Saison as a pop-up. Aquarello in San Francisco was awarded two stars in the 2015 guide, joining Atelier Crenn, Baumé, Coi, Manresa and Quince.
