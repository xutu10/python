Mark Bittman Adds London Restaurants to His Favorites List
On a trip to London last spring, Mark Bittman ate at Restaurant Story, Chiltern Firehouse, Gymkhana and Barnyard

LONDON — More or less chronologically, my favorite restaurant towns of the last 20 years have been New York, Paris, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and now,  I don’t know what caused London to surge to the front. It may be a genuine appreciation for pedigree ingredients that predates ours and isn’t as precious; Londoners have been celebrating the arrival of asparagus and Jersey potatoes not for the last three years but for centuries. It may be that there is a broader palate: no one thinks twice about putting kidneys or brains or truly wild, highly flavorful grouse on the menu. It may be that London, of course a capital of world finance, is also a more fun city than perhaps any other, as long as you have money. It may be that, relatively speaking, the wine is cheap, mostly French, and therefore usually good even if you don’t know what you’re doing. (With the pound sterling at $1.70, nothing is actually cheap, not even breakfast.) And it may be that I’m just in love with the place, and have been for 46 years, since I went there as a 17-year-old and, in a light snowstorm in midwinter, visited Covent Garden, then still a year-round outdoor produce market. Even more pathetic, it may be that I speak the language and I love the accent. I may also be wrong. But on a trip last spring I managed to eat at four of the newest and most-heralded restaurants, and came away excited. I returned to three of them twice in the course of the same trip, not because I intended to write about them (this was supposed to be a recreational visit), but because I liked them so much. Unlike a New York Times critic, I made the reservations in my own name and the kitchens saw me coming, in the sense that they knew who I was and what I do for a living. I paid for my meals, of course, but some chefs weren’t above sending out the occasional free dish. Chiltern Firehouse is the sole restaurant where I ate only once, and that’s more because it’s not my style than anything else. The restaurant is in a renovated firehouse on a classic red brick block in Marylebone, a block as sweet as you’ll ever see. The place is swank and filled with celebs; I suppose it goes without saying that you will have trouble getting in. (I did, and it had just opened.) It’s bright and glossy and loud, and if the weather is good you should sit outside, where the people-watching is just as good. The chef is Nuno Mendes, who has cooked his way through at least a couple of Michelin three-star chefs, and most recently ran a pair of highly acclaimed restaurants in the Town Hall Hotel in Bethnal Green. If you can get past all the glitter, you will find vegetables treated as respectfully as animals. Planks of sweetly caramelized roasted celeriac are served with walnuts, onions and greens, and though one would hardly argue that these are as killer as the wood-grilled rib-eye (served with chimichurri, which is the new pesto, I guess), they are plenty satisfying. Chargrilled Ibérico pork with collards and roasted garlic is difficult to write about without my mouth watering. A starter of roasted cauliflower in mayonnaise is sadly no longer on the menu. Grilled octopus with eggplant is, however, and I would grab that. On the other end of the spectrum and on the other side of Oxford Street (in Fitzrovia), is Barnyard, equally contrived but less pretentious, tricked out to look like a cartoonish farm, all wood and fake fence and raw wood chairs and tables, and flannel-shirted overly friendly servers. (Did they go to the Midwest for training?) Barnyard is the latest iteration of technically precise and easily devoured food served in an almost absurdly funky atmosphere. Ollie Dabbous, who runs the nearby Dabbous, ostensibly the most important opening of 2012, is involved here. But the star would appear to be the unassuming chef Joe Woodland, who worked for three years at the Square, one of the most reliable restaurants in London over the last quarter-century, and seems as down-to-earth as Barnyard pretends to be. Mr. Woodland has organized the menu by ingredient (“egg”; “cow”), and to start at the end, I could just say that everyone orders the popcorn ice cream and you should, too. To begin, there is a broken egg (pretty much raw) with mushrooms, garlic and parsley; eat this with a spoon. Roast suckling pig with celeriac and caraway reminded me of something I had at a Ducasse restaurant 10 years ago and talked about for weeks. All of the food is lighthearted and not meant to be taken too seriously, except when it’s so successful that it simply must be. There are a lot of exotic drinks, including shakes that you can start or finish with, and add alcohol to or not. Gymkhana (a word that might mean a sports meet, or maybe a men’s club, at least during the Raj), in Mayfair, is probably the most celebrated opening of last year, and probably the most ambitious “Indian” restaurant in town. It’s the second establishment of the Britain-born Karam Sethi, whose first venture, Trishna, is still going strong. Gymkhana is dark and clubby and mostly underground. It’s meant to feel somewhat posh but can come across as an old, tired London, until you get a look at the menu. You could start with snacks or appetizers like the duck egg bhurji with lobster, but focus on main courses. Many of the meats are game — quail kebabs, deer, muntjac (deer-like), partridge — and are treated with a heavy hand, spiced hard and well, like the wood pigeon-pepper stir-fry, my favorite. But the signature dishes are the vegetables, especially the tandoori broccoli (imagine) and beet kebabs. Pilaus and biriyanis are light and flavorful; I have had their equal only in India. Oh, suckling pig vindaloo. And little eggplants. My favorite place was Restaurant Story, which you’ll find near Tower Bridge. It’s people like 27-year-old Tom Sellers who will make you believe in the “talented young chef” myth. Of course, if you cook at Per Se when you’re 21 and Noma when you’re 25, you have a pretty good head start, but it isn’t easy to work at those places unless you’re a talented young chef. Story is a special-occasion restaurant, and perfect for lunch, because the light is dazzling in this spare, minimalist room with so many windows. There are six- and 10-course tasting menus and more food than you want on both. The bill for the 10-course meal is £85, or a bit more than $140, and worth it. (I said this was a special-occasion restaurant, didn’t I?) I tasted pretty much everything the kitchen was producing in April and there were only a couple of dishes that didn’t wow me; the food is precise, gorgeous, wildly varied in flavors and textures and only occasionally over the top. There’s a course in which the drippings from the beef-tallow candle that’s been lighting your table are meant to be sopped up with bread. I enjoyed it (it needed salt), but it’s too clever by half. Still, the descriptions don’t describe the food’s complexity: cod skin with cod roe emulsion; radishes stuffed with seaweed butter; blackened onion with apple and gin, garnished with a variety of onionlike things; scallops with cucumber and dill ash. There was eggplant covered with a mélange of vegetables in aspic that was so beautiful I nearly gasped, and an Oreo-like sandwich of squid-ink biscuit filled with smoked eel mousse. There was a desert of lemon and milk concoctions: lemon curd, lemon parfait, lemon verbena, pickled lemon, confit lemon, lemon snow, milk ice cream and milk skin. I could have eaten it twice. And almost none of this (except for the tallow drippings!) is on the current menu. Trust the kitchen and enjoy. There may be a few cities you could put together a few days of eating like that one, and most of them, as far as I know, are in the United States. But you’re not going to get the accent in any of them.
