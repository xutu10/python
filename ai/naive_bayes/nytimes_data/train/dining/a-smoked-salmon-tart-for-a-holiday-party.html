A Smoked Salmon Tart for a Holiday Party
Smoked salmon and caviar show what a sophisticated holiday host you are.

For a glamorous holiday, hop on a plane to Paris, and then stroll along any street. In every neighborhood, twinkling lights are strung in breathtaking displays. Every shop glitters, from the smallest pâtisserie to the fanciest department store. And all the high-end edibles are given pride of place, ready to be wrapped up for home consumption. Smoked salmon, caviar and foie gras are all considered festive fare, most suitable for winter gatherings, impromptu or otherwise. These items are also given as gifts and no doubt will come out of the fridge for another party during the season, along with a bottle of Champagne. This exemplifies the French penchant for pleasure. Who wouldn’t want to come in from the dreary cold for a glass of Champagne and a bite of something luxurious? Clearly, we can learn from this example and bring the custom stateside. Or at least in part. While caviar is a wonderful splurge, few have the budget to serve it in great quantities. (If you know someone who does, snag an invitation.) Foie gras is not controversial in France the way it is here — it may not be welcome at some American parties, delicious though it may be. So perhaps we’ll pass on those. Smoked salmon, on the other hand, is more affordable; everyone loves it, and a little goes a long way as a cocktail snack. It’s delicious on buttered rye or baguette toasts, or served on Belgian endive leaves. But for a cocktail snack that exudes elegance, a smoked salmon tart is extremely impressive and nearly as easy. Cut into wedges, it looks like an upscale pizza, but the crust is essentially a large buttery homemade cracker. Spread with horseradish-enhanced crème fraîche, this tart is easy to assemble and even easier to eat. The pastry rounds may be baked ahead and left at room temperature. Then it’s simply a matter of topping them as needed with ribbons of smoked salmon and a sprinkling of chives, tarragon or dill. Oh, back to caviar. You don’t actually have to break the bank if you skip the pricey sturgeon caviar and use high-quality French pale orange trout roe or bright vermilion wild salmon caviar instead. A little spoonful as a splashy garnish for each serving can be awfully good. Be mindful of the pleasure principle. Let the eggs pop on your tongue as you reach for another slice.
