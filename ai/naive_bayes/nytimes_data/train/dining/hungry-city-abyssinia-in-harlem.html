Hungry City: Abyssinia in Harlem
At Abyssinia in Harlem, the flatbread does the heavy lifting with the Ethiopian dishes.
===
The description “ground mildly spiced chickpeas” does not prepare you for what arrives, which looks less like a self-sufficient dish than a sauce or a displaced soup, as red as the desert. It’s not that mild, either, thanks to a nice shock of berbere, an Ethiopian spice blend dominated by red chile, with gentler warming notes from cinnamon, cardamom and cloves. This is shiro, a staple of the Ethiopian table, unglamorous and essential. Of all the entrees at  Ms. Reta grew up in Ethiopia’s northern highlands, in the holy city of  Traditional injera is tricky to replicate in New York, and Ms. Reta suspects this is because of differences in the water. She has adapted by adding a little wheat flour and barley to the batter before leaving it to ferment for three days. The result, riddled with tiny sinkholes, is spongy yet strong enough not to disintegrate under the juices of the many dishes poured on top. These may include innocent-looking red lentils ready to self-combust; cabbage with an invisible tattoo of garlic; chicken drumsticks and a hard-boiled egg under a black shroud of berbere and onions cooked to near liquidity; lamb steeped in awaze, a berbere-fueled marinade, then further agitated by jalapeños; beef mellowed with ginger and turmeric, offering a curry’s warmth to parry the other dishes’ chile heat. It’s hard to single out dishes for recognition since they come in ensembles, your and your companions’ orders delivered in neighborly heaps along the circumference of one vast injera. But kitfo deserves the center spot: top round of beef chopped, ground and saturated with niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter) and mitmita, a small firestorm of African bird’s-eye chiles. It is typically served raw, but you may order it leb leb, seared just enough to seethe. Extra injera is supplied on the side, to use for scooping and pinching mouthfuls of food; do it right and your fingers may remain unstained and unsticky the entire evening. (If not, don’t lick them. It’s considered rude.) Desserts are not an Ethiopian tradition. Accordingly, the menu lists only one, carrot cake, which was never available on my visits. Better to end with tej, a fermented drink that goes back several millenniums, made of honey brewed with gesho, a species of buckthorn whose bitterness offsets the honey’s sweetness. Of the three varieties of tej listed on Abyssinia’s menu, which aren’t always available, Saba is the one that persuades. Poured, it looks like low-grade maple syrup. I thought it would be too sweet, and it was, but then it turned, slowly, and finished buttery and round. It had the body of unfiltered sake and tasted like a less frivolous, more grown-up moscato. Abyssinia’s dining room is modest, with few cultural markers apart from a stringless kirar, a lyre-like instrument, and woven baskets atop a refrigerator case. The floor and ceiling are the kind of bland tile that calls to mind a fried-chicken outlet, which the space once was. The lack of ostentation feels reassuring. And there are gestures toward décor: twinkle lights in the windows, white tablecloths and vases of dainty plastic flowers. The woman who watches over you, hostess and server in one, is patient, benevolent and seemingly untroubled by the passage of time. You learn to be, too.
