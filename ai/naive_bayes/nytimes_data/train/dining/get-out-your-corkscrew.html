Get Out Your Corkscrew
Come join us as we set out to drink and discuss a different type of wine each month.
===
Wine School, a monthly column, invites you to drink wine with Eric Asimov. In each installment, Mr. Asimov chooses a type of wine for you to try at home.  You don’t have to know much about wine to enjoy it. But if you become interested in wine and want to examine it more closely, your pleasure will deepen. What was merely satisfying becomes rewarding and, occasionally, even profound. This is the goal of the Wine School, which begins today: to help create an atmosphere of pleasure, attentiveness and curiosity about wine that will lead to knowing what you like, what you do not and why. I hope you will join me in the coming months to drink some wine together. Gaining an understanding of your own taste leads to a sense of ease and confidence. This is perhaps the biggest step in overcoming whatever it is in the culture of wine that causes so many to feel intimidated and inadequate. If you are already comfortable with wine, participating in the Wine School offers the opportunity to sharpen your observations, re-examine your assumptions and share your insights. I’m sure I will learn a few things. One of the great pleasures of wine is that your education never ends. Here’s how it will work: Each month I will pick a type of wine we will explore together. I will suggest three representative examples of that wine, and if you want to join me, I hope you will be able to find at least one of those bottles. If they are not at your wine shop,  Over the next few weeks, we will drink the wine, and share  This is an exercise in drinking the wines, not tasting them. The difference is important. Tasting is something professionals do as a way to gain a quick sense of a large number of wines. It means spitting out the wine rather than swallowing it, simply to maintain one’s health and equilibrium. It also demands a certain level of experience, because tasting requires a great deal of extrapolation. Based on a quick sample, a taster must predict how that wine will age, how it will taste with food as it evolves, how it will change with exposure to air. In short, tasting a wine involves guessing how that bottle will be experienced under actual conditions of drinking it. It’s an essential compromise that professionals must make. We’ll eliminate the guesswork by drinking the wine. This will offer far more pleasure and a more complete picture because good wines are alive. They don’t just change as they age, they change in a glass over the length of a meal. How you experience the wine will be affected by what you eat with it. Even the weather and your emotions have a role. The same wine will tell vastly different stories on a snowy winter night and a hot summer evening. It will present a different side if you are relaxed and happy, rather than tense and agitated. With great wines, which can age and evolve for years, even drinking one bottle may not be enough for the entire story. In these instances, a case of the wine is better, because it allows you to understand the wine at different points in its evolution. But the idea here is to pay attention to the wine simply over the course of a meal: to enjoy it, certainly, but also to understand your experience. You will note how the wine presents itself before you begin to eat, and then with food; how the first glass may differ from the second, whether it changes in the glass, and if so, how. You will want to say something about the aroma and how it tastes, but don’t overanalyze. All the vaunted clichés of tasting notes, the genre of writing that traffics in hints of cloudberries, guava, melted road tar, fig compote and so on, actually communicate very little to other people about the experience of drinking that wine. I’ve found that a more general approach conveys far more. That is, does the wine seem sweetly fruity, no matter what kind of fruit? Or does it seem savory, tasting more of herbal, smoky, stony or acidic flavors? Maybe it’s a combination. I once suggested that  Just as important as the smells and flavors of the wine is the texture, that is, how it feels in your mouth. I find texture to be a crucial yet undervalued quality, possibly because words that describe this tactile sense are even more elusive than those used for what is detected by your eyes, nose and taste buds. I think of texture in terms of its primary components, tannins and acidity. Tannins play a greater role in red wines. They are the somewhat astringent compounds derived not only from the skins, stems and seeds of grapes but also sometimes from the wood of the barrels in which the wines were aged. No doubt, we will encounter tannins in our exploration of Bordeaux. Acidity is the juicy, zingy quality that can be felt more easily than tasted. Too much, and a wine can be harsh and aggressive. Too little, and it may feel flabby and shapeless. Acidity can also change during the winemaking process from the crispness of malic acids to softer lactic acids. In some wines, the presence of glycerol, a product of fermentation that is heavy and oily, can also be felt. To me, a wonderful texture expresses itself as a snappy vivacity that almost compels you to take another sip because the wine feels so good in the mouth. All this is to say that as pleasurable as the Wine School will be, it will also require a modest bit of work. By whatever method you choose, whether pen and paper, computer or smartphone, simply record your reactions to the wine. Describe the general aromas, flavors and texture before you begin eating, and then later during the meal. Did they change? Become more nuanced, or perhaps harder to detect? Did serving temperature affect the wine? If so, contrast its character when it was cool to when it warmed up. How did your meal affect the wine? And anything else that strikes you as noteworthy. The purpose is to retain a sense of the wine and its association with a particular meal. With time and experience, especially when you pay attention, you will develop a sense of what you like and what you don’t and why. How long does that take? It depends on how often you drink wine and how carefully you choose to observe the wine and your reaction to it. Few things happen immediately. So let us begin. Here are the first three bottles and what I paid for them (remember prices vary; be sure you find the same wine, not a second label, in the same size bottle): CH CH CH No, these are not inexpensive wines. But in the rarefied world of Bordeaux, they are moderately priced. Why begin in such a pricey region? Because for centuries, Bordeaux has defined much of what we take for granted about fine wine today. Not so long ago, it was a place where those devoted to wine began their exploration and where they ended up. Nowadays, we have far more options, and Bordeaux in many ways has made itself far less accessible to many people. But I believe Bordeaux is at the very least worth the expense because it still has much to deliciously teach us. And at best, Bordeaux still offers soaring pleasures. I don’t expect anybody to buy all three bottles. Any one will do, though if you can find more than one and want to try it, by all means do. And if you can’t find any of these but still want to join in, look for any 2009 from the Haut-Médoc, the region where these wines originated. More exalted areas of the Médoc include famous names like Pauillac, St.-Julien and Margaux. The Haut-Médoc allows us a sense of those wines while trying to be budget-minded. As for the meal, I recommend simplicity. Lamb and beef are classic matches. Duck and even roast chicken would be good, too. But for these Bordeaux, try to avoid extravagant adornments. A last word: Don’t worry about glassware. Good stemmed glasses are great to have, but not essential. Even if all you have are juice glasses, don’t fret. It’s the wine itself, and your reactions, that are most important.
