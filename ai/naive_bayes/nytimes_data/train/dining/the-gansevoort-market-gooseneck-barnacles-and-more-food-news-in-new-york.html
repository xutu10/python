To Tackle: A Rare Delicacy to Steam and Enjoy Among the strangest sea creatures to enjoy are gooseneck barnacles, a delicacy in Spain, where they are called percebes. The rare barnacles are sometimes imported from Spain and Portugal, but they’re available now from Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, where the Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation tribe is allowed to harvest 1,000 pounds a month. The barnacles have a scaly black and white mottled shell at one end, from which extends a rubbery tubular “neck,” like those on soft-shell steamer clams. Steam them for about five minutes, and then it’s easy to break the tube, pull it off and expose the delicate pink meat inside. Eat the meat with a dip of some kind, an aioli perhaps:  To Slice: A Knife Ideal for Bartenders This new bar knife, with a sharp, squared-off blade and a tropical hardwood handle, is a joy to hold. Designed by Jackson Cannon, the owner of the Hawthorne, a bar in Boston, it is based on a leather-cutting knife once used in the shoe industry and made by R. Murphy Knives, an artisanal company in Ayer, Mass. It’s an ideal tool for citrus fruits, making easy work of slicing off strips of peel, notching a wheel as a garnish and flipping out any pits. The high-carbon stainless steel blade resists acid staining: To Save Time: Al Dente Pasta in 90 Seconds The pasta company Rustichella d’Abruzzo had Futurism in mind, with its emphasis on speed, when it devised its new spaghetti, Rapida, that cooks in 90 seconds. It’s really a spaghettini. Each strand is scored along its length so boiling water penetrates faster. (The company has patented a bronze die to manufacture the pasta.) It works: 90 seconds give excellent al dente results, and when cooked, the split in each strand is not evident. Shaving six minutes or so from the cooking time will certainly be a boon for restaurants. For the home cook, those sauce ingredients better be ready before the pasta goes into the pot. Now if only they could figure out how to boil four quarts of water in 90 seconds:  To Browse: Food and Goodies at Gansevoort Market Add another food hall to the city’s growing collection. The 8,000-square-foot Gansevoort Market, in the meatpacking district, is opening in stages in a former storage space with garage doors. The market will eventually be home to about two dozen stands. Among those ready now are Donostia for Basque tapas; Ed’s Lobster Bar; Champion Coffee from Greenpoint, Brooklyn; Dojo Express by Sushi Dojo in the East Village; the Pig Guy; FeelFood for sandwiches and salads; and Flower Girl, a florist. There’s also a skylit area with seating:  To Learn: In the Bronx, a Class on Butchery Boots and a sweater are required gear for this 2 1/2-hour class on butchering, given in a wholesale meat locker kept at 34 degrees. It’s run by Mosner Family Brands, a venerable New York butcher now in the Hunts Point market. It includes a demonstration on how various animals are broken down, and hands-on butchering. Each student leaves with about eight pounds of meat. The next class is Dec. 6:  To Design: An Apron to Wear or Give as a Gift If you’re looking for a professional-grade apron, Chef-Shop by Tilit Chef Goods, known for its roomy, heavy-duty aprons, will customize one in 15 minutes. It is setting up a workshop in the former Florent space and will make aprons, first come first served, on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Fabrics include denim and wax cloth, and the hem, straps and pocket placement will be done to order. If they can’t make your dream apron on the spot, it can be delivered the next week. Think holiday gifts:
