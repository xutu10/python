Headliner FLORIAN Shelly Fireman has several restaurants near Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. With this venture, he has moved downtown, to the former Wildwood Barbeque space off 19th Street. He hopes it will attract a different clientele for his brand of jazzy Italian food, including the lavish antipasto for which some of his restaurants are known. There is a 12-seat burrata bar, with twists on the mozzarella specialty like carbonara-style filled with egg, and a 200-seat dining room. Dishes include osso buco lasagna, carrot-polenta fries and pizza. The chef is Brando de Oliveira. There is plenty of marble, tile and leather, and imposing bronze statues that Mr. Fireman created in Tuscany, where he has a home:  Opening CAMPAGNA DESSERT CLUB BY CHIKALICIOUS MASTRO’S STEAKHOUSE PLAZA FOOD HALL Closings THE HARRISON L’ABSINTHE WILLOW ROAD
