In Umbria, an Italian Olive Oil Worth the Accolades
Umbrian oil makes up only about 2 percent of Italy’s olive oil production but wins a far larger proportion of awards.

SPELLO, Italy — Most people go to the Enoteca Properzio wine shop and restaurant in this medieval Umbrian hill town to sample its fine selection of wines. But we were a pretty sober group. The Thai artist was a teetotaler; the American novelist was the designated driver. The Iranian-American painter and the Mongolian poet were amateurs when it came to drink. Only the Brazilian-American sculptor in our touring group of six had an unquenchable thirst. So after downing three wines that had been matched up with three courses, we moved on to another liquid: olive oil. And that’s where Nadia Antonelli Franceschini came in. Ms. Antonelli Franceschini and her husband, Augusto, make an extra-virgin olive oil called Cuore Verde, using only young moraiolo olives that they grow on small plots of land on the gentle hills around Spello. The enoteca sells and serves it. Ms. Antonelli Franceschini poured some of the thick green-gold oil into a glass shaped like a large blue marble with an opening on top. She warmed the glass in her hand and tapped it three times to release the oil’s perfume, then passed it around. “You should feel piquant on the tip of your tongue and bitter deep in your throat,” she said. “It is full of antioxidants that make it aggressive. You are not in the sweetness of Tuscany here.” Ms. Antonelli Franceschini, a retired Alitalia flight attendant, and her husband, a philosopher by training, are militant defenders of Umbrian olive oil. At a time when much of the “extra-virgin Italian olive oil” flooding the world’s markets is neither Italian nor virginal, Mr. Antonelli Franceschini presides over a consortium of the region’s olive oil producers that recognizes authentic Umbrian organic oil with a stamp of excellence: D.O.P., for “protection of origin.” Every D.O.P. bottle is numbered, with a recommended deadline date for consumption. I thought I knew from olive oil. My father sold a dozen brands of imported extra-virgin olive oil at his Italian grocery store in Niagara Falls, N.Y. Long before the Mediterranean diet became chic, he told his customers that olive oil trumped butter on pasta, bread and green vegetables and even in most pastries. The best Christmas present he could give me, once I grew up, was a case of four one-gallon tins of his best brand. When I was posted to Rome as Newsweek’s bureau chief in the 1980s, I lived in an apartment that had belonged to the film star  But here I was in Spello, confronted with an oil that was not for the timid of tongue. If Cuore Verde were a movie star, it would be  Umbrian oil makes up only about 2 percent of Italy’s olive oil production but wins a far larger proportion of awards. It begged for further investigation. So when I drove an hour southwest to visit a friend in Acqualoreto, she took me to meet Pietro Marruco, 30, who with nine other investors had built a state-of-the-art olive oil mill for $1 million to service olive growers from all over the region. Mr. Marruco is determined to keep his oils, which are sold under a number of names, traditional, local and pure. All of his olives come from within 20 miles of the mill. He curses the companies that have given Italian olive oil a bad name. “The big groups have killed our market and our reputation,” he said. “My passion is making beautiful oils that very few people make.” The mill mainly handles three types of olives — moraiolo (intense), leccino (prolific) and frantoio (sweet) — which are washed, crushed into paste, pressed into oil and stored in huge stainless steel vats infused with nitrogen to keep oxygen out. Hundreds of dark bottles stood empty in a storage room; they are filled with oil only when it is ready to be shipped. Mr. Marruco prides himself on the diversity of his oils. “Leccino and frantoio are soft and sweet, like a very likable woman,” he said. “Moraiolo is a hard, strong woman, a rock.” I preferred the rock. I also preferred Spello, with its crumbling stone walls, winding streets and peach-colored marble buildings. So I returned here and called on Mario Ciampetti, owner of the Hispellum farm, who produces more olive oil than the Antonelli Franceschinis and is the only producer in Spello with his own mill. His Terre Rosse oil is sold abroad, including in Sweden, China and the United States. “My ambition is not to sell the most oil all over the world,” Mr. Ciampetti said. “It’s to sell my oil to those who appreciate the taste of Umbria in their plate.” Like Cuore Verde, his oil is made only from young, organically grown moraiolo olives; it is also kosher. More delicate than Cuore Rosse, it retains what Mr. Ciampetti calls “the same strong moraiolo personality: spicy and bitter, but not sweet.” He showed me the remains of a medieval monastery ringed with olive trees, explaining that papal documents from the 12th century attest to the existence of olive trees there. He said mature trees produce better olives. “Like the wise man who gets wiser as he gets older, the taste of the oil improves with the age of the tree,” he said. The Antonelli Franceschinis, meanwhile, were eager to match Mr. Ciampetti’s hospitality. So they invited me to dinner at their vast Renaissance-era palazzo in the heart of Spello. The museum-quality paintings and ceiling frescoes were rivaled only by the surprises on the table: two dishes prepared with risina beans, tiny black-eyed peas that Mr. Antonelli Franceschini had helped rescue from extinction in Italy. The bean is believed to have been cultivated near Lake Trasimeno by the anceint Romans or Etruscans. It fell into oblivion in the mid-20th century. One day, an agronomist for the Umbria region approached him with a bottle of seeds. “He said he trusted me to do something good with them,” Mr. Antonelli Franceschini recalled. “I reproduced them for four years, and in the fifth year, I harvested 200 kilos of risina.” Ms. Antonelli Franceschini explained that the bean is not really a bean, but a pea called Vigna unguiculata, a cowpea. She said that unlike most dried legumes, it does not have to be soaked in advance. The beans are barely covered with warm water (cold water will make the skins hard) then gently simmered for about 50 minutes. The first dish she served was a smoked swordfish, arugula and risina bean salad. That was followed by jumbo Adriatic shrimps still in their shells that were accompanied by risina beans prepared with bits of chopped cherry tomatoes. The couple sell risina and other legumes in elegant boxes under the Cuore Verde label. The next day, we hit mostly winding, rocky dirt roads up and down hills to tour their olive groves. Along the way, they gave me some basic olive oil lessons. One: The worst oil in the world is bottled in clear glass. Two: Storing oil in a tin once it has been opened will give it a cucumber taste. Three: Avoid olive oil with a low price; a $5-a-liter bottle is likely to lack flavor. From there we trekked through long grass to visit the bean fields, which were in flower. Among the legumes were Umbrian green lentil and baby chickpea, and more unusual varieties like a wild pea named roveja and a squared peasant bean that looks like a small pebble called cicerchia. And of course, risina. “We don’t know how to sell.” Ms. Antonelli Franceschini said. “But we do know how to grow.” At that moment, I wished that my father were still alive, so I could send him a box of risina beans.
