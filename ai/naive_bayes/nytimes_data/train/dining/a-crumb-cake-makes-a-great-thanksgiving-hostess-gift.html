A Sweet Crumb Cake for Your Thanksgiving Hostess
Bring along this decadent offering with honeyed pears that can compete with leftover pie.

One of the nicest hostess gifts I ever received at a dinner party was a jar of homemade marmalade and a brown paper bag full of biscuits, which my husband and I devoured the next morning as we cleaned up the mess. Since then, I’ve taken breakfast to many a party, either homemade or thoughtfully purchased. Consider baked goods, cultured butter and artisanal jam if you want to be decadent, or granola, fancy yogurt and exotic fruit for something on the lighter side. When it comes to  This tender crumb cake makes a luxuriously sweet breakfast and can be baked a day or two ahead. It’s filled with honeyed pears, but feel free to substitute about a cup of any gently cooked and lightly sweetened fruit: apples, fuyu persimmon, quince, pineapple, blueberries, plums, peaches, grapes or even cranberry sauce. If you happen to have a jar of chestnut honey or other intense honey, this is a good place to use it. And don’t just bake this for the day after Thanksgiving. Take it to any dinner party, and you will be invited back.
