Food & Wine Magazine Inspires Chefs Club Restaurant
Chefs Club by Food & Wine will bring a rotating roster of guest chefs to Manhattan.

Headliner  CHEFS CLUB BY FOOD & WINE Well-known out-of-town chefs will begin rotating through this new restaurant and contributing dishes to the menu. The concept was started last year in Aspen, Colo., with “best new chefs” selected by Food & Wine magazine. Gabriel Rucker of Le Pigeon in Portland, Ore., will be one of the first. “I’m never going to open a restaurant in New York, but this allows me to bring what I do at Le Pigeon here,” Mr. Rucker said. Other chefs include Linton Hopkins of Restaurant Eugene in Atlanta; Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson of Frasca Food & Wine in Boulder, Colo.; and Erik Anderson of Brut in Minneapolis. Menus will be coordinated by Didier Elena, the executive chef for the project. David Rockwell designed an open space dominated by a giant kitchen, with communal tables in marble and wood, some of them abutting the work surfaces. A bar stretches along one side, with clever cooking-as-art pieces throughout, like the boulder of salt, right. Portraits of chefs, sketched by an artist who was discovered in Central Park, cover one wall.
