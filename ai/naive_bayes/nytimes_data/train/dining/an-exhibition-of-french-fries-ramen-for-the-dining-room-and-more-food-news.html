To Visit: Yes, We’ll Have Fries With That You love them, but you take them for granted. Now you can study French fries up close and personal in a pop-up exhibit that displays 100 of them from a variety of New York restaurants. It was organized by Sir Kensington’s, a condiment maker. Scott Norton, a founder of the company, said Guild, a design collective, gathered fries from local places — don’t look for McDonald’s here — and coated each sample with clear resin. “We wanted to show the diversity of these things that are ubiquitous and how they have changed with new American and fusion cuisines,” he said. There is a history of fries, and accouterments like truffle oil and herbs:  To Slurp: From the Dorm Room to the Dining Room Most of the better ramen shops, including Ivan Ramen, buy noodles from Sun Noodle, a company in Teterboro, N.J., that makes different varieties to meet chefs’ specifications. Sun has introduced fresh ramen kits so you can make them at home. Boil the noodles for a minute or so, mix the soup packet with hot water, add your own embellishments like mushrooms, scallions, egg, greens and so forth, and you have a satisfying bowl of ramen that’s far superior to the dorm room offering. It comes in two varieties, shoyu, which is soy-based, and miso, which is richer and spicier:  To Slice: Black Bread Just Like Archimedes Used to Eat Nicola Accardi, the owner of Tavola restaurant, has realized his dream of reproducing the pane nero, or black bread from Sicily, that his grandfather made in Castelvetrano. It’s made with tumminia, an ancient wheat flour grown only in that region and said to have been cultivated by the Greeks who settled on the island. The bread is called black because of the darkness of the crust. At Tavola, the sourdough loaves are baked in an oven fueled with olive wood and emerge dense, with an alluring touch of sweetness suggesting cornmeal. They keep well and toast or grill beautifully:  To Savor: Even Better News if You Love Truffles This season is even better for white truffle lovers than last year, when the supply from Italy was plentiful and prices good. At Locanda Verde, white truffle entrees are $50 each, $35 for appetizer and desserts, through Dec. 15. A lavish white truffle dinner, with truffles and shavers on the tables so you can serve yourself, will be held Nov. 19 at SD26, $350 including wines, taxes and tips. And to indulge at home, BuonItalia has them, starting at $100 an ounce. It is holding a truffle tasting Nov. 19 and 20 from 6 to 9 p.m.:  To Enrich: Intoxicating Apricots in an Intense Liqueur This amber liqueur has a penetrating aroma of pure apricots with a flavor to match. It is made by Merlet, a French company, in the time-honored fashion of macerating fresh apricots from southwest France in neutral spirits, then blending with good brandy and crushed apricot pits. It may be too intense to sip straight, but try a splash in a glass of sparkling wine, swap it for the Drambuie in a Rusty Nail or flame it over crêpes suzette made with apricot jam:
