Bars Opening Soon in New York
This fall, rooftop, basement and vault are among the sites of the city’s new drinking dens.

The demise of one of last fall’s splashiest new bars, the 1970s-themed Golden Cadillac, has created a sort of downtown drinking diaspora. Most of its partners are back in the same space with a new venture, Boilermaker; one, Greg Boehm, is also opening an East Village saloon, Mace, while the former Cadillac barman Giuseppe Gonzalez will unveil Suffolk Arms just blocks away. Three live bars for one dead one? Pretty good bargain, I’m thinking. Elsewhere, the new Yours Sincerely in Bushwick, Brooklyn, will take the barrel-aged cocktail trend to its furthest extreme to date, while hotels — which continue to up their cocktail game — are making certain you can drink well both on the roof (Bar Hugo) or in the basement (Bar Below Kitchen & Bank Vault). And beer gardens continue to proliferate; Bierocracy, in Long Island City, Queens, will join recent arrivals like Berg’n in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and Belgian Beer Cafe NoMad in Midtown.
