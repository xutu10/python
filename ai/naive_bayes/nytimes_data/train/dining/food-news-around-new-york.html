Stamps honor American chefs, MatchaBar opens in Williamsburg and the Good Batch bakery in Clinton Hill.

To Post: Mini-Portraits of American Chefs The Postal Service is commemorating chefs in a new series of “Forever” stamps. They feature portraits of Edna Lewis, Julia Child, James Beard, Felipe Rojas-Lombardi and Joyce Chen. There have been postage stamps with food since 2005 (peaches), but this is the first time stamps have recognized food personalities. “They’re all pioneers,” said Susan McGowan, the director of stamp services for the post office:  To Brew: Giving Tea the Coffee Treatment Max and Graham Fortgang’s specialty is matcha, the silky powdered Japanese green tea that is traditionally whisked ceremoniously to a froth. The brothers take a more coffeelike approach at their new bar, whipping the iced matcha in a milkshake machine or brewing it into versions of cappuccino and latte. “Matcha is the espresso of tea,” Max Fortgang said. They also serve coffee. Their imported matcha is a fine grade, stone-ground at a tea farm in Japan. The new bar is decorated with vintage wallpaper in a tea leaf design and has old beams and stone arches. There is counter service for drinks and a retail case of sandwiches, salads and pastries, most made with matcha-flavored ingredients. There’s matcha mayo on sandwiches and matcha vinaigrette with tuna. Matcha powder in three-ounce tins is $22 for classic, $29 for premium:  To Evaluate: Tasting Hams From Here and Away Who could resist something that was billed as the great artisanal ham tasting? I was among more than 30 chefs, food experts and writers, including Michael Anthony of Gramercy Tavern, Steven Jenkins of Fairway and Matt Rudofker of Momofuku Ssam Bar, who took part in a blind tasting of 11 air-cured hams at Heritage Foods USA in Bushwick, Brooklyn. The idea was to evaluate (but not to rank) the hams, seven of them domestic and four imported. We considered not just the aroma and flavor, but also the ham’s marbling, texture and the quality of the fat. The American hams tended to be saltier than their European counterparts, said Dave Arnold, a food and drink expert who led the tasting. For me, there was no mistaking the Spanish Ibérico ham or the San Daniele from Italy, and it was relatively easy to spot most of the American ones. The ham that I mistakenly picked as European was La Quercia acorn-fed Tamworth. To Learn: Brooklyn Becomes Small-Batch Central It’s pretty much the same: “Brooklyn Spirits” could not have been written before 2002. That was when changes were first made in New York State liquor laws to permit craft distilling, and Brooklyn became home to a boomlet of artisanal producers. Lavishly photographed, the book chronicles the experiences of a dozen start-up whiskey and liqueur makers in the borough, including Breukelen Distilling, Van Brunt Stillhouse, Cacao Prieto, Greenhook Ginsmiths and Uncouth Vermouth. Threaded throughout are stories about the bars that use the spirits and the cocktails they create, like the Crown Heights Negroni and the Gravesend Smash. It includes several recipes and an excellent index of the cocktails:  To Indulge: From the Flea to Brick and Mortar The story is familiar. An artisanal food producer, in a career swap, starts with a stand at Smorgasburg or some other market. Eventually, as traffic and finances build, a temporary weekend affair becomes a brick-and-mortar store. Thus you have Anna Gordon’s trajectory. At the Brooklyn Flea, she was known for stroopwafels, the Dutch cookies served with coffee and tea. She still sells ice cream sandwiches there, but she now has a bakery with some seats and tables, and a bright expanse of counter filled with cookies, muffins, scones, layer cakes and ice cream sandwiches. She will bake pies and tarts in the fall, and will carry the Dutch cookies at the bakery at holiday time:  To Visit: In Philadelphia, What the Ancestors Ate Here is a different kind of food journey: The Penn Museum in Philadelphia has organized a tour throughout its collections that encourages visitors to reflect on the images of food and drink in works of art and cultural artifacts from different times and civilizations. Consider, for example, an Egyptian tilapia fish rattle, or an early 20th-century ostrich egg water container from South Africa. “Culinary Expeditions” is on display through Dec. 30. There are several self-guided tours:
