The 2015 New York City Michelin Guide has upgraded Aquavit, Blanca and Ichimura to two stars, up from one star last year. The new rankings, released today, have New York rolling in stars, with 20 places newly anointed or promoted. More than half are in Brooklyn and Queens. Is this grade inflation? “Not at all,” said Michael Ellis, international director for the guides. “We call them as we see them.” There are more restaurants meriting stars, he said, a result of increased interest in gastronomy everywhere, and more good restaurants outside Manhattan as chefs are following the population into other boroughs. At the top, in the three-star category, there are six New York restaurants, down from seven last year: Per Se, Masa, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare, and Eleven Madison Park.  “Daniel Boulud has been a pillar of the gastronomic community for 30 years, but this year we found a lack of consistency,” Mr. Ellis said. “We have to make difficult decisions. We’d rather give stars than take them away. We look forward to him getting his third star back.” There are now nine two-star restaurants, a jump from five last year. Among the 17 new one-star places are Betony, Batard, M. Wells Steakhouse, Meadowsweet, Zabb Elee and ZZ’s Clam Bar. Mr. Ellis said most of the new one-star places reflect a movement by young chefs to give their own personality to what they do, citing Andy Ricker’s take on Thai food at Pok Pok Ny and the freshness of Shaun Hergatt’s style at Juni. He was also pleased that River Café — which closed after Sandy but has since reopened — and Picholine have returned to the one-star list. A few places lost their single stars, among them Annisa, for which Mr. Ellis also cited lack of consistency. And despite the proliferation of restaurant ratings on the Internet, Mr. Ellis said that Michelin’s reputation has grown. He said that everyone has an opinion and a forum these days, but people need some way to sort it all out. “Who do you listen to?” he asked, noting that organizations like Michelin, which uses anonymous inspectors who pay for their meals, and apply objective standards to their evaluations, earn respect. “The chefs appreciate what we are doing,” he said. The guide, with its familiar red cover, will go on sale Oct. 1 for $18.99. For the complete listing:
