Headliner VIC’S About 20 years ago, Vicki Freeman, left, wet her feet in New York’s restaurant scene with Vix Cafe in a rough-hewed, space in SoHo. The chef was Marc Meyer, who had worked at the Odeon. The two married and built a food empire with Five Points, Cookshop, Hundred Acres and, soon, Rosie’s. Now they’ve redone Five Points, turning it into this new restaurant with a name that pays homage to Vix. The chef, Hillary Sterling, right, who worked at A Voce, cooks Italian-Mediterranean, offering a menu that includes pizza. Her shopping list consists mostly of American ingredients, but she turns to imports when it comes to items like Parmigiano-Reggiano.
