Persimmons, Pomegranates and Radicchio for a Colorful Winter Salad
Persimmons and pomegranates lend flavor and color to this dish.

Part of the thrill of seasonal cooking is welcoming the newly arrived fruits and vegetables. The tomatoes, eggplant and zucchini of August are now mere memories as we make way for the squashes, parsnips, apples and pears. But there are splashier, regal seasonal offerings from more-temperate climates now, including two winter fruits that are easy to love: orange-fleshed persimmons and ruby-red pomegranates. Bright orange persimmons hang from branches all winter, even after the leaves have dropped. Originally from Asia, where they have been cherished for millenniums, they were introduced to the Mediterranean, California and Australia. There are many types, but the two most common are Fuyu and Hachiya. Squatty, tomato-shaped Fuyus are the ones to eat raw, either firm or partly ripened. Peeled and cut into wedges, they are a wonderful addition to winter salads. Or eat them with yogurt and honey, or, since they are somewhat melon like, with thin slices of prosciutto. (The pointy Hachiya type is too tannic and astringent to eat until it is very soft and ripe, so it is more commonly used in cakes and puddings.) Pomegranates, born in the Middle East, where they are still consumed in abundance, have also traveled the world. When properly ripened, they burst with sweet-tart crimson seeds (or arils). These succulent jewels can be spooned or scattered over any number of dishes, or squeezed for their brilliant red juice. (They have gained superfood status for their possible antioxidant effect.) For one of my favorite seasonal salads, I combine persimmons and pomegranates with various members of the chicory family. Treviso and radicchio leaves make a spectacularly colorful display, and their slight bitterness complements the fruits. You could also use Belgian endive, curly endive and escarole, or some of the speckled chicory varieties. To lend an earthy quality to the vinaigrette, I use fragrant walnut oil, sherry vinegar and shallots. For a crunchy garnish, there are caramelized walnuts with sea salt. Tossing the dark red leaves with meaty persimmon flesh and glistening ruby-like pomegranate seeds feels somehow extravagant, especially if there is snow outside.
