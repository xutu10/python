Mission Chinese Food Mr. Bowien said he had taken over the space occupied by Rosette, which closed on Saturday after the chef, Nick Curtin, left. Mr. Bowien said on Sunday night that he signed a lease two days ago. “We own the space,” he said. He said he planned a 74-seat restaurant and a private dining room, and expected to make only minor changes to the venue. He said he was to go before the community board on Monday for the liquor license. The new location would put Mission Chinese Food very close to Chinatown, though technically still on the Lower East Side. Mr. Bowien opened Mission Chinese Food on Orchard Street in May 2012,  Mr. Bowien paved the way for a new breed of Chinese restaurants — hipper and more freewheeling — several of which have been opening in New York in the last year or so. But vermin led to health department closings at Mission Chinese. These were followed by disputes with the landlord, and finally the restaurant was shut down. Mr. Bowien has since opened  “This is a very happy time for me,” Mr. Bowien said, who was cooking at Mission Cantina on Sunday night. “We are very excited. It has been a tough year.” As for Rosette, there are plans to reopen it elsewhere.
