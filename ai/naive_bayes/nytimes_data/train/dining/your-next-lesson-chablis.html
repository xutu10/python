Unraveling the Mystery of Chablis
Chablis, that most distinctive of chardonnays and a prime example of the idea that good wine speaks deeply of its place of origin.

Updated | Sept. 4, 2014 Wine School, a monthly column, invites you to drink wine with Eric Asimov. In each installment, Mr. Asimov chooses a type of wine for you to try at home. After a month, Mr. Asimov posts his reaction to the wine and addresses readers’ thoughts and questions. August’s assignment was Chablis For two good reasons, I probably own more Chablis than any other white, and I probably drink it more often than any other wine. One, it’s a relatively good value for Burgundy, and two, I love it. But I don’t like every bottle of Chablis I open. Sometimes a Chablis can seem too tense, thin and nervous, like an over-caffeinated Woody Allen in a bottle. Others could use some of that tension, but instead slouch like slackers, as though they were no more than mediocre chardonnays. Still, I seem so imprinted with the distinctive chalky, seashell flavors of good Chablis that the occasional unsatisfactory bottle doesn’t deter me. Welcome again to Wine School, in which each month we explore a particular wine and then reconvene to share impressions and insights. The goal is to drink attentively, in a natural setting with food, family and friends. By promoting an atmosphere of curiosity and pleasure, the hope is to achieve a greater sense of ease and confidence with wine and an increased understanding of our own tastes. Even those who think they know wine well can benefit by re-examining assumptions and sharpening observations. The subject now is Chablis, which I consider the world’s most distinctive chardonnay and a prime exhibit of the idea that good wine speaks deeply of its place of origin. A crucial theme of Wine School has been this notion of terroir, the mysterious French term that encapsulates the soil in which the grapes grow, its microclimate, the elevation of the vineyard, its inclination toward the sun and the human hand that grows the grapes and produces the wine. From Bordeaux and Beaujolais through Sancerre, German riesling and California zinfandel, each wine has made the case for the importance of distinctiveness. But none make that case as clearly as Chablis. While it’s possible to make Bordeaux-like red blends in California or sauvignon blancs reminiscent of Sancerre in New Zealand, nowhere else produces a chardonnay remotely like Chablis. Sure, chardonnays the world over may share certain characteristics. The best, in my opinion, emphasize tension, texture and minerality rather than the extravagant fruit and buttered popcorn flavors so often attributed to oaky versions popular in the 1990s. Yet Chablis alone offers a specific sort of mineral quality, often likened to seashells, or at least the chalky, stony salinity we associate with them. What accounts for this? The best Chablis vineyards grow on what was a prehistoric sea. Even today one can run a hand through the limestone and clay soils and pick out fossilized shells and marine skeletons. Skeptics may scoff at the perhaps too obvious association of finding seashells in the soil and seashell aromas in the wine, while scientists have yet to agree on the precise effect of soils on the aromas and flavors of any wine. Yet, the wine expresses itself clearly with little regard for either skepticism or science. This is the sort of mystery that remains at the heart of good wine. Why does it taste like this? Even if we can’t answer with certainty the questions posed by Chablis, we can’t deny the evidence of our senses. For many readers who did their Chablis homework over the course of the last month, briny oceanic flavors were a theme. “One has the impression of smelling a (ideally Jurassic age) tidal pool,” wrote Carl Steefel of Berkeley, Calif. Another reader, schap329 of Richmond, Va., found a dominant applelike component on first opening the bottle, but noted an evolution over dinner as the wine warmed in the glass, like traveling “from the orchard to the ocean.” Jim M. in Madison, Wis., tried three different wines, likening one to “a seashell reduction,” noting citrus and “lots of minerals” in a second and “sea salt” in the third. The influence of geology in the case of Chablis is so powerful that it may even overcome the characteristics of the chardonnay grape. Consider that Chablis, though it is classified as part of Burgundy, is in fact nearer to Sancerre than it is to the Côte de Beaune, where most other great white Burgundies come from. Parts of Sancerre and Chablis have more in common geologically than Chablis does with the Côte de Beaune, and, even though Sancerre is made with sauvignon blanc rather than chardonnay, good Sancerres can sometimes be mistaken for Chablis and vice versa. Chablis is one of the most famous names in white wine, so famous that after Prohibition, big American wine producers appropriated the name for their white wines, a practice that continues today with the cheapest jug wines. Despite its fame, as Clive Coates points out in “The Wines of Burgundy,” the ravages of phylloxera, two world wars and severe midcentury frosts reduced Chablis in the 1950s to a scant fraction of its 19th-century production. It has made a welcome comeback since then, and the overall quality of Chablis has probably never been higher. Yet, the issue of inconsistency dogs Chablis. Mostly, this occurs on the lower end. As with all of Burgundy, Chablis vineyards are rated hierarchically. At the bottom is petit Chablis. Then comes straight Chablis, premier cru and, at the top, grand cru. The historic core of Chablis encompasses the grand cru and premier cru areas. But a good deal of what is now called Chablis and petit Chablis is a result of an expansion of appellation boundaries since the 1950s. Nowadays, grapes made into petit Chablis and Chablis may be planted in areas that may have little in common geologically with historic Chablis. Some producers are indifferent in their viticulture and winemaking, producing mass-market chardonnay rather than distinctive Chablis. Vintage is crucial as well. Climate change, which has reduced the danger of killer frosts, sometimes results in seasons too warm to produce wines with characteristic Chablis austerity. As is so often the case, consumers must take great care in selecting wines from conscientious producers. Fortunately, the three recommended bottles, all from the good 2012 vintage, were exemplary. They included two straight Chablis, one from Gilbert Picq & Ses Fils; the other from Jean-Paul & Benoît Droin, which demonstrated the fresh, vibrant pleasures available from good versions; and a premier cru, the Louis Michel & Fils Montmain, which was a step up in richness and concentration. Your next assignment: Chianti Classico Previously in Wine School ... In August, readers were assigned to investigate  From California we return to France to explore a wine made with one of the world’s most popular grapes: chardonnay. But this wine is Chablis. Considering the difference between chardonnay, the wine, and Chablis, the wine, will be our topic over the next four weeks. As far as I’m concerned, the best example of the power of terroir is a good Chablis. Great chardonnay wines are made all over the world, but none, no matter how hard the producers try, tastes like Chablis. Why? Because Chablis’s terroir, that slippery notion that combines the influence of the soil, the microclimate, the elevation, the inclination of the land toward the sun and the cultural influence, is so distinctive. Chardonnay, the grape, is an especially good transmitter of terroir. A chardonnay wine, made from grapes grown on the extreme Sonoma Coast, will taste quite difference from a chardonnay made from grapes grown in the Russian River Valley. In Burgundy, the spiritual home of chardonnay, these differences can be tasted on an almost microscopic level. Experienced Meursault drinkers, for example, can easily tell the steely, mineral wines of Perrières from the softer, more flowery wines of Charmes, a neighboring vineyard just across a narrow road. So what makes Chablis so unusual? In Burgundy, you could mistake a Puligny-Montrachet for a Chassagne-Montrachet and vice versa. You might try a good Australian chardonnay and find it convincingly Meursault-like. But no matter how many producers in California or elsewhere say their chardonnay is Chablis-like, it never really is. One taste of a good Chablis and you know that’s true. As in the rest of Burgundy, Chablis vineyards are rated hierarchically. At the top are the grand crus, next the premier cru vineyards, followed by plain Chablis and, at the bottom, Petit Chablis. The three suggested wines above are from the 2012 vintage and include two plain Chablis and one premier cru. They are exemplary and accessible wines, but you may not find them. It’s not so important to have the same wines that I have, as long as you have distinctive examples. Here are the three bottles that I suggest you find: Gilbert Picq & Ses Fils Chablis 2012 Jean-Paul & Benoît Droin Chablis 2012 Louis Michel & Fils Chablis Premier Cru Montmain 2012 Luckily, many good Chablis wines should be available from producers including: Christian Moreau, Billaud-Simon, Domaine William Fèvre, Domaine Barat, Daniel Dampt, Patrick Piuze, Gérard Duplessis, Joseph Drouhin, Daniel-Étienne Defaix, Alice & Olivier de Moor, Savary, Servin and Vocoret. You’d be especially lucky to find 2012 petit Chablis or Chablis from the two best Chablis producers of all, Vincent Dauvissat and François Raveneau. I highly recommend the splurge. Chablis is a quintessential shellfish wine. It goes beautifully with oysters, shrimp, scallops and crab, as well as the more delicate fish dishes. Also, salads, cheeses and chicken. Serve cool but not icy.
