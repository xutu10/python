Ingredients for Weeknight Dinner Success
Salt, olive oil and lemon are the items to reach for day after day, meal after meal, to create pretty much anything I feel like eating.

I have 24 kinds of chiles and over 50 dried herbs and seasonings in my spice drawer. There are dozens of oils and vinegars stuffed into my pantry, fresh herbs in pots on the deck, and a prodigious collection of condiments that I suspect is multiplying like bunnies behind the refrigerator door. Yet the items I reach for day after day, meal after meal, number exactly three: salt, olive oil and lemon. They are my culinary security blanket, my kitchen workhorses, the ingredients I always have on hand that I can use to create pretty much anything I feel like eating, in dishes savory or sweet. Even when I add herbs, spices or condiments to the pan, these three are where I start. Here’s how to prepare a typical weeknight dinner on autopilot: Select the main ingredient — beef, chicken, lamb, fish, tofu, broccoli, beans or what have you. Season it with salt, slick it with olive oil, drizzle it with lemon. The cooking method doesn’t matter. You can roast it, sauté it, fry it, bake it or stew it; olive oil works as the cooking medium, while lemon and salt provide the snap. Or whisk the three of them into a dressing to pour on top of anything raw, steamed and boiled. A serving of fresh vegetables doused in good olive oil and seasoned with flaky sea salt and lemon is possibly one of the best things a hungry person can eat, but it’s so simple that it is often eclipsed by fancier, fussier dishes. Naturally, when you’re employing this minimalist strategy, the quality of the ingredients matters. Buy the good stuff, splurging on the olive oil as if it were wine. If you can, taste it before buying. I keep at least two kinds of olive oil on hand: a lesser (and less-expensive) oil for cooking and a better one for drizzling. Make sure your lemons are fresh, and refrigerate them. As nice as that bowl of lemons looks on your counter, they will keep a lot longer in the fridge without drying out and losing the aroma of their sunflower-yellow zest. Then grate said zest and use it alongside the juice whenever you want an extra lemony punch. And keep in mind that golden, caramelized lemon slices — either fried in olive oil or roasted — will heighten the simplest of weeknight meals. Try tossing them into the standard pasta with Parmesan and watch a whole new world of flavors and textures open up on your plate. Last but not least, the salt. I probably have half a dozen kinds, from Hawaii red salt to Danish smoked salt, not to mention the flavored salts I keep getting as gifts. These are fun to play with, but generally I use kosher for cooking, fine sea salt for seasoning and baking, and flaky sea salt for finishing. It may seem strange to sing the praises of such a commonplace combination. But with a little care, they’ll make any ingredient shine like a superstar. And the cook as well.
