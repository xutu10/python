Braising Meat Makes Tough Cuts Savory and Tender
Tougher cuts, like beef short ribs, become savory and tender when cooked low and slow.

Carnivores, the season for meaty braises has arrived. Deep-flavored stews, amped up with assorted aromatics, are just right for cooking throughout the cold-weather months. Generally speaking, it is the front end of most beasts that qualifies for cooking “low and slow.” With beef, that means chuck, brisket and short ribs, along with shank, shin and cheek. These tougher cuts are incredibly delicious if allowed to cook at a bare simmer with a sufficient amount of liquid. Meaty beef short ribs in particular, whether they are English ribs (cut lengthwise along ribs) or flanken style (cut across the ribs in shorter lengths), are an excellent choice for any number of braises or stews. (Short ribs can also be grilled in the Korean manner,  Like most other stews, short ribs may be cooked a day or two ahead, then refrigerated in their braising juices. The advantages are twofold. For one, the flavors shine more brightly upon gentle reheating, and they seem to show more complexity. The other is that degreasing is made simpler. Just lift off and discard the hardened fat that has risen to the top, and the broth will be virtually fat-free. They are versatile, too, easily adapting to every kind of spice mixture. Here, a fragrant Chinese-inspired marinade featuring star anise, cinnamon, five-spice powder and tangerine makes them anything but ordinary. I always add a handful of dried Chinese chile peppers to render the braise both sweet and hot, and some Sichuan peppercorns to provide a subtle earthy dimension. Daikon radish, simmered along with the beef, absorbs the perfumed juices, too. The sauce is dark and savory. Other possible approaches are endless, from mild-mannered Yankee pot roast to bistro-style French pot-au-feu, or make them Italianate with a bit of tomato, red wine and dried porcini. Once you master the technique, you can customize short ribs to suit any whim. The trick with a braise like this is determining when the meat is perfectly done, for even a long-simmered dish can become overcooked. You want it completely tender but not falling apart, so test it with a paring knife to be sure. Taste it, too, to be extra certain — that’s a cook’s prerogative.
