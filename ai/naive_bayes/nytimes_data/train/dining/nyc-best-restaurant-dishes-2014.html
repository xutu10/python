The Best Restaurant Dishes of 2014
From a hot roast beef sandwich at Bar Primi to sashimi with Japanese chimichurri at Cagen, Pete Wells names favorite dishes of 2014.

The hot roast beef sandwich at  Thinly sliced meat with hot pepper sauce and provolone on a sesame roll isn’t meant to be the centerpiece of a formal dinner. Eating it should be a spontaneous act: You’re on the Bowery, you see that there’s no line, and you strike like a  Chicken schnitzel at  The restaurant keeps this dish unlisted, making servers introduce it as an addition to the menu — every night. It must be some private joke. The schnitzel, though, a breaded breast of poussin with potato salad, two fruit sauces and a fried drumstick for good measure, is not a joke. Prime rib at  The enormous piece of meat with extras and a high price has become a favorite restaurant trick. Most feel like thinly disguised attempts at pickpocketing. The considerable prime rib with pommes souffles and a nothing-fancy green salad feels like an event. Mushroom mille-feuille at  Not a pastry but an elegant mushroom terrine, with buttery, tender stems of king trumpets folded and folded, layer after layer. The stems unwind into ribbons, and you swipe them in green coconut curry. French onion soup at  Everything you want in a French onion soup, and one thing you didn’t know you wanted: a marrow bone, speared with a spoon and plunked in the middle of the bowl. Sashimi with Japanese chimichurri at  The bright, fresh, spicy green sauce served with sliced raw fish — made from shiso, wild ginger, jalapeños and yuzu — is one of those rare fusion recipes that feels not just natural but also inevitable. Bucatini with smoked uni at  Even if you are experiencing uni fatigue, this bowl of pasta is worth a taste just so you can experience a carbonara made from sea urchin. Octopus with XO sauce and brown-butter espuma at  The XO sauce is a complicated jumble of sweet and savory, crunch and chew, pork and seafood. The espuma is the opposite: a smooth, rich wave of foamed butter. What they do when they meet is the secret of this dish. Pizza with potato carbonara at  Two Roman treats in one, an ultrathin-crust pie in the style of Rome, topped with crumbly potatoes treated as if they’re spaghetti carbonara, with egg, pecorino and crisp frills of guanciale.
