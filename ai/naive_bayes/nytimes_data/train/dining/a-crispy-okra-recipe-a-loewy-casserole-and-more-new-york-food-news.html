It comes with two dozen chicken wings and six hefty portions of baked ziti:  To Savor: Going the Scots Better With Smoked Salmon Daniel Boulud has come up with three types of smoked salmon infused with spirits. One, the Highland, is made with single malt whiskey and seasoned with cardamom. Baja conveys a whiff of tequila along with cilantro, and Riviera combines pastis with fennel, basil and pink peppercorns:  To Sip: Liqueurs Capture Spirit of Home and the Holidays For years, Marni Witkin, a home cook in Los Angeles, concocted liqueur from citrons, or etrogs, the citrus that is the symbol of the holiday of Sukkot. It became so popular that she began producing it commercially with her husband, Howard, under the name Sukkah Hill. The delicate Etrog liqueur has sweetness balanced by a slightly bitter finish.
