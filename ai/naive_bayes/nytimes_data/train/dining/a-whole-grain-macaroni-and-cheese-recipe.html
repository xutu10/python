A Whole Grain Macaroni and Cheese Recipe
Indulging in this dish won’t require a New Year’s resolution afterward.

During Christmas vacation, there are always extra mouths to feed at my house, and lots of dinner parties and potlucks for which I need to prepare. So I’m always thinking casseroles, those utterly practical and satisfying dishes that can be made ahead and reheated. This macaroni and cheese fits the bill perfectly, and it’s one that you can feel good about eating. It’s as comforting as any macaroni and cheese, but it’s not made in a saucepan with ingredients from a box, nor is it gloppy, as other versions of homemade mac and cheese can be. It’s got the richness and crusty gratinéed edges of any great baked casserole, with just enough cheese. I also threw some broccoli into the mix, which is welcome. I didn’t just add broccoli to make it healthy, either. I love the way the florets catch the béchamel — which is an olive oil-based béchamel — and to add texture to the dish. You can assemble this ahead and bake it when you need it, or bake it ahead and reheat. Just remember not to overcook the pasta; it should be more al dente than usual, so it won’t fall apart when you bake it in the final casserole.
