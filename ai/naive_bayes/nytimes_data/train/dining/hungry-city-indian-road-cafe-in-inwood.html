Hungry City: Indian Road Cafe in Inwood
At Indian Road Cafe in Inwood, there is scant evidence of the grating strain of foodie consciousness that has infiltrated American culture.

I moved to New York from the West Coast 20 years ago, but only this summer was I introduced to a little-known fact about the island of Manhattan: If you take the A train all the way to its northern terminus, you wind up in Seattle. Debark at 207th Street and amble in a northwesterly direction, and your steps will carry you to the sort of neighborhood hangout that calls to mind, to be more precise, the city of the Space Needle circa the early ’90s. There’s one counter for some very good coffee, and another with a considered selection of craft beers on tap. Leonard Cohen and Soundgarden tend to be ruminating and roaring from the sound system, and through the windows you can see the rim of  For anyone who doesn’t happen to live in this neighborhood, which is so far north that it brushes against the backside of the Bronx, wandering into  Of course, there is a chef at Indian Road Cafe, and his name (Nicholas Wright-Bodine) is printed on the season-driven menu, right above a box explaining which farms and purveyors have supplied the eggs and herbs and sausages. Beyond that, though, there is scant evidence of the grating strain of foodie consciousness that started to infiltrate American culture in the years that followed grunge. You can relax here; nobody’s going to lecture you. If you’ve had a rough day at work and just want a deftly composed  That skirt steak rides shotgun with a spatula heap of roasted potatoes; underneath, the chef lays down a schmear of aioli shot through with goat cheese. In the culinary tug of war between innovation and familiarity, Mr. Wright-Bodine pulls tenaciously for Team Comfort. At lunch one day, I devoured a sandwich that served as an object lesson on the virtues of salty-chewy, puffy-crusty simplicity: It involved grilled shrimp and rashers of bacon with chipotle mayo on a sesame ciabatta. Days later, I realized I was craving it, just as I was craving another Mini Cooper-size slab of the cafe’s German chocolate cake so that I could lick coconut-flecked frosting from a spoon while watching cartoons with my son. Sometimes Mr. Wright-Bodine aims for comfort but lands on cloying. I’m the first to concede that on the “I like sugar” versus “I like salt” spectrum, my palate falls somewhere in the vicinity of “I would drink a bucket of seawater,” but I’m still willing to bet that even a sweet freak would feel ambivalent about the chef’s weird treatment of burrata: When I had it, this creamy queen of the mozzarella realm arrived with both a garlic-scape pesto and an apple-cider reduction. In that and other dishes, the thread of sweetness was jarring; it was like tasting a dollop of strawberry jam in your clam chowder. On a couple of nights when I visited, the cafe offered a butternut squash “Wellington” (with a raspberry coulis, to boot) as an appetizer. I’d argue that it should have been listed among the desserts. I’d also argue that raspberry coulis represents the kind of ’90s nostalgia we can do without, but that won’t keep me from planning more sundown escapes to Indian Road Cafe, a restaurant that seems to exist so far from the assembly line of trends that you believe you’re a few thousand miles from New York. I mean that as a compliment. We could all use a road trip.
