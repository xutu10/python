A Recipe for Spicy Fish Cakes
Fish cakes break out with chiles and aromatic herbs. (Article plus video.)

The typical fish cake does not call attention to itself. Potato-rich, monochromatic and satisfying, it is the kind of thing you’d make for a homey dinner when the food wasn’t the point. Not so with these fish cakes, which, with their mix of aromatic chiles and herbs, are a brighter and more compelling take. The recipe starts out like any other by combining cooked white fillets with mashed potatoes, bread crumbs and eggs. After chilling, the mixture is coated in flour and fried until crisp and brown. But that’s all for the similarities. I’ve added flavor in every step. Instead of merely boiling the fish, I sear it with garlic, then steam it in vermouth or white wine. After the fish is done, the potatoes are simmered in the same pan as a way to deglaze it and incorporate the tasty browned bits stuck to its bottom. I leave the garlic cloves in the pan, too, to thoroughly soften along with the potatoes, then I mash the roots all together. Those garlicky mashed potatoes make a rich and pungent base for the fish. For seasoning, I stir in minced scallions, cilantro and basil, grated lime zest and hot green chiles. The cakes are speckled with green in the center, rather than dull all-white. And the flavor is vibrant and spicy — though the degree of spice depends on your chile. A small serrano will give you a mild but persistent heat. Substituting a jalapeño takes it down a notch, while using a Thai chile could make it fiery enough for your cheeks to flush. Tartar sauce is the classic fish cake accompaniment. But here you need something either stronger in flavor to stand up to these intense aromatics, or milder to mellow them. If you want the brawny option, I’d suggest mixing preserved lemons, or Indian lime or mango pickle, into good-quality mayonnaise. For something gentler, heap a big fat dollop of plain mayonnaise right on top of the cakes, and squeeze a little lime juice over it. Finally, a word about the fish. Cod is traditional, but its stocks are threatened, so consider a more sustainable fish. Any mild white-fleshed fish will work. Ask a knowledgeable fishmonger in your area, or consult the  Then whip up fish cakes that make a bright and exuberant statement — along with a satisfying meal.
