Danny Bowien Reopens Mission Chinese Food
If the Danny Bowien comeback is officially underway, no one seems more relieved about it than Mr. Bowien himself.
===
Danny Bowien can’t recall the name of the hotel in San Francisco. All he remembers is being holed up in a dark room, lying in bed, staring at the ceiling. For a chef with busy restaurants on both coasts, motionless moments are rare. But this was October 2013, and Mr. Bowien had just received word that Mission Chinese Food, the Lower East Side palace of psychedelic-Sichuan cuisine that had hurled him into the international spotlight, had been shut down by New York City’s health department for an array of sanitary violations, including the presence of mice. The news, he said, left him in a state of paralysis. He felt overwhelmed, embarrassed and worried for his staff. He knew he had to fly to New York to face the crisis, but he had committed to a Bay Area cooking event. He wasn’t sure where to turn. Then his phone rang. On the other end he heard a voice with a familiar Danish accent. It was  That may sound like a terrifying (albeit prophetic) form of consolation, but Mr. Bowien can smile about it now that a new version of  As the 32-year-old chef will be the first to tell, the curveballs of the last two years forced him to grow up fast. He parted ways with alcohol, which had become his stress-relieving sidekick. “I drank like crazy,” he said. “Not to have fun. I was destroying myself.” He became a father: His wife, Youngmi Mayer, gave birth to their son, Mino, about 10 months ago. And after a stretch of being so well liked and in demand that he seemed like the culinary world’s version of Jimmy Fallon, he quietly stepped out of the celebrity whirlwind and got back to where he feels he belongs: in the kitchen. “I got swept up in the whole thing,” he said. “Doing events everywhere, getting flown all over the world, not being in the restaurants enough. At the end of the day, my time is best spent in the restaurants. This is what got me here.” He said the jarring call from his mentor and friend in Denmark — as well as several doses of stern instruction from another older-brother figure, the chef  Focus is what Mr. Bowien would spend a year or so hustling to regain. After a stellar debut in New York — a James Beard Award for Rising Star Chef, near-universal plaudits from his fellow chefs and the news media, including  “One day he just looked at me and said, ‘I think I’ve been traumatized,’ ” his wife said. “It took a few months for him to say that to me.” For a while Mr. Bowien probably wished he had kept hiding in that hotel room. He was in the midst of opening a Lower East Side taqueria, Mission Cantina, but he now admits that dealing with the health department issues distracted him and scotched a crucial research trip to Mexico, which meant that he unveiled Cantina before it was ready. Looking back, he thinks he played it too safe with the food, choosing an attempt at authenticity instead of firing up the cross-cultural flavor detonations that had made him famous. “I wasn’t doing what we do best, and also I had lost all my confidence,” he said. After eating at Cantina, Mr. Redzepi sent Mr. Bowien an email bluntly stating that  “People were slamming Cantina,” Mr. Bowien said. “I took it personally. I didn’t know how to handle that.” Mission Chinese Food had reopened days after the health department shut it. But weeks later, the department closed it again, and it stayed closed. Mr. Bowien and his team determined that there were insurmountable problems with the building on Orchard Street. “I just chose not to reopen the restaurant,” he said. “We had passed all the inspections. Technically that restaurant could still be open.” He began to feel the best strategy was to pay attention to the message he was getting, and to move on. “We wanted a new start,” he said. “We just wanted to do something better.” His team later filed a lawsuit against the landlord, Abraham Noy, arguing that he had failed to bring the building up to proper standards; Mr. Noy followed with a countersuit denying that allegation and saying that the Mission Chinese team owed thousands of dollars in unpaid rent.  Regardless of who was right, allies believed that Mr. Bowien could not rise above the problem by taking a principled stand. “What I told him was, ‘There’s no excuse,’ ” Mr. Chang said. “If you have a problem and it’s not an act of God, no one cares in New York City. I don’t think people have time for sympathy.” Ed Levine, the founder of the Serious Eats food site, chalked up the health department headache as “a matter of a relatively inexperienced chef-restaurateur not understanding the vagaries of New York restaurant real estate.” He added: “I don’t think it’s going to mean anything moving forward. I don’t think people are going to say, ‘Oh, his food’s not safe.’ I think people see it for what it was.” If Mr. Bowien has grown up since then, so has Mission Chinese. “I just thought Danny needed to elevate his food,” Mr. Chang said, “and he will have that opportunity with this restaurant.” The original restaurant sported a beer keg on the floor, an endless line out the door and the cramped, booming, improvised feeling of a Flaming Lips album-release party (a gathering that Mr. Bowien’s band actually performed at in a previous life in Oklahoma). The décor seemed to throw takeout-counter kitsch and indie-rock cool together in a wok with a few extra fistfuls of Sichuan peppercorns. “You feel like you’re in a bad Chinese restaurant but you’re in a really good Chinese restaurant,” the chef  But the new space at 171 East Broadway, which housed the restaurant  Or your children. In keeping with that banquet-style atmosphere, the new menu is vast. Customers who snag one of its 130 seats will be able to order à la carte, but they’ll also have a chance to select a feast along the lines of an Asian-Rabelaisian smorgasbord ($69 for the smaller spread, and $99 for the full monty). The space even has a pizza oven. Mr. Bowien, his executive chef, Angela Dimayuga, and their crew are using it to make cheese-and-tomato sauce pizza, as well as fluffy naan-style bread that can be dredged in kefir butter and buttermilk and paired, if so desired, with a serving of caviar. (The dough has been developed by  There is a “beggar’s duck,” stuffed with sticky rice and ginseng, wrapped in a lotus leaf, baked in clay and cracked at the table with a mallet. There is a raw bar. There are spicy chicken wings and squid-ink peanut noodles with “numbing oil” and many variations on the theme of fried rice (lobster, salt cod, beef jerky), as well as prime rib sliced at the table from a Lawry’s-style roaming cart. “You wouldn’t see a lot of this in any Chinese restaurant,” Mr. Bowien said. “Why are we doing a pizza in a wood-fired oven here? Because it’s what we really like.” On a recent Thursday morning, he tended to sizzling sausage patties and frying eggs on a griddle at Mission Cantina. This is where you can usually find him these days: at a stove or a wok, cooking whatever strikes his fancy. And true to the mash-up spirit of Mr. Bowien’s cuisine, Mission Cantina has evolved into a Mexican restaurant that happens to serve a Vietnamese repast every morning. Mr. Bowien refers to the breakfast as “an additional revenue stream,” but it also represents a return to his roots as a seeker of new flavors in California. Back when Mr. Bowien and his business partner, Anthony Myint, were dreaming up the original Mission Chinese Food in San Francisco, a typical day’s nourishment would involve Vietnamese food in the morning and Mexican from noon onward. A therapist might point out that Mr. Bowien has recreated the diet that powered him through his early successes. A workday in New York finds him fixing banh-mi-style breakfast sandwiches in the morning, switching to tacos in the early afternoon, then dashing over to Mission Chinese to whip up lobster fried rice and thrice-cooked bacon. Though he’s never been doughy, Mr. Bowien looks so skinny these days, as he zips around in a baseball cap and Stan Smith tennis shoes, that he could be mistaken for a teenage skate punk. “I work from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. seven days a week,” he said. “And I’m a dad.” Becoming a father recalibrated his priorities, he said. (For one thing, he’s no longer vomiting every morning because of the anxiety.) “It does ground you, it does center you, it makes everything O.K.,” he said. “You have that — you have your kid. Say we get a bad review now? I don’t really care.” He does care, though, about getting those tortillas right. The first thing he eats every morning, as he sidles up to the griddle at Mission Cantina, is a tortilla that has been freshly pressed and smeared with guacamole. He likes to test them. “Does Cantina make the best tortillas in New York?” he asked. “I think so. Or we will.” He knows a lot more about tortillas now, just as he knows a lot more about the city’s sanitary regulations and the perils of spreading yourself too thin. “Going through all this adversity, going through all this difficulty is what defines you,” he said. “I’m just thankful to be cooking.”
