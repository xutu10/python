Cornas Reds Rated by the Wine Panel
Cornas in the northern Rhône Valley offers the rare combination of northern Rhône finesse combined with southern sun.

Of all the elements that go into producing great wine, one of the most crucial is also one of the most overlooked, except by those who provide it: sweat. To anybody who has ever wielded a trowel in a backyard vegetable patch, it comes as no surprise that farming is hard work. Forget for a moment the cellar work, with its endless hauling of barrels, repositioning of equipment and mastery of hoses. These are labor-intensive tasks to be sure, but for those who grow their own grapes, it’s the farming itself that requires holy dedication and earns the inventor of aspirin nightly blessings. This is especially true on the hillside vineyards of the world, crazily angled places like, to name a few, the Mosel and Rhine valleys in Germany, Ribeira Sacra in Spain, the Douro in Portugal and the northern Rhône Valley in France, where grapevines are planted on slopes so steep as to defy all common sense. One such place is the mountain that rises above the village of Cornas on the west bank of the Rhône, forming an amphitheater facing southeast toward Valence. For more than a thousand years, humans have grown grapevines in its granite soils, trudging up the precipitous hillside to perform their arduous chores. Hillsides like Cornas do not lend themselves to modernity. The slopes are too steep for tractors and other labor-saving devices, and the small landowners who mostly farm the syrah vineyards rarely can afford to hire teams of outsiders to do the work. The sweat is largely their own. For much of the 20th century, hard work in the vineyard earned few rewards beyond the satisfaction of extending a tradition and culture, and of producing the wine itself. For most people, that was not enough. The late 19th-century scourge of phylloxera, the root-eating aphid that destroyed most of the vines of Europe, followed by war, depression and war again, was enough to convince the mid-20th century generation that working in factories or offices was easier and more lucrative than laboring among the family vines. Even the faithful, who continued to farm the vineyards and preserve the local heritage, needed to work other jobs to earn an income. It must have come as a shock to these farmers when, in the second half of the 20th century, the rest of the world awoke to the treasures of the northern Rhône. While Hermitage had been well known and respected, Côte-Rôtie, the northernmost appellation of the northern Rhône, had been considered a backwater. Then, in the 1980s and ’90s, the world came to tiny Cornas, where the total vineyard area was about the size of a single midrange Bordeaux estate. The incipient attention, along with the potential of the terroir, was enough to draw people back to the region. Historic vineyards were renewed, and the faithful who never abandoned the vines, vignerons like Noël Verset, Auguste Clape and Robert Michel, came to be regarded as heroes rather than eccentrics. Today, the region remains tiny, with maybe 300 acres of vines. Not a lot of wine is produced, and the combination of labor-intensive work and high demand makes it expensive, around $50 a bottle and up. To assess the wines and how they express the terroir and culture of Cornas, the tasting panel sampled 20 bottles from recent vintages. Florence Fabricant and I were joined for the tasting by Michael Madrigale, the head sommelier at Bar Boulud and Boulud Sud, and Jeff Taylor, the wine director at Betony. I will confess, if you couldn’t already tell, that I love the wines of Cornas. The tasting affirmed for us that the region is a treasure, and the wines taste as if they could come from nowhere else. As the southernmost red-wine region of the northern Rhône (except for a finger of St.-Joseph that extends just to its south), Cornas offers the rare combination of northern Rhône finesse combined with southern sun. The result are soulful, expressive wines with a wild, almost feral component, as if you can taste blood, granite, iron ore and, yes, sweat in the wines. I mean this in the best possible way. Yet these are not rustic wines. It’s been repeated a little too often that Cornas is the country bumpkin to the more sophisticated wines of Hermitage and Côte-Rôtie. Perhaps this was true once, but today the level of quality is high. What sets Cornas apart is not a lack of sophistication but a transparent expression of place. Because we buy wines retail, with a cap of $100 a bottle, we were not able to include anything from Thierry Allemand, one of Cornas’s superstars, whose wines are profound but beyond our budget. We did find wines from all the other top producers, from vintages ranging from 2009 to 2012. All of these wines will benefit from at least five or more years of aging, and vintages like 2010, which will be very long-lived, could use even more. Our favorite was the 2011 Chaillot from Franck Balthazar, a complex, gorgeously aromatic wine that seemed to capture the savage beauty of the region in a glass. Right behind were a series of other wines, including the graceful, expressive 2011 Vieilles Vignes from Alain Voge; the savory, dense, yet accessible 2011 from Domaine de la Grande Colline; the almost primal 2009 Terrasses du Serre from Domaine du Coulet; and the smoky, stony, tannic 2011 from Auguste Clape, a longtime Cornas benchmark. Also near the top were two wines from the excellent 2010 vintage: the complex, full-bodied Guillaume Gilles, which will need at least another few years to open up, and the meaty, dense La Saborotte from Domaine Courbis. As Cornas has gained renown, this highly insular village has become maybe slightly more worldly. Taking its place alongside the traditional Cornas names of Balthazar and Clape in our Top 10 is Domaine de la Grande Colline, whose proprietor,  Mr. Ooka, who apprenticed with Mr. Allemand, makes his wines as naturally as possible, without additives. His 2011 Cornas was his first vintage, from vines planted in 2008, and this delicious wine signals a bright future. Hard work pays off, especially when added to the sweat of generations before.
