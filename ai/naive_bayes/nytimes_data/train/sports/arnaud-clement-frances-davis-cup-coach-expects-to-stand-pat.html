Despite their poor results at the Paris Masters, France captain Arnaud Clément said on Saturday that he would stick with his regular players for the Davis Cup final against Switzerland. Clément has picked four players — Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Richard Gasquet, Gaël Monfils and Gilles Simon — for a training camp in Bordeaux to prepare for the final Nov. 21 to 23 in Lille. He can still make changes before the final, but Clément said he was unlikely to call up new players at the last minute. No French player advanced past the third round in Paris, but Clément was adamant that he was not worried about hosting a formidable Swiss team led by Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka. France picked indoor clay to host Switzerland in a bid to thwart Federer’s quest for a first win in the team competition. With the best-of-five series scheduled five days after the ATP finals, the French team is betting that Wawrinka and Federer — who qualified for the year-end event — will struggle to adapt to clay, a surface on which both Tsonga and Gasquet have beaten Federer, a 17-time Grand Slam champion.
