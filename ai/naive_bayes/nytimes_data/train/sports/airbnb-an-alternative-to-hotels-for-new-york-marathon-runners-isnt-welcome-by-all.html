Airbnb, an Alternative to Hotels for New York Marathon Runners, Isn’t Welcome by All
Even as it is aligning itself with the marathon, one of the city’s most storied athletic events, Airbnb is at loggerheads with the New York attorney general’s office and local hotels.

Adrien Marlault, a Parisian businessman and avid runner, has stayed at hotels in the past when running marathons in Berlin, Rotterdam and Rome. But for this year’s  Marlault, who is running the race with his twin brother, found an Airbnb listing in Midtown Manhattan that will accommodate both of them for 1,000 euros, or $1,273, much less than a hotel in the area would cost for a week. “It will be nice to share the experience with someone in the city,” Marlault said in a phone interview this week. “And it’s cheaper and nicer than a hotel. For foreigners, it can be difficult to get into the marathon. So it’s a bit of an adventure.” After exchanging messages with his host, he learned that she, too, was French, a pleasant surprise. “Now, I just need to run the race in under three hours,” he said. Marlault is one of thousands of people taking advantage of Airbnb’s push into the booming industry of running tourism. But Airbnb’s status as an official partner of the New York City Marathon is turning out to be something of a pebble in the sneaker for many involved with the five-borough race. Even as it is aligning itself with one of the city’s most storied athletic events, the company is at loggerheads with the New York attorney general’s office and local hotels. A report issued last week by Eric T. Schneiderman, New York Road Runners, the nonprofit group that organizes the marathon, maintains relationships with local law enforcement and the mayor’s office in the promotion and staging of the race, which this year will be run Nov. 2. Despite the awkwardness of the attorney general’s report, the group has vigorously defended the partnership with Airbnb. “This is not meant to be a replacement to hotels,” Chris Weiller, a spokesman for Road Runners, said. “It’s an alternative for runners. We see this as bringing the global running community together and we’re always looking for ways to get runners engaged. Airbnb is one of the leading communities, and the connectivity opportunity is amazing.” Weiller added: “We’re aware that Airbnb is working through issues with cities and states. And people should consult their building rules. But we’re not involved with those issues and we can’t comment on that.” While organizers declined to say how much Airbnb paid for its sponsorship, which includes placing banner ads throughout the city tied to the race, Weiller said it was part of a broader effort by Road Runners to benefit runners and New Yorkers. It reflects the larger appeal Airbnb has had in the choices runners are making as they travel the world to compete in races, as well as a shift in the way people come and go for New York’s biggest events. In the early days of the marathon, which was first staged in 1970, couch surfing was common among a scrappy set of runners, but it was not yet a business or politically controversial. Since then, entries to the New York City Marathon have ballooned, and the race is now the largest marathon in the world, with more than 50,000 runners registered, as top finishers and plodders alike have pinned on bibs and taken finish-line selfies. Airbnb said that last year, New Yorkers earned about $1 million over marathon weekend while hosting more than 10,000 visitors. About three-quarters of those guests were from foreign countries. The company will have cheer zones located throughout the course and provide runners with Airbnb stickers in their goody bags. Although the marathon has long lacked a mascot, Airbnb has created one of its own through its social media campaign, adding stick legs, arms, a headband and running shoes to its own logo — hardly the look of a service that has attracted the ire of the state attorney general. In a statement, an Airbnb spokesman, Nick Papas, said that the report’s conclusions “rely on incomplete and outdated information,” and added, “we should not deny thousands of New Yorkers the chance to share their homes, pay their bills and stay in the city they love.” The marathon uses Hilton and Sheraton as headquarter hotels, but only in providing accommodations for elite runners and V.I.P.’s tied to the race. Weiller said the decision to move some events that were previously staged at the Mandarin Oriental to the reopened Tavern on the Green had “nothing to do” with the Airbnb partnership and predated the signing of the deal. Members of the hotel industry have been vocal critics of Airbnb. The Hotel Association of New York City declined to make its representatives available for comment. The New York State Hospitality and Tourism Association did not respond to requests for comment. Greg Hruby, who ran the race in 2009 and has in the past listed his apartment on the Upper West Side on Airbnb, said that while he had a good experience with the site in the past, the attorney general’s report upset him because of how Airbnb was representing itself. “The reality is there are some bad actors out there in the market,” Hruby said. “Yet Airbnb says they’re out there fighting for the middle class.” For Ricardo Scarlatella, Airbnb provided a counterpoint to the disappointment he felt when an injury caused him to pull out of this year’s race. Scarlatella, who works as a broker in the architectural building materials industry, decided he would participate in a different way: by listing rooms in his four-bedroom Lawrenceville, N.J., home on Airbnb at $120 per night. “It’s a great way for people to take advantage and stay somewhere for a fair price,” he said. “And I have a home that I want occupied.”
