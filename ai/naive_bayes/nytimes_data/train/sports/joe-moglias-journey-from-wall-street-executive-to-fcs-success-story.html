Joe Moglia's Journey From Wall Street Executive to F.C.S. Success Story
Joe Moglia has had a twisting life story, going from football coach to corporate executive and back, and he is now leading Coastal Carolina’s successful football program.
===
CONWAY, S.C. —  Joe Moglia’s life story sounds as if it was concocted in Hollywood, but as improbable as it may seem, it is not fiction. There is no fudging on his résumé, no invented jobs — only an unlikely narrative that would make a good movie. His story goes like this: A journeyman assistant football coach, toiling at the college level, Moglia eventually abandons his passion to pursue a career on Wall Street. He quickly rises to a top job at a giant firm, then quits to run an upstart brokerage in Omaha. After earning billions for investors and many millions for himself, Moglia steps down at 59 to resume his quest to be a head football coach. Rejected at nearly every turn, he lands at an up-and-coming college program in a small Southern outpost and promptly leads it to a No. 1 ranking and a shot at a national title in the second tier of Division I football. And there was another twist in the past week, when Moglia suddenly found himself being touted as a dark horse to fill one of the most coveted jobs in the business — head coach at Nebraska, where the incumbent was fired last weekend. But that talk was squelched on Thursday, when Nebraska picked Oregon State’s Mike Riley to fill the position. Still, it was remarkable in itself that Moglia was part of the conversation. “I’ve been incredibly fortunate to have two careers that I’ve been pretty good at and both of which I really love,” Moglia said recently as he sat in his office. “It’s a great story.” Indeed, as he prepares to lead the Chanticleers of Coastal Carolina University into a Football Championship Subdivision playoff game Saturday against Richmond, he has become a 65-year-old marvel. Over the past week, as he delivered speeches to his players, interviewed recruits and met with his staff, he was chased by reporters wanting his thoughts on the Nebraska job, which would have been the perfect topping on his layer cake of careers. Not that he isn’t reasonably satisfied now. “I don’t have to take a bigger job because of the money,” said Moglia, who makes roughly $185,000 a year as the coach of Coastal Carolina. “My ego doesn’t tell me I’ve got to play in a bigger stadium.” In a twist — and there have been many for Moglia — it was the just-dismissed Nebraska coach, Bo Pelini, who was instrumental in helping Moglia manage the leap from finance back to football. In 2008, Moglia was near the end of his seventh year as the chief executive of TD Ameritrade, a brokerage firm based in Omaha. He had taken on the job after being lured away from Merrill Lynch by Ameritrade’s founder, Joe Ricketts, whose family now owns the Chicago Cubs and Wrigley Field. It had been a wise move for Moglia, but now he wanted to step down as chief executive to pursue his football dream, although he agreed, in departing, to become the chairman of Ameritrade, a part-time job with big-time responsibility. (It is also a title he still holds, which makes him the only college football coach who currently oversees the management of a multibillion-dollar enterprise.) But how did he find a college willing to hire him as its coach after all those years in the financial world? And for that matter, how did he land on Wall Street after working as a football assistant for more than a decade after leaving college? Simple. In both cases, he was willing to start at the bottom. “Here’s a guy with a career under his belt, he’s a little older than the other guys, he has several kids, but he’s not such a bad bet,” Moglia recounted as he thought back to how his 1983 application to join a Merrill Lynch training program might have struck the company. Merrill Lynch apparently took the same view Moglia did, and soon he was training alongside several dozen graduates with M.B.A.s. From there, Moglia, who once worked at his father’s fruit stand in Manhattan, ended up with a job at Merrill Lynch selling bonds, then quickly rose through several layers of management. He used the same approach when he decided, all those years later, to return to football. He reached out to Tom Osborne, the former Nebraska coach, who suggested that Moglia shadow Pelini, then in his second year with the Cornhuskers, to get reacquainted with the sideline. Pelini agreed to the idea. So for the next two years, Moglia served as an unpaid executive assistant, studying Nebraska game plans, watching film and counseling players about what Moglia called “life after football.” All the while, he sought a college that would take a chance on a retired chief executive who had cashed his last paycheck as a football coach in the early 1980s. A few places nibbled, but none bit, so Moglia took the only offer that came his way — from the Omaha Nighthawks of the short-lived United Football League. The Nighthawks won just one of their five games in the 2011 season. But for Moglia, it was vital experience. Two months later, in a move that stirred up a tempest in the world of South Carolina football, David DeCenzo, Coastal Carolina’s president,  “It’s either going to be the most phenomenal decision I’ve ever made, or I’m going to look back and say, ‘Oh-oh,’ ” DeCenzo said at the time. Bennett had been a popular figure, a man with local roots who had recently been coach of the year in the Big South Conference. He had even drawn national attention when his performance at a news conference in 2011 went viral on YouTube. Sharing a story that he had told his players about a stray cat, Bennett concluded: “Be a dog. We don’t need no meows, we don’t need no cats.  When Bennett was pushed aside, his supporters immediately speculated that Moglia had used his wealth to buy the job. Moglia and DeCenzo denied that, but the rumors flared anew this fall when TD Bank, which owns about 40 percent of Ameritrade, agreed to pay $5 million for the naming rights of the athletic complex at Coastal Carolina. “Would this have occurred without Joe? I doubt it,” said Wilbur Prezzano, a director on the boards of TD Bank and Ameritrade who lives in Charleston, S.C. Prezzano, a former executive at Kodak, said he had been impressed by how successfully Moglia made the transition from the financial industry back to coaching. Occasionally, though, Moglia still travels in the other direction. On Nov. 20, for instance, two days before the final game of Coastal Carolina’s regular season, Moglia left his team and flew to New York to have dinner with the directors of Ameritrade and pay tribute to J. Peter Ricketts, a son of the founder, who was about to become governor of Nebraska. The next day, Moglia served as chairman of Ameritrade’s board meeting in Manhattan, which lasted more than five hours. As soon as it was over, he was on a private jet back to South Carolina. And the next day, Brooks Stadium was buzzing as fans wearing teal filed in to see the undefeated Chanticleers host Liberty, a conference rival. Coastal took a 7-3 lead early in the second quarter and led, 14-12, late in the fourth as Liberty drove toward a go-ahead score. On the Coastal Carolina sideline, the coaches discussed whether to allow Liberty to score a touchdown quickly so there would be enough time to respond. But Moglia decided against it. His defense held Liberty to a field goal, leaving Coastal Carolina 1 minute 20 seconds to get into range for a winner. And it did, moving to Liberty’s 6-yard line with three seconds left. But Alex Catron, a senior who had missed his only previous attempt in the game, kicked a low wobbler that was blocked. Asked afterward if he considered sending out a different kicker at the end, Moglia said he had never lost faith in Catron. Instead, Moglia blamed himself for the loss. “That’s on me,” he said repeatedly. He has tried to instill a certain philosophy in his players, which he summed up in three words: “Be a man.” It strikes a chord with parents like Bruce Mapp Sr., the father of the team’s leading receiver. “I don’t think it’s corny at all,” Mapp said from his home in Philadelphia. “You never forget the life lessons you’re taught when you’re young.” He said he had seen “steady maturation” in his son under Moglia’s mentorship and said he was especially proud of how his son acted after the tough loss to Liberty. “My son went down there and shook everybody’s hand,” Mapp said, even though the Liberty players were whooping it up on the field. Coastal Carolina finished the season 11-1 and fell to a No. 7 seeding in the playoffs. If the team gets past Richmond, the Chanticleers will probably have to travel to Fargo to face North Dakota State, which has won three straight championships. Winning it all may be a long shot, but it would be just one more plot twist in the continuing Joe Moglia story. Somewhere down the road, he has said, he wants to work on his Italian and his piano playing. For the moment, there are more games to coach. And who knows what else awaits?
