Serbia and Albania were punished for on-field violence sparked by a banner being flown by a drone over the stadium during their European Championship qualifier in Belgrade last week.  UEFA ruled that Albania forfeited the match because its players refused to return to the pitch amid the disorder. Serbia was docked the three points gained by the win, because of crowd disturbances and fireworks and missiles that were set off during the game. Serbia was also ordered to play its next two Euro 2016 qualifiers without fans. ■ The former England captain Rio Ferdinand, 35, who plays for Queens Park Rangers, said he planned to retire at the end of the season. ■ The American striker Abby Wambach is one of 10 players on the shortlist for FIFA’s Ballon d’Or award for the best female player in the world.
