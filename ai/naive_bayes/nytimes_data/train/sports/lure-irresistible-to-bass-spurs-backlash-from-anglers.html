Lure Irresistible to Bass Spurs Backlash From Anglers
Andy Poss’s Alabama Rig was banned by organizers of the country’s two major bass fishing competitions because some professional anglers felt it could be too effective.

The device is composed of five wires angled like spokes of an umbrella, with fishing lures attached to each end. It mimics a school of baitfish, and bass, walleye and northern pike apparently cannot stay away from it. Its inventor, Andy Poss, dreamed up the device, which he called the Alabama Rig, while watching a tuna chasing a school of sardines on “The Blue Planet,” a BBC documentary series. In July 2011, he built his first prototype by hand in his garage in Muscle Shoals, Ala., and he spent nearly 17 months perfecting it. In essence, he has built a better mousetrap, and he is rightly proud of it. But that is the problem: The Alabama Rig is too good. It was banned by the organizers of the United States’ two major bass fishing competitions, BASS (in 2012) and F.L.W. Outdoors (this year). In October, BASS extended the ban to all of its events, including its amateur series, college tournaments and regional club-level events. So the Alabama Rig, the first artificial lure to be banned from competitive angling, and other umbrella lures have joined the same outlaw company as spitballs in baseball, square-grooved clubs in golf and the Speedo LZR Racer suit in swimming. No one is discouraging everyday anglers from using the Alabama Rig, but the professionals on the sport’s elite circuits decided that it was a threat to fair play and pushed to keep it out of competition. “It’s a legitimate and ethical way to catch fish, but we hold professional anglers to a higher standard,” said David Precht, a spokesman for BASS. “Their argument — and I want to emphasize it’s not our argument — the anglers feel that sometimes it can be too effective and it takes away some of the skill in what is a traditional tournament.” For Poss, 52, the backlash against his lure has been disillusioning as well as costly. He has been fishing his whole life, and his father, Houston, was a well-known lure designer and builder. Since high school, all that Poss has ever wanted to be was a professional fisherman, and for 17 years now, he has fished the tournament circuit. “I really looked up to those guys,” he said. “But then you get in the business side of fishing; it was a really big letdown.” Poss leaned on his fishing experiences as a boy as well as his time as a mussel diver in the Tennessee River, where he studied how fish related to cover and bait fish. In 2010, he filed for a patent on his lure, and he trademarked the name Alabama Rig the next year. The umbrella rig has traditionally been used by saltwater anglers to troll for striped bass, but trolling — a method of fishing that involves dropping a line off a boat, driving around and hoping to come across fish — is not allowed in tournaments. Poss’s model made it possible for bass anglers to cast such a rig. Poss passed some samples to the professional angler Paul Elias to use in an F.L.W. tournament in October 2011 on Lake Guntersville in Alabama. Elias attached the Alabama Rig to a rod, stuck it in his rod locker and forgot about it. He fished from 6 a.m. to noon without a bite. As he passed under a bridge, he noticed a current near some bridge pilings where he thought the Alabama Rig might work well. In four consecutive casts, he caught 15 pounds of fish. He went back to the spots where he had come up empty and caught 20 more fish. “It was turning on the fish like night and day,” Elias said. “I called Andy that night. I said: ‘I’ve got to ask you one question. Are you sure this thing is legal?’ ” Elias won the tournament with the lure, and word spread fast. In his home and his garage, Poss was producing and selling 200 rigs a day for $25 each with the help of friends and relatives. Soon, however, his business was threatened by companies selling copycat lures. “We’ve had patent pending on our product since it came out,” Poss said. “Nobody in the lure industry even gives that a nod, especially the bigger companies.” While waiting for his patent to be awarded, Poss has incurred legal fees and competed with knockoff lures made overseas. He had signed with Mann’s Bait Company as the exclusive licensee for the manufacturing and marketing of the Alabama Rig, but that contract recently expired. “The tournament thing was really the nail in the coffin,” said Scott Wall, a regional sales manager at Mann’s. “When the leagues banned it, that’s what killed the demand. Bass anglers are influenced by what they see the tournament guys fish with because that is what is promoted in the pages of magazines and on TV shows. If you don’t promote it, they are not going to fish with it.” Now, Poss has teamed with Swampers Lure Company to make a new and improved Alabama Rig that will compete with the lower-priced models. David Lefebre, a tournament angler in Pennsylvania, estimated that 70 percent of professionals were against umbrella rigs. He pushed hard for the ban on umbrella lures and refused to use them in tournaments before they were banned. “I would argue to my death, when they are biting that thing, there is nothing you can do to compete with it,” Lefebre said. “I’m a fan before I’m a competitor; anglers have been my heroes. My reasoning is to protect the sport as I know it.” But not everyone in the sport agrees. Casey Martin, an accomplished angler on the F.L.W. Tour, said catching bass was a matter of skill and experience regardless of the lure. And results on the tour showed that the Alabama Rig was not a magic bullet. “Now we’re starting to realize this is a great lure at the right time and conditions, but it is not a catch-them-everywhere-you-go type of lure,” Martin said. The umbrella rig also fell into gray areas of fishing regulations in states that limit the number of hooks an angler can have in the water at one time. In some cases, for instance, the number was three, so some state wildlife agencies amended or clarified their rules. Elias, the angler who won with the Alabama Rig, said his colleagues and tournament organizers could have been more patient and done further study before banning the rig. “To me it’s like the belly putter in professional golf,” Elias said. “They looked at it and studied it for several years, and now they made a ruling on it where you can use a longer putter but you can’t have it touch your body. That’s the kind of modifications that should have been done on the rig. It should have been looked at, thought through and then governed, but it just wasn’t done that way.”
