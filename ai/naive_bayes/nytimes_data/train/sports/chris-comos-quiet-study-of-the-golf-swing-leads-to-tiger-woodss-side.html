Chris Como’s Quiet Study of the Golf Swing Leads to Tiger Woods’s Side
Chris Como, a swing instructor, does not play golf; rather, he thinks about it and has tried to learn from the best.

WINDERMERE, Fla. —  Chris Como, the mechanic tinkering with  “He’s not a player turned teacher,” Zambri said. “He’s a thinker turned teacher.” Como, 37, is different from any of the other swing instructors Woods has employed. He is not from golfing royalty like Butch Harmon, the son of a Masters champion who turned pro and won once on the PGA Tour. Como is not like Hank Haney, an all-conference college golfer. He is not like Sean Foley, who also played varsity golf in college. Como is a seeker on a utopian quest for clues to unlock the mysteries of the golf swing. That search has consumed his 20s and 30s and led him all over the country to learn from the top instructors, including Foley. He has taught lessons by day and taken classes for his master’s degree in biomechanics by night, in an ascetic existence driven by curiosity. “He did what a lot of people aren’t necessarily willing to do,” Zambri said. “Move around the country, not make a lot of money, and study under guys considered to be elite instructors so he could expand his knowledge.” In Woods, a 14-time major winner, Como has the Hope Diamond of golfers to work with. Woods, 38, is not the first major champion to seek out Como, who grew up in Southern California and studied at Cal State Northridge. For the past six months, Como has instructed the 2008 Masters champion, Trevor Immelman, who described Como as “a very rare individual.” Immelman added: “The thing that intrigued me about him is he doesn’t teach a method or have a strategy. He has just studied and watched great players through the history of the game, some with so-called orthodox swings, some with so-called unorthodox swings. He understands how pieces of the puzzle work together.” Como has a slight build and a shy demeanor. He speaks so softly that when he gives Woods advice on the range, Joe LaCava, Woods’s caddie, cannot hear what Como is saying from an arm’s length away. It is easier to imagine Woods, without a major title since 2008, winning five more to pass Jack Nicklaus than to picture Como moonlighting as a television personality like Harmon or hosting his own reality TV instructional show, as Haney did. At Isleworth Golf and Country Club, site of the Hero World Challenge, the more fans gathered to watch Woods hit during his warm-up sessions, the lower Como pulled his baseball cap, as if trying to hide under its bill. When he speaks to Woods on the range, Como will invade his personal space and make eye contact, but will also frequently look down at the foam coffee cup in his hand or at his feet. Como calls to mind a passage from Jeffrey Kluger’s book “The Narcissist Next Door.” Real pride and real self-esteem, he wrote, “are much more an inward than an outward experience.” “They require no eye contact with others,” Kluger wrote, “indeed truly feeling the feelings may even require looking away — a signal of humility tempering the pride.” Asked Wednesday to answer a few questions, Como demurred. Neither Zambri nor Immelman was surprised to hear that Como did not want to talk about himself. They emphasized his humility and intelligence. “He’s the farthest thing from a show-off or a blowhard,” Zambri said. Immelman said: “He’s very humble, but I wouldn’t let that lull anybody into believing that he’s not competitive. He wants to help players play to their full potential, and by that I mean he won’t quit working until he feels like he’s exhausted all options trying to help you.” Woods said he had seen Como’s competitive side right away. Introduced to Como in August at a charity tournament hosted by Notah Begay III, his former Stanford teammate and a good friend, Woods hired Como as a consultant last month. If stumped during a session, Woods said, Como “will continue to try to think about it throughout the night and try to find a solution and answer.” Como’s turtlelike shyness may seem an ill fit for Woods’s fishbowl existence, but if Haney is to be believed, Como’s makeup is a perfect match for Woods. In his book “The Big Miss,” Haney wrote, “For all the super jocks Tiger was said to be friends with, smart, diligent straight-arrows are the guys he most relates to.” Como is the rare hybrid instructor who speaks like a character out of the 1970s Michael Murphy novel “Golf in the Kingdom” and carries a  Woods said: “I had this plan in my head of where I wanted to go and what I want my swing to look like and what I want to get out of my body and out of my game. I just needed to align myself with a person that felt the same way. Chris fits that for sure.” They have watched VHS tapes of Woods from his teenage years and his early years as a professional. His swing then was more upright, more fluid. Whether it is that his back finally is healthy, or that he has Como at his side, or a combination of both, Woods’s swing in the past week has been like the new old Tiger. On the Golf Channel, Begay said of Como, “I felt like he was the right person at this particular point in Tiger’s career to be able to not provide solutions, but to have relevant discussions.” Begay has been friends with Como since 2008. By 2013, Como had earned enough of a national following that Foley, during an interview with Charlie Rose, identified him as a rising star in the instructional world. On the day Woods posted online about his collaboration with Como, Foley, with whom Woods parted ways shortly after missing the cut at the P.G.A. Championship in August, received a call from a Golf Channel reporter seeking comment. Foley said Friday that his reaction had been “Yeah, that makes sense.” Speaking of Como, he added: “I know what it’s like to be in his shoes and be standing there like, ‘I can’t believe this is happening.’ I was asked on TV for my advice, and I said: ‘Enjoy the ride, man. It’s fantastic.’ ”
