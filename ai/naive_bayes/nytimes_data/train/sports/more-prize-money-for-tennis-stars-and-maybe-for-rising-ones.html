More Prize Money for Tennis Stars, and Maybe for Rising Ones
Last week, the ATP announced a 14 percent annual increase in prize money over the next four years at its Masters 1000 tournaments. On Wednesday, the International Tennis Federation proposed increases for its Pro Circuit, the lowest level of professional tennis.

As the popularity of professional tennis increases the prize-money pots, the leaders of the sport are trying to balance rewards for the top players with the needs of the lower ranks. Last week, the ATP announced a 14 percent annual increase in prize money over the next four years at its nine Masters 1000 tournaments, the highest-level events other than the Grand Slam tournaments. On Wednesday, the International Tennis Federation proposed prize-money increases for its I.T.F. Pro Circuit, the lowest level of sanctioned professional tennis. The I.T.F. surveyed more than 7,000 players and other stakeholders in the sport and analyzed data from the past 14 years, which revealed differences in expenses incurred by players based on ranking, geography and gender, as well as a falling success rate for players transitioning from the junior level to the professional ranks. According to the federation’s study, the number of ranked players competing in junior tennis has increased, while the percentage of those who achieve a professional ranking has decreased significantly. The I.T.F. found that the top 1 percent of male players (the top 50) earned 60 percent of all prize money, while the top 1 percent of female players (only the top 26 because of the smaller total number) earned 51 percent. In response, the I.T.F. has proposed increasing prize money at all levels of the pro circuit, which currently has men’s tournaments with total purses of $10,000 and $15,000 and women’s tournaments with purses between $10,000 and $100,000. (Men’s tournaments with prize pools above $15,000 are run by the ATP Challenger Tour, while the WTA delegates its Challenger-level events to the I.T.F.) If the proposal is approved by the federation board in March, the increases will take effect in 2016. The $10,000 tournaments would increase to $15,000; the $15,000 tournaments to $25,000; the $50,000 tournaments to $60,000; the $75,000 tournaments to $90,000; and the $100,000 tournaments to $125,000. Kris Dent, executive director of professional tennis for the I.T.F., said that strengthening the foundation of the sport at the lowest levels was crucial to its future. “Everyone else has had to come through this journey,” he said. “It’s a hugely vital part, a bit like an iceberg; this is the part that nobody sees, but it’s hugely important. We take that responsibility extremely seriously, so we’re delighted that we’re able to put money in, but we also believe that we’ve looked at some of the structural challenges to ensure that we continue to support the parts of the tennis world that really do need it the most. We want to continue to see people in the top 100 who are coming from South America, from Asia, and we want to see more players from Africa coming through to the top of the game.” Finances will remain difficult for lower-ranked players. They usually cover their own expenses, which can be high given the international landscape of the game. In an I.T.F. calculation that accounted for only minimal expenses, the ranking point at which players could expect to stop losing money on their careers was No. 336 for men and No. 253 for women. Aside from prize-money discrepancies at many levels of the game, female players have fewer tournaments to choose from and therefore travel more, resulting in higher expenses. Precarious as that level of the tour can be, the sport’s leaders have repeatedly said that the lower levels of the game should be a viable proving ground for those aspiring to the main tour, but not a place for players to comfortably take up residence for their entire careers. The ATP Challenger Tour and the Futures tour “are developmental tours,” said Eric Butorac, the president of the ATP Player Council. He added: “We don’t want a guy going to Futures and Challengers for 15 months and then quitting due to lack of finances, when they were actually moving up and getting closer to the ATP Tour.” For the past few years, the ATP Player Council has negotiated significant prize-money increases at the Grand Slam events, focusing on early-round and qualifying losers. But the 14 percent annual increase at Masters events will mostly make those at the top even more comfortable. The top 50 will be affected most because the mandatory nature of the elite events makes the entry cutoff higher than at any other level. (There was also a 3.5 percent increase at 250-level events, the lowest of the three rungs of the main tour.) Butorac said that even with the pay increase, those tournaments were getting an incredible deal. “The Masters product is the best product in tennis,” Butorac said. “You get every player in the top 40 coming to your city. On the open market, bringing in just two or three top players can sometimes cost more than the total prize money of an event. At a Masters, you get Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, Murray; you get all of these young stars like Dimitrov and Nishikori. The product is amazing.” The Masters tournaments initially proposed a more modest 5 percent raise for players, while market studies commissioned by the players concluded that they deserved 17 percent. The tournaments are now protesting the decision. Representatives from the four Masters events in North America did not comment on the ATP’s announcement. Six of the ATP Masters events are held alongside concurrent WTA events. Women are paid equal prize money in Indian Wells, Calif.; Miami; and Madrid, so these ATP increases are expected to result in commensurate raises on the women’s side. The men earn significantly more at the other three Masters events, with the champion in Rome, Canada and Cincinnati receiving at least $157,900 more than the women’s champion. After helping to obtain a victory for the top stars, who drive the most fans and money into the sport, Butorac is turning his attention to the lower levels. “My top priority in 2015 is improve the Challenger Tour,” he said. “I want to help out the Futures tour as well, but that is more complicated since it is run by the I.T.F. I think it is so important that we continue to build the base of tennis. However, if fans are not paying to watch these levels of tennis, then where does the money come from?”
