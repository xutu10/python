Dynamo Moscow beat host Estoril, 2-1, and Legia Warsaw beat Metalist Kharkiv, 1-0. Tottenham scored a 5-1 home victory over the Greek side Asteras Tripolis behind a hat trick by the young striker Harry Kane. After keeper Hugo Lloris was sent off in the 87th minute, Kane went into goal, giving up Asteras’s only goal. A game between the former Czechoslovak rivals Slovan Bratislava and Sparta Prague was interrupted for more than half an hour because of fighting among fans. Visiting Sparta won, 3-0.
