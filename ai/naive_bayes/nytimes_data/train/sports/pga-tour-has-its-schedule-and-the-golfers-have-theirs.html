PGA Tour Has Its Schedule, and Players Have Theirs
Led by Tiger Woods, five of the top eight golfers on the money list made fewer than 20 starts last year, balancing the demands of a wraparound schedule with the desire to stay fresh.

ATLANTA — The PGA Tour has become such a ceaseless march that the winner of the FedEx Cup ought to be awarded a gold-plated treadmill. The new season will start three weeks after this one officially concludes Sunday at East Lake Golf Club. The fortunate few competing in the Ryder Cup have one week to recharge before the ringing of the opening bell at the Frys.com Open, a sufficient amount of time only if the players were laptops or electric cars. Tim Finchem, the PGA Tour commissioner, said Tuesday that he was pleased with the overall reaction of players and sponsors to the wraparound schedule that was unveiled last October. He acknowledged that the strength of the fields in the fall were a concern as the tour’s boldface names take a break that the schedule does not allow. “If that continues, it’s a small problem to have given all the positives that the wraparound season has generated,” Finchem said. He added, “Taking the game around the country, getting to more markets, is in the interest of the sport, it’s in the interest of our model, which is generating playing opportunities and financial benefits to players, but also growing the game.” So if the fans in Napa, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Jackson, Miss.; three tour stops in October and November, can relate to the basketball fans in Miami who went to see their Heat play the Spurs only to find out the three biggest stars for San Antonio were home resting, oh, well. The motto for the fall schedule: These guys you do not recognize are good! “Players figure out their own schedules,” Finchem said. “They’re not under any requirement to play any particular schedule. And they’re all different in the way they approach it.” The top performers on the PGA Tour last year were all remarkably similar in how they attacked the schedule, taking a less-is-more approach. Led by Tiger Woods, five of the top eight on the money list made fewer than 20 starts. The top-ranked Rory McIlroy has played in 20 events in 2014. Five of his starts have come in European Tour events, and he has a half-dozen global events left, including in Australia and China. He played 25 events in 2013 and sees fewer in his future. “Over the next few years I’ll probably let it come down a little bit,” McIlroy said. “Maybe make it between 20 and 23, something like that. Just try to stay as fresh as possible and give myself the best possible chance each and every week that I tee it up to play well.” If not for his top ranking and European Tour roots, McIlroy already would have whittled his schedule. It is golf’s good fortune that its top performer this year is also one of its best ambassadors. “There’s a couple of events during the year that you feel obliged to play just because of where you’re from or support a different tour,” McIlroy said. He added: “And I know being the No. 1 player in the world, you have a responsibility to play around the world and try to grow the game. I’m playing places that they don’t necessarily see you play throughout the year.” The 29 players in this week’s field at the Tour Championship have averaged 22 starts worldwide. On the short end is Adam Scott with 16, two more than Jason Day, who intended to play more but missed more than a month with a thumb injury. With the players, most of whom have been playing high-stakes golf nonstop for the past one or two months, wheezing to the finish line, it raises the question: Why don’t they pace themselves better? Scott, who took February off, made one start apiece in April and July and two each in May and June, said, “It sounds good, to play less, but it’s hard to do.” The marathon schedule rewards players who have a miler’s closing kick. It takes confidence to take much of the fall and winter off while the rabbits — a role filled this season by Jimmy Walker, who won three times from October to February — race out to a large points lead in the FedEx Cup standings. “You have to be committed to it,” Scott said. In 18 starts, Bubba Watson performed well enough to control his FedEx Cup championship destiny. He is the third of five players who are assured of earning the $10 million bonus with a victory. (Chris Kirk, Billy Horschel, McIlroy and Hunter Mahan are the others.) Watson, who made one start in May and two in July, said: “There’s 42 great tournaments, but my body isn’t going to let me play in all of them and so for me I have to pick and choose. I don’t really play good in the middle of the year, when it gets really hot, so I use that time to spend with my family.” He has watched other elite golfers play events when they would rather be anywhere else because of sponsor commitments, something he has vowed never to do. “I wouldn’t let them dictate my schedule,” Watson said, referring to his corporate sponsors. “They’d rather I probably put goofy videos on Twitter to get my name out there than go out and struggle in a golf tournament.” Kirk, the FedEx Cup points leader, has captured two of his three career tour titles in the past 12 months. His success has made his schedule harder to manage because he is eligible for, or receiving invitations to, events he never played before. As an independent contractor, Kirk can take time off whenever he wants. He would love it if the tour went dark for a month or two, forcing everyone to take a break. Because as long as there is a fall schedule, there will be fast starters like Walker who will keep Kirk on the treadmill. “I just feel like if you don’t play the tournaments in the fall, you’re so far behind it would put pressure on you in the spring,” Kirk said. In 24 starts in 2014, Kirk has three top-10 finishes: a win, a second and a fourth. So even though he is leading the points standings, he knows he is not yet the equal of McIlroy, Watson or Scott. “I currently feel like my game, when it’s good, I can compete with anyone,” he said. “But it’s not good quite as often as those guys. So they sort of have the luxury of being able to just play every now and then knowing they’re probably going to play really well whenever they do.” Kirk added, “Maybe five years from now I’ll be comfortable playing 22 events and still think I can get myself into a position like I am right now.”
