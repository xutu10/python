Michael McAdoo, a former North Carolina player, has filed a lawsuit against the university, saying it failed to provide him and other athletes a quality education by guiding them toward sham classes. Online court records showed a lawsuit seeking class-action status was filed last week in United States District Court in Charlotte, N.C. McAdoo’s lawsuit says that football coaches guaranteed him a good education, but that he was ultimately guided to consider three options, one of which was African-American Studies — a curriculum that formed the basis of the scandal.
