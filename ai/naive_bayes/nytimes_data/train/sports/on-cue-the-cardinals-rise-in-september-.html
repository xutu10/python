On Cue, the Cardinals Rise in September 
For five months, St. Louis never held first place alone, but when the Milwaukee Brewers went into a skid, the Cardinals were there.

ST. LOUIS — The monthly records of the  March-April: 15-14. May: 15-12. June: 14-13. July: 13-11. August: 16-13. Such a pitcher might not stand out, but he would reliably keep his team in games. So it has been with these Cardinals. For five months, while the  “This team, they’ve been there before, and they knew if they could keep it close, the games that matter are the late August and September games,” said reliever Pat Neshek, a newcomer this season. “That’s what we kind of said all year: ‘Let’s keep it close and not panic.’ We stayed close.” The Cardinals won the World Series in 2011, a wild card in 2012 and the N.L. pennant last season. Widely perceived as the division favorites this season, they entered the weekend in first place, right where they had expected. But the path there was steady, not soaring. Just as the Brewers wilted, the Cardinals finally got hot, winning 12 of 16 games through last Sunday. It fueled hope that the team could finally be peaking at a time of year when it always seems to play well. “In the beginning, we struggled a little bit offensively,” shortstop Jhonny Peralta said. “Now we’re doing it together with defense, hitting and pitching. That’s what makes us a better team. But the whole time, we had confidence. We knew this was coming around.” So it has, but the offense remains a concern. General Manager John Mozeliak said he expected some regression in run production after last season, when the Cardinals hit an unsustainable .330 with runners in scoring position. But he did not expect the team to rank so low in runs per game (26th in the majors, at 3.81 entering Saturday) and home runs (29th in the majors, ahead of only Kansas City, with 101). “Now, having said all that, we did have some really positive starting pitching during that rough offensive stretch,” Mozeliak said. “And that kept us in games, so even though we don’t have a very positive run differential, being almost neutral sort of explains our year in a lot of ways: We were in a ton of games, a lot of one-run games, and we were able to end up on the right side of those enough.” The Cardinals’ staff leads the N.L. in shutouts with 21, the most for the team since 1968. As usual, Adam Wainwright, at 19-9, has been the staff ace. Lance Lynn has lowered his earned run average by more than a run, to 2.68, and Shelby Miller is finishing strong after fading at the end of last season. “They’re not afraid to pitch,” said Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina, who missed seven weeks at midseason with a thumb injury. “They go right after people. They’ve got some good talent; they’ve obviously got good fastballs, and they’re gaining more experience. That’s the key — when you get experience, you get confidence.” Mozeliak acquired two more experienced starters at the trading deadline: Justin Masterson, who has struggled and now rarely pitches, and John Lackey, who stabilized the rotation in August. Lackey beat the Cardinals in the World Series clincher for Boston last fall and brings a strong October pedigree. “I also think he’s been good for us in the sense of his attitude, just the way he goes about things,” Mozeliak said. “He’s got a little Carp in him.” By that, Mozeliak meant Chris Carpenter, the ace of the Cardinals’ title teams in 2006 and 2011. There can be few higher compliments around the Cardinals, who traded outfielder Allen Craig and starter Joe Kelly to get Lackey. Lackey has battled a dead arm lately, and Michael Wacha, a sensation last fall, has dealt with a stress reaction in his shoulder. If one or both are healthy this postseason, the Cardinals could match up well with any other rotation. But they have to get more from their hitters. At nearly every point in the season, Mozeliak said, the Cardinals have kept the lineup respectable because just enough hitters have been hot. But he added that he hoped Manager Mike Matheny could find time to rest Matt Carpenter, Matt Holliday, Jon Jay and Peralta down the stretch. To do so, the Cardinals must pull away from the pack in the Central. They have not quite done so, but by now it feels inevitable. They are, after all, the Cardinals. “We feel like the club’s never gotten to where we think it’s capable of,” Mozeliak said. “It may never get there. But we may, and it’s exciting to think about.” Once again, it seems, the ever-reliable Cardinals have given themselves a chance. The Case for Waiting Masahiro Tanaka is set to return to the mound for the Yankees on Sunday, seemingly with the threat of Tommy John surgery hovering over his every pitch. Tanaka has not pitched in the majors since July 8 because of a partly torn ulnar collateral ligament, and he has rehabilitated the injury rather than undergo the surgery widely believed to be inevitable. Perhaps it is, but the Cardinals’ Adam Wainwright is proof that elbow reconstruction may indeed be far in the future. Wainwright said he first felt elbow pain in middle school, then was found to have a partial U.C.L. tear as a high school junior. A strengthening program allowed him to pitch without pain for six years, he said, until doctors discovered another partial tear while he was in Class AAA. He never felt inhibited from using any pitches. “The second time I did it, I was given like a 60 percent chance to come back healthy and pitch like I was pitching,” Wainwright said. “The rehab was great, I healed up — and six years is six years.” Wainwright finally underwent Tommy John surgery in 2011 and missed that season. But he was 29 then — a long way from high school — and said he was glad he did not rush to the operating table. “You don’t want to have surgery unless you have to,” Wainwright said. “We’ve been given ligaments and tendons that are much better than repaired ligaments and tendons. Any time they’re drilling holes in bones and putting things in, there’s risk involved. So don’t get it unless you need it.” Steady for the Rockies  Carlos Frias of the Los Angeles Dodgers had a historically rough day at Coors Field on Wednesday, becoming the first pitcher in the last 100 years to allow at least 10 hits and eight earned runs in less than an inning of work. Lost in the rout, though, was the performance of Frias’s pitching opponent, Jorge De La Rosa of the Colorado Rockies. De La Rosa spun six shutout innings, allowing two hits and improving his record to 14-11 with a 4.14 E.R.A. De La Rosa, who has 30 victories the last two seasons, is that rare pitcher who thrives in Denver and is eager to stick around. He quietly signed a two-year, $25 million contract extension this month, giving the Rockies, who have used 15 starters this season, at least one reliable arm to build on.
