Tom Coughlin Politely Calls for Giants to Make Big Plays
The Giants have completed only three passes of 30 yards or more, which is tied with the Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs for the fewest in the N.F.L., and is a far cry from the play of Indianapolis.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —  Please make plays, Coach  A similar edict was voiced by General Manager Jerry Reese on Monday, a little more forcefully, and it is obvious that the Giants have one objective for Monday night’s home game against the  That is because, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Giants (3-4) have completed only three passes of 30 yards or more, which is tied with the Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs for the fewest in the N.F.L. The Giants are also one of only four teams without a run longer than 23 yards. And they are 26th in the league in yards gained after making a catch, with a total of 783. That is a far cry from the play of Indianapolis, a well-tuned offensive juggernaut that enters the week second in points per game (31.3), and first in total yards (452.3) and passing yards (336.5) per contest. To keep up, the Giants know they will have to improve on some of their paltry statistics. “We’d like to see the ball in the end zone more, however it gets there,” Coughlin said. “You’ve got to protect the passer; you’ve got to kind of do all of the things that we tried to structure in order to do. We’ve gotten good numbers out of the quarterback position. We need even better.” At least there is a template for making that happen, thanks to Ben Roethlisberger and the Pittsburgh Steelers, who obliterated the Colts’ defense for 639 yards (522 by Roethlisberger alone) in a 51-34 win. Indianapolis (5-3) had previously appeared to be having a stellar defensive season. The Giants now know that the Colts can be dismantled, because they have it all on film. What Pittsburgh did so brilliantly — and what the Giants think they need to do better — is what Coughlin has been calling “playing above the X’s and O’s.” What does that mean exactly? Well, there were a variety of answers in the locker room Thursday. According to safety Antrel Rolle, it means playing more instinctively. “Just go out and play ball,” Rolle said. “There’s no algebra involved.” Eli Manning interpreted Coughlin’s concept as meaning that players can ad-lib beyond what the playbook dictates. “I have to go through my progressions and my reads and find the open guy, but sometimes you get to the end of the progression and no one is open,” Manning said. Jason Pierre-Paul put it all a different way. “The playoffs have started,” he said.
