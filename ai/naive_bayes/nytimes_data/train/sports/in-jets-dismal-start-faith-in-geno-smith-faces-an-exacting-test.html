In Jets’ Dismal Start, Faith in Geno Smith Faces an Exacting Test
The Jets’ offense held a players-only meeting to vent some frustration over the team’s poor start to the season.
===
FLORHAM PARK, N.J. —   “Barring injury,” Ryan said, “I’m going to be shocked if this kid doesn’t take off.” Five weeks have passed since this conversation. On Monday, after the team’s third consecutive loss,  “I’ve just allowed some of those things to happen, which I can’t let happen,” Smith said. The theme of regret, of remorse, filtered throughout One Jets Drive on Monday. Smith again apologized for cursing at a heckling fan as he walked toward the Jets’ locker room after  “It’s been frustrating at times because you’re giving everything you have,” Ryan said, “and unfortunately it hasn’t been good enough these last three weeks.” Players-only meetings are not held when a team is winning, when its quarterback is thriving and harnessing his emotions. They are held when a team scores three touchdowns in its last 10 quarters and drops six passes and is called for four false-start penalties on offense, a transgression that Ryan, for a home game, considered inexcusable. They are held when a quarterback misfires to open receivers, bypasses running room for 6-yard completions on third-and-9, and makes poor decisions and worse throws. The meeting was helpful, Smith said, because it allowed players to vent, to express their feelings — in a positive manner, he stressed — in private. Not, say, in full view of exasperated fans, some of whom spent part of their Sunday booing Smith and chanting for  “It can’t happen,” Ryan told Smith on Monday. Smith said, “I should never let that situation get escalated that far.” Smith had conducted himself with professionalism in his previous 19 games — before, during and afterward. When praising him, teammates and coaches have lauded Smith’s composure, a constant no matter how dire the circumstances. His decision to lash out Sunday, however provoked, reflected poorly on him, as he said. It also, for the first time, invited the perception that all of this — the losing, the pressure of the job, the turnovers upon turnovers, the presence of Vick — could be affecting him. Smith disagreed, as did Ryan. “It’s not appropriate —you’ve just got to handle it — but I don’t think it’s the other pressure,” said Ryan, who was fined $75,000 by the league for yelling an obscenity at a fan as he walked off the field at halftime of a game against New England in 2011. “I think it’s more the frustration part of it.” Some of that frustration might derive from the Jets’ hope, and, to a degree, their expectation, that Smith would no longer be making these mistakes. This many, at least. Since last season ended, Ryan, his coaching staff and the offense have spoken highly of Smith’s improvements, and that enthusiasm buoyed the Jets during training camp. It was apparent that Smith was a better quarterback than he was last season, and that remains true, regardless of the Jets’ struggles so far. He has not regressed. But it is possible, and only the Jets know for sure, that Smith may not be improving quickly enough. As with Mark Sanchez before him, Smith’s encouraging moments are often overshadowed, or nullified, by critical mistakes, such as his two fourth-quarter turnovers Sunday. The only quarterbacks with a lower passer rating this season than Smith are Jake Locker, Josh McCown and Matt Cassel, who are all injured and did not play in Week 4. “He has to live through this; he has to fight through this,” Vick said. Smith will get that chance. Ryan reiterated his support Monday, saying that Smith would be “one of the main reasons” why the Jets would rebound from their ugly start. It is natural to wonder, though, whether Ryan will consider a change if Smith and the Jets continue to flop. Asked if he could rescue the Jets, Vick tried to deflect the question. “I’m only one person,” he said. “I can’t answer your question until I actually go out there and play three or four games, and then maybe we could talk about it. As of right now, I can’t say I’ll be the difference maker.” The Jets’ quarterback situation could come into sharper focus next week, after their game in San Diego against the soaring Chargers. Maybe that is when the Jets will catch the ball, throw accurate passes, convert in the red zone. Maybe that is when the kid takes off. EXTRA POINTS Fullback Tommy Bohanon fractured his clavicle Sunday and is out indefinitely. ... The Jets released Jalen Saunders, a fourth-round draft pick, and cornerback LeQuan Lewis and added two receivers: T. J. Graham, a speedster who caught a touchdown with Buffalo against them last season, and Chris Owusu, whose signing probably indicated that the ankle injury David Nelson sustained Sunday was serious.
