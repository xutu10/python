More Than Meets the Eye in Hobart Fleet
The boats that will set off from Sydney on Friday come in many shapes and sizes, and their skippers have many different philosophies.

Peter Isler will sail this Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race in the relative comfort of a 100-foot supermaxi yacht that is capable of covering the 630 nautical miles from start to finish in roughly two days. Other sailors and boats will require quite a bit more time. “I go on the website, and I think, ‘Wow! Is that boat really doing the Hobart race?”’ said Isler, the veteran American navigator on Rio 100. Hobart boats come in many shapes and sizes, and their skippers come with many different philosophies, with one even choosing to block out the clock. “What I’m after quite simply is the emotional connection to get the most out of going to sea,” said Sean Langman, whose 30-foot, or nine-meter, Maluka was built in 1932 and is absolutely no threat to the supermaxis for line honors. “The most sensible thing you can do when you can go to sea is take your watch off. You should not be constrained by the things we are usually constrained by on land.” “What has happened recently is that people are staring at computer programs and trying to figure out what’s happening next, which is obviously a great advantage rather than using a simple method of getting from point A to point B,” he added. “People look at us and use the term ‘crazy’ quite often. ‘Why would you do a race that takes five days?’ they ask. And the reason why is we get the full experience, every single weather condition, and the challenges are heightened because of that.” This will be the 70th edition of the Hobart, the premier offshore race in the Southern Hemisphere and a rite of the Christmas holidays in Australia with its Dec. 26 start in Sydney Harbor. With 117 entries, this should be — barring late withdrawals — the biggest fleet since the 50th anniversary race in 1994. As usual, the primary focus is on the biggest boats, those capable of crossing the finish line in Tasmania first and those with crews numbering more than 20 and with very wealthy owners. Men like Jim Clark, 70, an American billionaire whose new and innovative supermaxi, Comanche, is the most recent threat to Wild Oats XI, the Australian yacht owned by the Oatley family that has dominated the high end of the Hobart for nearly a decade. Wild Oats has taken line honors in seven of the last nine years and also won the overall trophy in 2005 and in 2012. It was in 2012 that Wild Oats trumped its own race record, finishing in one day, 18 hours, 23 minutes and 12 seconds. “I don’t mind pushing the envelope; I’ve done it before,” said Clark, a co-founder of Netscape Communications. “It’s fun. You know, if I wanted to guarantee the high success of winning this race, I’d get Reichel/Pugh to design a better version of what they have and it would be narrow, long and lighter, because technology has evolved in the last eight or nine years since they built Wild Oats.” Instead, Clark and the French naval architectural firm VPLP and the designer Guillaume Verdier went for a significantly wider lightweight design. “Comanche is almost twice as wide at the back of the boat as Wild Oats,” Clark said, speaking by telephone from Sydney. “I think it’s going to be fascinating. I don’t think there are any slam dunks here. I don’t think there’s a guarantee they can win it or we can win it. But I do think we’ll be the top two boats, although Perpetual Loyal could be a wild card. But both of us are just chock full of professionals. Loyal has some celebrities on board as part of their fundraising efforts.” Owned by Anthony Bell, the supermaxi Perpetual Loyal seeks to raise money for the Loyal Foundation. But Bell’s philosophy is that the best way to do that is to have a competitive boat, and Perpetual Loyal is again one of the favorites in this year’s race. There is also the rebuilt Rio 100, on which Isler will be navigator, and the rebuilt Ragamuffin, owned by the Australian Syd Fischer, who is now as much a part of the landscape of the Hobart as Bass Strait and the River Derwent. At age 87, Fischer will be the oldest skipper in the race’s history. He is 17 years older than Clark, who is still debating whether his ailing ankles will allow him to climb on board his new toy for the race to Tasmania. “I need ankle replacements,” Clark said. “I just don’t want to be in the way.”
