Norway dominated its home World Cup cross-country skiing races on Saturday, with Martin Johnsrud Sundby and Therese Johaug leading podium sweeps in the men’s and women’s events in Lillehammer. Sundby won the men’s 10-kilometer freestyle event in 22 minutes 55.8 seconds, with the Finn Haagen Krogh finishing 2.2 seconds behind and Sjur Rothe placing third. Sweden’s Calle Halfvarsson led early but finished fourth. In the women’s five-kilometer event, Johaug finished in 12:33.7, 0.3 seconds ahead of the six-time Olympic champion Marit Bjorgen. Heidi Weng was more than 10 seconds behind in third. Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla was fourth. GERMAN WINS IN NORDIC COMBINED Frenzel was third after the ski jump, then finished the 10-kilometer cross-country race in 25 minutes 1.9 seconds, beating Riessle by 2.7 seconds. The two Germans left a threesome of Norwegians far behind. Jan Schmid finished in 25:14.2 for third, followed by Magnus Moan and Havard Klemetsen. Klemetsen won the ski jump portion with a 142-meter jump, followed by Sindre Ure Stvik of Norway and Frenzel. Three Germans lead the overall standings after two events — Johannes Rydzek and Riessle each have 120 points, while Frenzel has 108. Rydzek won the opening event but was 13th Saturday. FOURCADE RALLIES TO WIN BIATHLON  Fourcade, a double Olympic champion at the Sochi Games in Russia, finished 81st in the men’s 20-kilometer individual race on Wednesday but led from the start in Saturday’s sprint. His advantage continued to grow until he crossed the finish line in 24:46.6 seconds, 28.3 seconds ahead of Ondrej Moravec of the Czech Republic. Jakov Fak of Slovenia was another 0.4 seconds back in third. Moravec and Fak also shot clean but could not match Fourcade’s speed.
