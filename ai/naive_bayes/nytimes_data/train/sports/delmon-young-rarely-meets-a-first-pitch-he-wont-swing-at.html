Delmon Young Rarely Meets a First Pitch He Won't Swing At
Delmon Young tends to swing at the first pitch he sees, and when it comes to hitting in autumn, he has few peers among active players.

DETROIT —  Baltimore’s Delmon Young answers most questions with a deadpan expression that can make it difficult to tell whether he is pulling your leg. Before the  “I try to hit a home run every time,” he said. “I try to pull it, every pitch.” In an era of batters taking strikes and working counts, Young — playing in the postseason for a sixth consecutive year, with a fourth team — is an anomaly, a hitter who rarely lets a first pitch pass without swinging mightily. And when it comes to hitting in the cool of autumn, Young has few peers among active players. Pinch-hitting for third baseman Ryan Flaherty in  Young said he had approached the batter’s box anticipating that the first pitch would be over the plate. “He just walked a guy and has the bases loaded,” Young said of Soria. “He has to throw strike one.” And strike one is Young’s favorite. Since arriving in the majors with Tampa Bay in 2006 as a celebrated 20-year-old prospect, Young has swung at the first pitch of an at-bat more than any other. In his career Young has batted .354, with 27 home runs, on first pitches, according to  “He’s a very dangerous first-ball fastball hitter,” said Tigers closer Joe Nathan, Young’s former teammate in Minnesota. “You tend to see a lot of guys go off-speed. But I played with him, too. I know he can hit off-speed pitches. You’ve got to make quality pitches, especially early in the bat.” Although Young saw playoff action with the Twins in 2009 and 2010, he emerged as an October force after he was traded to Detroit in August 2011, hitting nine home runs over the next three postseasons. His five homers in 2011 — three against the Yankees in a division series — set a Tigers record. In 2012 he victimized the Yankees again, in the American League Championship Series, hitting two homers, with six runs batted in, to win the series’ the Most Valuable Player award. And in last year’s wild-card game, Young, again playing for Tampa Bay, homered for the first run in a 4-0 victory over Cleveland. So why is someone with Young’s postseason résumé on his fourth team in three years? Young  Young signed with Philadelphia for the 2013 season. Designated for assignment that August, he signed with the Rays. The Orioles then signed him to a minor league deal in January. “If you look at Delmon, he would be the first to tell you some of his challenges have been self-inflicted,” Baltimore Manager Buck Showalter said. “But you look at him purely statistically, and you go, Why is this guy available? “Like I told him, none of us like to have our lives judged by our worst decision. And the big thing is, if you get an opportunity, you had better run through that door. And he has.” Young, 29, batted .302 in 83 games this season, making his mark as a pinch-hitter (going 10 for 20) and a late-game replacement (batting .400 in games he did not start). Orioles center fielder Adam Jones said Young tried hardest against teams that had given up on him. “He wants to hit against Detroit and Minnesota,” Jones said, adding: “I don’t think it’s a vendetta, but he wants to do good. He wants to succeed for his team and for us.” Young partly disputed that analysis. “They did me a favor,” Young said of the Tigers, now his opponent. “They got me out of Minnesota, and I got to play on a big stage with them. I couldn’t have been more happy to play with Detroit. I loved it here.”
