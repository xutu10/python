Stephen Curry scored 40 points, and the Golden State Warriors beat  “You just feel a rhythm,” said Curry, who was 8 for 24 in his previous two games. “I had guys set some great screens early to kind of get me going. You start finding shots and it feels good.” Golden State scored 14 straight points to open a 107-95 lead with 2 minutes 50 seconds to go. Curry and Klay Thompson capped the run with consecutive 3-pointers. Thompson had 24 points for the Warriors, who shot 57 percent. Curry was 12 for 19 from the field, including 8 for 11 from 3-point range. Chris Bosh scored 26 points for Miami. James Ennis’s dunk with 9:11 left was the Heat’s last field goal. HAWKS 106, WIZARDS 102 Scott and Mack scored Atlanta’s first 16 points of the final period, igniting a 22-5 run that built a 14-point lead before the Wizards hit a spate of 3-pointers to make the final score close. Scott finished with 17 points in 23 minutes, and Mack had 13 in 19 for the Hawks, who have won six of eight. John Wall had 21 points and 13 assists for the Wizards, who committed a season-high 25 turnovers. KINGS 99, PELICANS 89 Omri Casspi also scored 22 for Sacramento, which has won three in a row.
