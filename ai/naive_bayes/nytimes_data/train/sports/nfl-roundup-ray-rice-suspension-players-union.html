N.F.L. Players Union Appeals Ray Rice’s Longer Suspension
The N.F.L. Players Association said Rice’s indefinite suspension was not part of a “fair and impartial process.”

The N.F.L. Players Association filed an appeal on behalf of Ray Rice on Tuesday night to protect the due process rights of all players, the union said. It said that Rice’s indefinite suspension by the league last week, which came after the release of video showing him punching his fiancée, was not “a fair and impartial process, including the role of the office of the Commissioner of the N.F.L.” The union asked that an independent arbitrator hear Rice’s case because Commissioner Roger Goodell and his staff “will be essential witnesses in the proceeding and thus cannot serve as impartial arbitrators.” The union said that an employee cannot be “punished twice for the same action when all of the relevant facts were available to the employer at the time of the first punishment.” Goodell suspended Rice indefinitely after the video was released, but suspended him for two games in July for the same episode. Goodell has left open the possibility that Rice could be reinstated in the future. Under the collective bargaining agreement between the league and union, a hearing date must be set within 10 days of an appeal. MORE INJURIES FOR GIANTS  But the worst news from the team was a report on middle linebacker Jon Beason, who on Sunday aggravated the right foot injury that sidelined him the entire preseason. The team disclosed no timetable for Beason’s return and indicated he might see the foot specialist Dr. Robert Anderson in North Carolina. Beason, a leader of the defense and a key to the unit’s resurgence late last season, missed 12 weeks the last time he made that trip to see Anderson. At the least, it appears Beason will be sidelined a few weeks. The Giants are already thin at linebacker because the promising rookie Devon Kennard, whom the team had been counting on to play considerable minutes, is out with a hamstring strain. To replace Beason, the Giants could move the strongside linebacker Jameel McClain to the middle of the defense and promote the reserve linebacker Spencer Paysinger to play outside, where McClain has been patrolling. When Beason left Sunday’s loss to Arizona, he was replaced by Mark Herzlich, who struggled, especially in pass coverage. The acquisition of Beason from the Carolina Panthers last season was viewed as a pivotal move for the Giants’ defense because he helped to solidify the run defense and brought a veteran presence to an ineffectual corps of linebackers. For Jernigan, the end of his season may also mean the end of his Giants career. A free agent at the end of the season, Jernigan was a 2011 third-round draft choice for the Giants who has never produced as the team expected.  BENGALS TIGHT END IS OUT  GORDON GETS PROBATION
