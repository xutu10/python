Andy Murray Is Hitting Major Bumps After Minor Surgery
Murray has struggled since undergoing what his management team called “minor back surgery” in September 2013, but has shown flashes of his old self at the ATP World Tour Finals, where he will play Roger Federer on Thursday.

LONDON —  The way this year has unfolded for  While he did not face jeers from the crowd here two months after  Murray, who had won three titles in six weeks to secure his spot in the tournament, delivered a baffling performance against the  When it looked as if Murray might be vulnerable Tuesday against Milos Raonic, who had won three of their last four matches, Murray won in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5. The victory kept Murray in contention to advance to the semifinals ahead of his match Thursday against second-ranked Roger Federer. “Hopefully I can get through the group and keep going,” Murray said. “If not, playing against Roger is a good way for me to finish the year.” Murray could be forgiven for running on empty. To say it has been a draining season would be similar to describing Raonic as simply a decent server. Since last year’s victory at Wimbledon, where Murray ended 77 years of futility by British men, he has been limited by physical ailments and slowed by inconsistent results. He had back surgery in September 2013, which forced him to skip last year’s World Tour Finals. A statement from Murray’s management team in the days before the procedure called it “minor back surgery,” but Greg Rusedski, a former teammate of Murray’s on the British Davis Cup team, said he had suspected that recapturing top form would not happen instantaneously. Rusedski endured back troubles during his own career. “I’ve never heard of such a thing as minor back surgery — it’s always difficult,” Rusedski said. “I think we’ll know where Andy is at in 2015.” To add to Murray’s challenges, Ivan Lendl, by Murray’s side for both of his Grand Slam titles, left the coaching entourage in March. Murray, 27, appeared ready to flourish earlier this year when he reached  But his title defense at Wimbledon ended with a  After losing to Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals of the United States Open, Murray sank to  “I wanted to try and play matches and get back to winning matches,” Murray said. He told Mauresmo and another member of his coaching team, Daniel Vallverdu, “I didn’t care if it was a future or challenger.” Murray did not have to go that far down the tennis ladder, instead playing in Shenzhen, China, and then in Beijing, Shanghai, Vienna, Valencia and Paris. He compiled a 20-3 record and won titles in Shenzhen, Vienna and Valencia. Murray even saved a combined 10 match points against Tommy Robredo in the finals in Shenzhen and Valencia, and he wept in Shenzhen when he ended his title drought. The lengthy trip paid dividends: Murray qualified for London and climbed to sixth in the rankings. Just as significant, his back held up. Then came the hiccup against Nishikori, who had not won a set against Murray in their three previous matches. “Some of the things that happened this year, you just have to learn from them,” said Brad Gilbert, a former coach of Murray’s. “You can’t beat yourself up about it.” Gilbert added: “There was a lot going on this year. But at the end of the year he seemed to be playing good tennis. I think he’ll be going hard in the off-season. It will be the first time that he’ll be spending an off-season with Mauresmo, so they can work on parts of his game.” This noteworthy season, though, is not over yet. Murray has an 0-8 record this season against Federer, Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, fellow members of the Big Four. But considering his unpredictable results this week, Murray cannot be counted out against Federer. Whatever happens on Thursday and in the rest of the tournament, Rusedski said it would not alter his view of Murray’s year. “To finish in the top 10 again, maybe in the top six or seven, is a fantastic year considering the back surgery,” he said.
