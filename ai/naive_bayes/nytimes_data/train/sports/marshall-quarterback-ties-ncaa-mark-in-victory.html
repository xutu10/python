Marshall Quarterback Ties N.C.A.A. Mark in Victory
Rakeem Cato equaled an all-division record for consecutive games with a scoring pass (46) during a rout of Northern Illinois in the Boca Raton Bowl.

Rakeem Cato capped a record-setting career by tying an N.C.A.A. mark for touchdown passes, throwing for three scores to help Marshall beat Northern Illinois, 52-23, at the inaugural Boca Raton Bowl in Florida on Tuesday night. Cato extended his streak of throwing at least one touchdown pass to 46 consecutive games. That tied the N.C.A.A. all-division record set by Central Washington’s Mike Reilly. As usual, Cato’s favorite target was his fellow senior, Tommy Shuler, who had 18 receptions for 185 yards and a score. Shuler broke the Conference USA record for career catches with 322. Cato increased his season total to a team-record 40 touchdown passes. He threw for scores of 6 yards to Shuler, 11 to Angelo Jean-Louis and 27 to Deon-Tay McManus. A.P. HONORS MARIOTA Mariota won the A.P. vote in a landslide similar to the one in which he claimed the Heisman Trophy. He received 49 of the 54 votes submitted by the A.P. Top 25 media panel.
