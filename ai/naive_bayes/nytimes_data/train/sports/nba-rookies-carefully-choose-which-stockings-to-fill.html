N.B.A. Rookies Carefully Choose Which Stockings to Fill
Around the holidays, young players who have recently earned their first big paychecks face pressure to buy gifts for family members, friends and hangers-on.

After a practice early this week, Knicks Coach Derek Fisher recalled his first Christmas as an  Christmas would never be the same. And not always in a good way. Fisher abruptly transitioned from being a starving college student to being an N.B.A. player. “It changes literally overnight,” Fisher said. “One Christmas, everybody’s trying to help you get $20. The next Christmas, everybody expects you to give them at least $20.” I’ve always wondered how N.B.A. rookies handle the pressure of Christmas, especially in an age of big salaries for teenage players. With so many stories about freeloaders, hangers-on, false friends and high-maintenance entourages, the expectations stemming from sudden wealth can easily complicate matters. “It’s definitely hard early in your career to establish the boundaries in terms of gift-giving and how big your list is,” Fisher said. “There seems to just be an expectation from many, whether they’re in your house or on your street or in your county, to get a gift. It’s definitely a life-changing experience.” Over the last couple of days, I spoke to several rookies about their approach to Christmas this year — their first as N.B.A. players. The consensus was that by far their biggest concern had been simply making it into the league. Because they had been able to do that, they said, gift-giving was a new, delicate problem. Still, they thought they would be able to deal with it. The Knicks’ Cleanthony Early, a second-round pick out of Wichita State in June, said that the pressure to share good fortune with others was what you made of it, and that he had done his best to make it disappear. “The only person I really have to take care of is my mom,” said Early, who is recovering from a knee injury. Early’s older brother died in a drowning accident four years ago, leaving three children, and Early said he would also provide for them this holiday. I asked him if others were expecting gifts. “As far as trying to impress everyone or buy everyone something, I just can’t do that,” Early said. “People demanding and wanting things out of you can be pressure and can cause stress. If you let it, it can eat you alive.” Nets Coach Lionel Hollins was a rookie in 1975, 16 years before Early was born. “Christmas was every day,” Hollins recalled. “ ‘Can you pay my light bill? Can you co-sign for this car? Can you co-sign for some furniture?’ It wasn’t just Christmas.” I was surprised at how matter-of-fact the young players I talked to were about keeping their circle of relationships fairly small and tight. Perhaps they are the exceptions, or perhaps young players have gotten wiser about whom they allow to get close to them. The players I spoke with seemed to favor people who had been a part of their journey for a long time, particularly family members. Erick Green of the Denver Nuggets, who like Early is 23, played in Europe last season after he was selected in the second round of the 2013 draft. On Tuesday in Brooklyn, where the Nuggets were playing the Nets, he said he had taken care of the gift-giving for his three younger sisters this year. “I made sure they got what they wanted,” he said. But Green added that when he was in college, at Virginia Tech, Christmas shopping for his siblings was hit and miss. Actually, mostly miss. He said that since he started making real money, he has had to edit his list of friends. “I cut a lot of people off,” he said. “Some people who were hitting me up just for tickets, some people were hitting me up for just the wrong things, instead of checking up on how I’m doing. My parents told me I had to do it and not to be afraid to do it. So I did do it.” Early said the “30 for 30” ESPN documentary  “You see guys in your neighborhood who had opportunities, who had chances and who blew it,” Early said. “They couldn’t find that balance; they couldn’t control things that many people who are successful can control.” Early said that even in college, he was able to buy thoughtful Christmas gifts for his mother. “I always considered myself a pretty good saver,” he said. “I got a stipend in college and financial aid, so I always had enough money.” Early’s teammate Travis Wear overcame long odds to make the Knicks’ roster this season as an undrafted rookie. He is signed to a one-year deal for the N.B.A.’s rookie minimum, which this year is just over $500,000. Not big by N.B.A. standards — the average salary in the league this season is just under $4.2 million — but not bad at all by almost any other measurement. “Obviously I’m able to buy everyone a gift now, but it’s not anything crazy,” said Wear, 24, who played at U.C.L.A. “I’ll get everyone something, but not anything extravagant. I live pretty modestly; I think the people close to me and the people I do give gifts for realize that.” There is also the Nets rookie Markel Brown, a second-round pick in this year’s draft out of Oklahoma State. He told me his Christmas list had grown since last year, but not the number of people on the list. Instead, he said, he had increased the number of gifts each person would receive. Over all, the rookies I interviewed, not quite rich but with far more money than they used to have, all seemed to have a decent sense of judgment about how generous they could be. And they always have people like Fisher to give them reminders. Asked what he says to rookies about how to handle the pressures of Christmas and gift-giving, he said he told them this: “You are not Santa Claus. Make sure people understand: Santa Claus is a fictional character, and that’s not who you are. You don’t have a responsibility to provide gifts for the world.”
