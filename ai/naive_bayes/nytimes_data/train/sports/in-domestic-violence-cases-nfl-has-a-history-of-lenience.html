In Domestic Violence Cases, N.F.L. Has a History of Lenience
Commissioner Roger Goodell promised stiff discipline for players, but the league’s response to domestic abuse charges has been inconsistent.
===
On April 10, 2007, after more than 50  Mr. Goodell insisted that he would mete out discipline without waiting for the judicial system. “It is my job — not law enforcement’s job — to protect the National Football League,” he said at the time. But in his role as the N.F.L.’s hard-bitten sheriff, Mr. Goodell appears to have had a major blind spot: domestic violence cases. Players charged with domestic violence routinely received considerably lighter punishments than players accused of other offenses, like drug use or drunken driving. Often, they were not punished at all. On Friday, seven years after he implemented the personal conduct policy, Mr. Goodell acknowledged publicly that it had failed and would be overhauled. “We should have had the personal conduct policy reviewed more frequently, to make the changes necessary to deal with the issues that have changed,” he said at a news conference in which he announced that outside experts would help the league devise a new system for handling domestic violence cases. An examination of dozens of arrests of N.F.L players since Mr. Goodell established his personal conduct policy in 2007 — and the fines and penalties doled out by the league — shows that suspensions of two to four games, and sometimes more, were far more likely for players arrested for drunken driving, marijuana possession or weapon charges. The vast majority of players charged with domestic violence crimes, if they were disciplined by the league at all, received one-game suspensions even after pleading guilty to lesser related charges or entering pretrial intervention programs. The disparity in punishments within the league is illustrated in numerous cases. On Nov. 25, 2011, for example, Green Bay Packers linebacker Erik Walden was arrested on suspicion of assaulting his live-in girlfriend. The charge was reduced to disorderly conduct and then dismissed after Walden agreed to perform 50 hours of community service and receive counseling. The N.F.L. suspended Walden for one game. Less than two months earlier, the police seized two and a half pounds of marijuana sent to the home of Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Jerome Simpson. The league suspended Simpson for three games. “I don’t think the N.F.L. did anything more than give lip service to the notion that they were taking domestic abuse seriously,” said Ann DeLaney, an advocate for victims of domestic violence and the former executive director of the Julian Center in Indianapolis, a victim support group. Referring to the Ray Rice case, Ms. DeLaney continued: “That’s what they did this time until it was caught on video.” Mr. Rice, a Baltimore Ravens running back, was suspended for only two games after being accused of assaulting his fiancée, Janay Palmer, in February; Ms. Palmer is now married to Mr. Rice. After a firestorm of criticism that the punishment was inadequate, Mr. Goodell increased the league’s minimum suspension for a first-time domestic violence offense to six games. After a video surfaced of Mr. Rice knocking out Ms. Palmer in a hotel elevator, Mr. Goodell suspended Mr. Rice indefinitely. Tyrone Thomas, a Washington lawyer who advises on sports cases, said the N.F.L. had always had the power to take a tougher tack in instances in which there were accusations of domestic violence but had chosen not to. Mr. Thomas said that the N.F.L. had treated domestic violence as a “back-burner” concern and that punishing players caught doping or driving under the influence had been a higher priority. “There certainly could have been a harsher interpretation of certain standards,” Mr. Thomas said. In multiple cases since 2007, the N.F.L.’s response to domestic violence arrests appeared arbitrary. Within the first year of the personal conduct policy, the contrast in the handling of different cases was on display when three members of the Pittsburgh Steelers — a running back, Najeh Davenport; linebacker James Harrison; and wide receiver Cedrick Wilson — were accused in domestic violence cases, according to news reports at the time. Mr. Davenport, who was accused during the season, was never suspended and was acquitted after a trial that took place after the season. Mr. Harrison, a star and an important player during the Steelers’ run to the Super Bowl after the 2008 season, also was not suspended. But Mr. Wilson, a lesser-known player, was dropped from the team within hours of his arrest, and he never played in the N.F.L. again. During the last seven years, when a domestic abuse arrest involved a player who was not a starter or a major contributor to the team, the player was sometimes released by his team. In those cases, the league would not have had to consider a suspension. Mr. Harrison’s agent, William Parise, said the league had made the right call with Mr. Harrison. “There was never anything there,” Mr. Parise said. “He did not strike her or do anything like that. He didn’t press charges. She didn’t press charges. And the league dropped the whole thing.” In one of the higher-profile cases, Brandon Marshall, a wide receiver with the Denver Broncos at the time, was initially suspended for three games over events that included his being arrested on charges of assaulting his girlfriend. But his suspension was later reduced to one game. In 2010, Tony McDaniel, a defensive lineman for the Miami Dolphins, was suspended for one game for violating the league’s personal conduct policy after he pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct after a domestic dispute with his live-in girlfriend, according to The Sun-Sentinel newspaper in southern Florida. He was sentenced to probation and ordered to attend counseling. In another case in 2008, Michael Boley, a linebacker with the Atlanta Falcons at the time, was suspended by the league for a game after he was charged with battery. His wife at the time had told police that he “became physical with her.” The case did not go to trial. His lawyer, Randall Kessler, of Atlanta, said it was troubling that Mr. Boley had been punished by the N.F.L. “I was not happy that he was suspended based on an allegation, but I’m glad it ended there,” Mr. Kessler said. Later, the police investigated Mr. Boley on child abuse allegations, which were raised amid a child-custody dispute. The outcome of that investigation is unclear. Nita Chaudhary, a founder of UltraViolet, a women’s rights advocacy group, remained critical of the N.F.L. on Friday despite Goodell’s pledge to revamp the league’s personal conduct policy and penalties. “This press circus did nothing to change Goodell’s long history of inaction on and blatant mishandling of domestic violence in the N.F.L.,” Chaudhary said in a statement. “We call on all of the N.F.L.’s sponsors to take a stand against domestic violence by withdrawing their support for the N.F.L. until Goodell is out of office.”
