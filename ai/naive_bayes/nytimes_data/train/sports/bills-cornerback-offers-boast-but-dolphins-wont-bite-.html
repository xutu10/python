Bills Cornerback Offers Boast, but Dolphins Won’t Bite 
Leodis McKelvin started a war of words when he said that Buffalo would win at Miami in Thursday night’s game.

The  Miami’s players said they were unaware when asked about McKelvin’s comments that he “ain’t going to lose no sleep, man; I’m just going to take myself home, put myself to sleep and get ready to play the Dolphins and beat them, point blank, period.” Wide receiver Mike Wallace cracked a smile on Tuesday and acknowledged that he had heard about the comments. “We’ve got to line up Thursday anyway, man, so whatever you say it is what is,” said Wallace, who leads the Dolphins with 40 receptions for 519 yards and six touchdowns. “We’ll be out there on Thursday night. I ain’t got no time for that. We’re not worried about that, man.” Quarterback Ryan Tannehill, whose Dolphins are 5-4, was aware of what McKelvin said, but he insisted he did not see a need to trade words. Buffalo (5-4) has won four of the past five games between the A.F.C. East rivals, including a 29-10 victory in Week 2. Tannehill said he is tired of losing to the Bills. “We didn’t put it up on the board or anything, but we’re aware of what’s been said,” Tannehill said. BEARS WAIVE HOLMES Holmes signed a one-year deal with Chicago in August after being released by the Jets in March. He had eight receptions for 67 yards. 49ERS’ WILLIS OUT FOR SEASON  A Pro Bowl player all seven seasons in the N.F.L., Willis had missed six games in his career before this latest injury sidelined him for the final 10 games in 2014 for San Francisco (5-4). He had 34 tackles and an interception this season. JETS ROOKIE HAS ‘A CHIP’  Pryor, the team’s first-round draft pick last May, was replaced in last Sunday’s starting lineup by Jaiquawn Jarrett, who had two interceptions, a sack and a fumble recovery in the Jets’ 20-13 win over the Steelers. Pryor played only on special teams. Coach Rex Ryan said Jarrett earned the start because of his efforts in practices and meetings. Pryor acknowledged he was late for meetings, but played it down a bit by adding that “it’s not the first time” it has happened to a player. Several veteran teammates have addressed the issue with Pryor. BRENT BACK WITH COWBOYS  Brent was placed on the 53-man roster Tuesday. The N.F.L. granted his petition for reinstatement before the season but suspended him for 10 games. Coach Jason Garrett has not said when Brent would be ready to play. He said Brent, 26, who has been practicing for two weeks, is overweight. His last game was on Dec. 2, 2012, six days before the crash that killed his teammate Jerry Brown. SEAHAWKS LOSE MEBANE
