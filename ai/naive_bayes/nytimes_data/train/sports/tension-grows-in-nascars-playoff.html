Tension Grows in Nascar’s Playoff 
The Geico 500 on Sunday will winnow the Sprint Cup field down to eight, and some of the sport’s top drivers are facing elimination.

CONCORD, N.C. —  Around the time Kevin Harvick was celebrating his Sprint Cup victory in the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway on Oct. 11, Matt Kenseth was putting Brad Keselowski in a headlock that set off a melee in the garage. As fights go, this was more professional wrestling than the sweet science. Nascar officials fined Keselowski $50,000 Tuesday for using his No. 2 Ford to ram into Kenseth’s No. 20 Toyota on pit road and fined Tony Stewart $25,000 for retaliating after his racecar was struck as well. Both drivers were also put on probation. But the officials did not penalize Kenseth. Maybe they were as shocked about the fight as everyone else. Or grateful. “When you see Matt Kenseth mad enough to fight, you know this is intense because that’s way out of character for him,” Harvick said after the race. All of which makes Nascar’s new playoff format at least a partial success so far. The annual 10-race playoff to determine the Sprint Cup champion was redesigned this year to ratchet up the intensity as well as fan interest and television ratings. Although ratings have been mixed five races into the playoff, the format created plenty of drama at Charlotte and was likely to make the Geico 500 at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama on Sunday must-watch TV for anyone who likes bile, bumper cars and the Big One, as large multicar crashes are known. “When you see that emotion out of Matt Kenseth, you know that Nascar has done the right thing to this Chase because everybody is on offense and gouging for every single position that you can get every lap,” Harvick said. After instituting a 10-race playoff in 2004 with drivers having to accumulate points over that stretch to win the title, Nascar revamped the format this year. An expanded 16-car field competes in three three-race elimination rounds. After each round, four drivers are cut from the field. That leaves one final winner-take-all race among four drivers at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Nov. 16. Talladega is the last race of the second round, with four drivers about to be eliminated and the finalists cut to eight going into next week’s race at Martinsville. And some of the top contenders for the title unexpectedly find themselves on that bubble, including Kenseth, the 2003 winner; the 2012 champion, Keselowski; the six-time champion Jimmie Johnson; and Dale Earnhardt Jr., one of Nascar’s most popular drivers. Kenseth is ninth in points with 3,056, 1 behind Kasey Kahne in eighth. Keselowski is 10th, 18 points behind Kahne, with Johnson and Earnhardt tied and 26 points back of eighth place. Keselowski, Johnson and Earnhardt are so far back they may need to win Sunday to advance. But the enormous Talladega is one of Nascar’s most unpredictable tracks. Restrictor plates limit engine horsepower and keep speeds down. What results is large packs of cars racing closely together at nearly 200 miles an hour, with those multicar crashes that inevitably occur. Talladega is hard enough during the regular season. Add a little desperation and nobody knows what may happen. “My guess is that he will probably try to wreck everyone,” Hamlin said of Keselowski after the Charlotte race. “That’s his only shot. He’ll just be out of control, like normal.” Keselowski, who had little to say about the fine on Friday, brushed off Hamlin’s comments. “It is just a bunch of talk to give you guys something to talk about,” he said. “It worked. It might work with you, but it doesn’t work with me.” More important for Nascar is whether it will work with fans. Ratings were up in the Chase opener at Chicago on Sept. 14 compared with last year’s, which might have been affected by a long rain delay. But ratings were flat in the second race at New Hampshire and have been down at races at Dover, Kansas and Charlotte so far. Talladega will be as good a measure as any of Nascar’s popularity, given all that is on the line Sunday. Only two drivers are locked into the next round: Harvick, who won at Charlotte to earn the automatic berth, and Joey Logano, who did the same at Kansas the week before. Kyle Busch, Ryan Newman, Carl Edwards, Jeff Gordon, Hamlin and Kahne are also in the top eight, although far from secure, with Kenseth, Keselowski, Johnson and Earnhardt pushing to bump them out. “There are at least four that have a really good reason to take chances, be aggressive and try to win,” Johnson said. And there are two drivers, Harvick and Logano, who have nothing to lose, a rarity in the sport. “I won’t be anorexic and throwing up all week,” Harvick said after the win, joking that he would take himself out of the race to avoid the crashes. “I’m parking it and watching. It’s going to be fun to watch. It’s going to be crazy, offensive racing.”
