Looking Like Champions, Rangers Rout a Top Team
The Rangers scored three goals in the first period at the Garden and ended Pittsburgh’s seven-game winning streak.

The  The Penguins were leading the N.H.L. in wins, points, goals per game and most every other offensive category. The Rangers had lost their last two games, including a lackluster performance Sunday against the lowly Edmonton Oilers. But it took only one period to bring out two important points: The Rangers are the defending Eastern Conference champions and are perhaps still the team to beat in the Metropolitan Division. The Rangers skated circles around Pittsburgh in the opening 20 minutes, scoring three times en route to a 5-0 win at Madison Square Garden. Martin St. Louis, Mats Zuccarello and Kevin Klein each had a first-period goal, and Derick Brassard and Rick Nash also scored, as the Rangers won in regulation for only the third time this season, and the first since Oct. 27 against the Minnesota Wild. “We knew what we did wrong in the last couple of games, and we knew we had to correct it,” Nash said, “and we knew we needed to come with a huge effort tonight.” The convincing victory ended the Penguins’ seven-game winning streak and a stretch of 39 consecutive penalties killed, as they were shut out for the first time this season. “They’re a great hockey team,” defenseman Marc Staal said. “I think we’ve played our best hockey when we’ve played against some of those top-tier teams.” In the first period, the Rangers’ best defense was their offense as they registered nine of the first 12 shots. Only Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury held the Rangers at bay. But Fleury — 9-2-0 in his last 11 games, with a 1.90 goals-against average and a .931 save percentage entering the game — could hold off the Rangers for only so long. Zuccarello opened the scoring at 8 minutes 23 seconds when his shot beat Fleury from the top of the left circle. The goal was Zuccarello’s third in 13 games and started a three-goal onslaught in 6:24. “We had to be a lot better prepared in the first 10 minutes than we were,” Penguins Coach Mike Johnston said. “Once we saw the level they were coming out with, we had to respond, and I think it took us way too long to respond.” Fleury, only 7-6-1 with a 2.92 goals-against average and an .891 save percentage in the regular season at the Garden since 2007-8, fell to 26-15-8 against the Rangers. He received derisive cheers from the crowd in the third period when the game got out of hand. Fleury has struggled in the postseason, and just as he was during the Rangers’ seven-game series win in last spring’s conference semifinals, he was outplayed by Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped 33 shots. Fleury was not helped by his team’s defense. Sloppy puck handling led to multiple scoring chances for the Rangers, including their second goal. St. Louis pressured Christian Ehrhoff into a turnover, and Staal took the puck and sent it to Nash. He found St. Louis, who slid the puck into the vacant net, putting the Rangers up, 2-0. Lundqvist said the Rangers knew “that we had to play our absolute best. They have so much skill. I felt the way we set the tone in the first really helped us.” Sidney Crosby, who leads the league in points with 24, was shut out for only the fourth time this season. Crosby finished with more penalty minutes (two) than shots (one) as the Penguins fell to 1-3-0 in games in which he has not registered a point. Pittsburgh’s league-leading power play, converting at a jaw-dropping 37.5 percent entering the game, was limited to six shots in three chances. Even that went awry when Nash scored his league-leading 12th goal midway through the third period, 12 seconds after the Rangers’ Tanner Glass was sent to the box for boarding. It was Nash’s first short-handed goal of the season. “Those are always fun,” he said.
