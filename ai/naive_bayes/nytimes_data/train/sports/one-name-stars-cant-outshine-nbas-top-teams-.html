One-Name Stars Can’t Outshine All-for-One Teams 
Thursday’s games demonstrated that a league long driven by a shoe-company, me-first agenda has continued to lean toward the long-underplayed joy of collective achievement.

Everyone was a one-name star, if not an actual brand-name superstar, on Thursday around the N.B.A. But beyond the obligatory marketing pitch — in this case the donning of jerseys with first names stitched onto their backs — the best Christmas news for the purist fan is that a league long driven by a shoe-company, celebrate-the-individual agenda has continued to lean toward the long-underplayed joy of collective achievement. For this we can thank the  Having escaped the mediocrity that has settled in at his former home in Brooklyn, and while comforting his 37-year-old feet in a bucket of ice in the visitors’ locker room, Pierce ran with a question of why the league seemed to be experiencing a rise of teams not necessarily endowed with players who have earned the one-name treatment from casual fans. Besides the Wizards, now 20-8, you know those teams as Toronto, Atlanta, Golden State and Memphis, in addition to the Spurs, the defending champions, whose regular-season goal appears to be simply getting to the playoffs healthy and rested. “I think San Antonio really created that model,” Pierce said before the Spurs fell to the Oklahoma City Thunder, 114-106. “Usually when a team wins the championship, the next year the teams that are contending try to model themselves after that.” Pierce mentioned the Big 3 mimicry that proliferated after he, Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett blended seamlessly in Boston to win a championship in 2008. “Then Miami did it and other teams — they tried to do it here, too,” he said, referring to the Knicks. Passing on the obvious commentary of how that worked out, Pierce added, “Now that San Antonio won the championship and they’re back on top, more and more you’re seeing teams staying together with a core that try to prepare themselves with deeper benches, and those are the teams that are showing the most success, instead of leaning on one, two or three guys. “You’re seeing deeper teams in this league — you know, more team play,” he continued. “You’re seeing guys who were starters on other teams coming off the bench. You’re not just seeing one guy score all the points.” That obvious dig at Anthony was underscored when the Wizards, with five players contributing at least 8 points but no one recording more than 11, scored 60 in the first half for a 16-point lead. Anthony had 21 points in the half for the bewildered Knicks, but nobody else scored more than 5. Voluntarily tethered to a team he couldn’t have imagined would have the league’s most losses at this point in the season, Anthony has become the leading candidate to be considered the season’s most aggrieved $100 million player. He didn’t re-sign for a steadily improving shot at the No. 1 pick in June’s draft, even if that now represents the best and perhaps only foreseeable hope for a reversal of fortune. The Knicks’ president, Phil Jackson, attended Thursday’s game, but he delivered his holiday cheer over Twitter. “Please be assured your hopes and wishes are getting through to Santa,”  After finishing with 34 points (and 28 field-goal attempts) and being caught on replays jogging back during several Wizards fast breaks, a subdued Anthony said, “2015 is in a couple of days.” Santa will be no savior for 2015, but miserable as Anthony must be, he does have big-name company, beginning with Kobe Bryant, whose career sands are emptying to the bottom of the hourglass in Los Angeles. Five championship rings with the now-also-ran Lakers offer little immunity from the kneejerk blame machine. One cable network conducted a debate on Wednesday about whether the Lakers, who recently stunned the Warriors without Bryant in the lineup, were better off without him. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook can attribute Oklahoma City’s 14-16 record to injuries, but the season has brought little cheer for them. And back in Los Angeles, the Clippers —  Naturally, the Trail Blazers didn’t make the Christmas Day schedule. Familiar storylines are hard to let go. So Bryant, though inactive, was with the Lakers in Chicago, and in Miami, the remains of the Heat foiled LeBron James, the homecoming king, and his Cleveland Cavaliers, a team sitting in fifth in the Eastern Conference, behind Toronto, Atlanta, Washington and Chicago. Now James will have to do without Anderson Varejao, perhaps his favorite teammate and the Cavaliers’ most aggressive interior defender. Instead of using his de facto general manager’s authority to sign his pals Mike Miller and James Jones, James would have been better off making a run over the summer at a rim protector. At least James, like Dwight Howard (Houston) and Derrick Rose (Chicago), plays for a team with a winning record. The other seven best-paid N.B.A. players had a combined record of 51-91 entering Thursday. Four of them happen to play in New York (Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire with the Knicks; Joe Johnson and Deron Williams with the Nets). Seven of the 15 players on the Knicks’ roster weren’t there last season, and fans should hope that a good number of them will not return next season. It’s going to be a while before the Knicks have a competitive core to answer the call. “I do think there’s some advantage to having a group of guys who have worked together just long enough to care about each other so that the other guys’ success means as much to them as their own success does,” Coach Derek Fisher said. “And that only comes from time — you just can’t put guys together and expect them to think that way.” Even on Christmas, and on a first-name basis, it was obvious yet again that these Knicks have no feel or great love for one another. Whatever Jackson promised on Twitter, the stark reality is that his team is nowhere near where the N.B.A. is trending.
