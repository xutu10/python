 Still Awaiting Union Ruling, Athletes Focus on Field 
As Northwestern waits for a decision on an appeal of a ruling that the school’s scholarship players are employees, the football team continues to focus on the game.

EVANSTON, Ill. —  The day Northwestern football players  “I don’t know if it’s changing because of us or something else,” Jimmy Hall, a senior linebacker at Northwestern, said after the Wildcats’ practice Wednesday. “But you get a little pride knowing that we set out with a goal to do something, and it’s starting to get accomplished.” The debate over unionization exposed deep fault lines in the locker room and around campus here. The university and Coach Pat Fitzgerald campaigned to defeat the certification vote, forcing many players to balance their affection for Fitzgerald with a desire to influence the national conversation about college sports. The union discussions have since subsided, publicly and privately, players say, while the National Labor Relations Board in Washington considers Northwestern’s appeal of a ruling by a regional director of the agency that said that scholarship players were university employees. A lawyer for the players is hopeful for a decision in the coming weeks, but as they have done all summer and fall, the players intend to keep their focus on football. “If you were in our locker room for the entire week, you wouldn’t hear the word union,” said Brandon Vitabile, a senior offensive lineman. “I’m proud that we were able to move past our different opinions and come together for the season. We’re trying to win a game every week.” Northwestern players remain unsure of their roles in the current soul-searching climate of college sports. There had been plans for changes within the N.C.A.A., and lawsuits have exerted their own pressures on the system. Ramogi Huma, the president of the College Athletes Players Association, said he believed the Northwestern players had lit the powder keg. “It’s the most empowering action in the history of college sports,” Huma said. “And it’s led to immediate change.” It began on a subzero January morning in Chicago when Kain Colter, who was Northwestern’s quarterback last season, flanked by members of the United Steelworkers, announced that the team had filed a union petition. He spoke of long-term health care, the long hours he had spent playing football and how athletes needed a seat at the table. In recent months, the Big Ten and the Pacific-12 have guaranteed four-year scholarships (Northwestern has guaranteed them since 2011). The Pac-12 will provide medical coverage for four years after a player leaves college. In January, the N.C.A.A. — under a new structure that includes increased participation from athletes — is expected to increase the value of a scholarship by several thousand dollars. Congress has pressed for change, too. After a speech touting his overhaul agenda last month, Mark Emmert, the N.C.A.A.’s president, said: “When you stop and look at the list of issues the Northwestern football team was interested in, they’re pretty consistent with what I just said.” Fitzgerald, who testified against the formation of a union during a tense four-day N.L.R.B. hearing, said this week: “Our guys, from a standpoint of trying to help other folks out, I’m really proud of them. But from what we do here and how we’ve done things, it’s always been first-class.” On the field, Northwestern has endured an up-and-down season. Stirring upsets of Notre Dame and Wisconsin were countered by losses to Northern Illinois and Michigan. With a 5-6 record, the Wildcats need a win against their in-state rival Illinois on Saturday to earn a bowl invitation. Still, a return to the legal spotlight may loom with the term of one N.L.R.B. member, Nancy Schiffer, scheduled to end Dec. 16. A flurry of decisions often accompanies the end of a term, and election cases are usually given higher priority. “I sure would like to know the ruling,” said John Adam, a lawyer for the College Athletes Players Association, noting that if the decision is delayed it may have to wait until after the Senate has confirmed Schiffer’s replacement. Adam said that if the five-member board upheld the decision finding that the players are employees, he expects the ballots to be counted within a week or two. If a majority of the ballots cast favor a union (76 players were eligible), the university could begin the collective bargaining process or appeal to federal court. Even if the union vote fails at Northwestern, the precedent set by the board will remain and could make the path to unionization at other universities easier. (Northwestern players would be eligible to vote again in April.) If the board overturns the regional ruling, the votes will not be counted. Whenever the ruling comes down, Vitabile said he was confident that the vote would favor the university. “For everything we get and the way we’re treated, I don’t think the votes will go through,” he said. Vitabile said he recognized the impact of what he and his teammates had done. “I think it’s cool for college sports that things are changing,” he said. “Maybe someone had to rock the boat a little bit.”
