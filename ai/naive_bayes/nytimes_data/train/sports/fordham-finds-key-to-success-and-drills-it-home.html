Fordham Finds Key to Success, and Drills It Home
The ninth-ranked Rams take a 10-2 record and hopes for a championship run into their playoff opener against No. 25 Sacred Heart on Saturday.

When Joe Moorhead took over the football program at Fordham, after it struck bottom with a 1-10 record in 2011, the technical aspects of the sport were secondary to his emphasis on discipline, work ethic and attention to detail. Relying on players from that one-win team, Moorhead built Fordham into a Football Championship Subdivision power. “Our job as coaches is to create a culture of success,” Moorhead said. The ninth-ranked Rams, who finished atop the Patriot League for the first time since 2007, take a 10-2 record and hopes for a championship run into their playoff opener against No. 25 Sacred Heart on Saturday at Jack Coffey Field in the Bronx. “I’m proud of what Fordham football has become,” said tight end Dan Light, one of 17 senior starters who overcame that awful beginning in 2011. “Obviously, our goal is a national championship, and we’re not going to shy away from our goal. We never have. That is our expectation. We are not going to feel pressure. We are going to apply pressure.” Fordham defeated Sacred Heart, 37-27, last year for its first home playoff victory and set a team record for victories with an eventual 12-2 record. Last season ended with a second-round loss at Towson, 48-28, after the score was tied at halftime. Quarterback Mike Nebrich said the memories from that defeat should help the Rams this postseason. “We know what it takes, we know exactly what we need to do, and we know we have the components to do it,” said Nebrich, who repeated as the Patriot League offensive player of the year in throwing for 3,015 yards and 25 touchdowns, despite missing two games with appendicitis. The confidence expressed by Light, Nebrich and other members of a team that includes 32 seniors reflects how successfully Moorhead and his staff instilled a new culture among players once desperate for answers. “The team bought in from Day 1,” said Light, one of the team’s captains. “We were going to do whatever it took to get it right. If you told us we had to run through a wall, we were going to run through a wall.” Moorhead did not ask them to attempt that. But sometimes it felt that way. One of the first drills he oversaw as part of off-season conditioning that began at 6 a.m. was called Perfect 10. Players were required to sprint approximately 25 yards in an exacting fashion. They could take off only on the coach’s whistle, not on verbal commands, intended to test their discipline. Anyone who touched short of the end line — or on the end line — was required to repeat the effort until all 10 sprints were done correctly. “When I say touch the line,” Moorhead said, “I mean past the line.” The first few days the Rams were asked to run Perfect 10s, they were anything but. Countless sprints needed to be repeated. Exhaustion set in; dissent did not. “When someone is that demanding of you coming off a bad season, you could easily kick it in,” Light said. “That was a point where we all came together and said, ‘We’re going to get this thing fixed,’ and that’s a credit to my teammates.” Perfect sprints ultimately led to quality practices, which led to significant improvement to a 6-5 record in Moorhead’s first year. His continued emphasis on preparation resulted in even greater gains, not to mention a growing collection of motivational tools. A tree stump, an ax and a pickax can be found on the Fordham side. The tree stump and the ax, which players use to slice into the stump before games, remind them of an Abraham Lincoln reference Moorhead often makes. In his emphasis on preparedness, Lincoln said if he was given a specified number of hours to chop down a tree, he would spend a vast majority of his time sharpening his ax. And the pickax? That refers to a gold prospector who sold a parcel of land after he failed in his search for the precious metal. The purchaser dug three more feet — and struck gold. For players who once sought motivation, Moorhead, a quarterback at Fordham from 1992 to 1995, offers it in abundance. “He’s the definition of a players’ coach,” Nebrich said. “He really knows how to connect to the guys around him.” Moorhead served as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Connecticut before he accepted the position at Fordham. Nebrich so valued his relationship with Moorhead that he transferred to Fordham from Connecticut. “He’s kind of a second dad to me at this point,” said Nebrich, a senior whose addition turned the Rams’ offense into an explosive unit. With Chase Edmonds, a freshman running back, rushing for 1,539 yards and a team-record 21 touchdowns, the Rams have scored 40 or more points in 9 of 12 games this year. Fifteen Fordham players were named to the all-Patriot League first team, a league record. Moorhead received a contract extension through 2021 at the end of 2013. He emphasizes that the players are responsible for righting the program and taking it to great heights. “We set the ship on its course, and it’s their responsibility to make sure it’s going in the right direction,” he said. “Hopefully, we can go all the way. That’s the one goal we haven’t accomplished.” No matter how this season ends, Fordham’s seniors know how much they have grown from adversity. Their legacy is secure.
