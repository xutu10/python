After a two and a half hour hearing on Wednesday, District Judge Bernard M. Jones II of Oklahoma City said he would issue a ruling Thursday morning on whether part or all of a disputed high school football playoff game should be replayed. The case involves a Class 3A quarterfinal on Nov. 28 between rural Locust Grove High School and Frederick Douglass High of Oklahoma City. Douglass scored on a 58-yard touchdown pass with 64 seconds left to take an apparent 20-19 lead. But the referees wrongly nullified the touchdown after penalizing Douglass for a dead-ball sideline infraction. The Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association called the refereeing error inexcusable but said its bylaws prohibited the protesting of the officials’ ruling.
