Williams and Sharapova, Still Foes After All These Years
The world's top two women's players are heading into the year-end finals in Singapore with the No.1 ranking on the line.

After the intermittent sniping of 2013, it has been a peaceful year in public for  But as the women’s tennis season comes to its end-of-season boil for the first time in Singapore, there has been no change in the essential: Sharapova, despite a resurgent campaign, still has not beaten Williams since 2004. That remains rather hard to fathom, knowing the work ethic and inner rage that animate Sharapova’s game, as well as her ability to answer power with power. But Williams has saved her lapses for lesser threats over the last decade, and though Sharapova had two more cracks at changing her luck in 2014 — the semifinals in Brisbane in January and the semifinals in Miami in March — she could not win a set on either occasion, extending her losing streak in their ongoing series to 15 matches. It became clear long ago that this would go down as the Serena era, not the Maria era. And yet this will certainly not go down as Williams’s finest season, even though she won her 18th Grand Slam singles title at the  “As Maria has said, it’s not a rivalry until she beats her,” said Tracy Austin, the former world No.1 who will be in Singapore as a television analyst and a participant in the new legends event. “It’s been a decade, but I’d still have to say if there’s one match I’d pick to watch, it’s that one. They have played closer a couple of times lately, but Serena has the edge, and what makes the difference at the end of the day is the edge in athleticism.” They cannot meet in Singapore until at least the semifinals of the W.T.A. Finals, which begin with a round-robin phase. The top-ranked Williams and the second-ranked Sharapova are in different four-woman groups, and it is unclear whether Williams is even fit enough to defend the title she won in 2012 and 2013. Her left knee, long a trouble spot, acted up again in Beijing, where she withdrew before her quarterfinal against Samantha Stosur earlier this month. “If I feel this way for Singapore, I don’t think it’s smart for me to play,” Williams said in Beijing. She sought treatment in Paris and resumed training. There is much to play for in Singapore, including a tournament record of $6.5 million in prize money. She has been unable to play the finals on four occasions because of injury, withdrawing after qualifying in 1999, 2000, 2003 and 2010. She also has had to withdraw with injuries mid-tournament in 2007 and 2008. It seems wise to watch her play a round-robin match or two before pronouncing her the favorite, even if she is 49-4 against the rest of the field. It seems wise, too, for the first alternate, Angelique Kerber, to remain prepared. “It has been a strange season, I think,” said Wim Fissette, the coach of Simona Halep. “Of course a player like Serena is really focusing on only the big tournaments. You feel that. You see that, and I think also physically it’s not possible for her to be there at the top the whole year. Yes, she won her Grand Slam, but the other Grand Slams were disappointing for her. Still, I see her as the favorite for the finals.” For the first time since 1977, there were eight different finalists in the Grand Slam events, with Li Na beating Dominika Cibulkova to win the Australian Open; Sharapova beating Halep to win the  Williams, Sharapova, Kvitova, Halep, Bouchard, Wozniacki, Agnieszka Radwanska and Ana Ivanovic are the eight who made it to Singapore. Li, the 32-year-old Chinese star, would have qualified but retired last month because of major knee problems of her own. Williams, at 33 the only player in the Singapore singles lineup over 30, marches on, searching to recapture her consistent dominance and focus of 2013. “It’s difficult to understand,” her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, said in New York of Williams’s hot-and-cold season in 2014. “The only explanation we have is that after the year and a half she spent winning so much and playing so much, she had a moment where she dropped a bit in terms of her nerves and her mental game and then lost matches. In the losing matches, she lost a bit of confidence.” There was also her mysterious performance at Wimbledon, where after losing early in singles, she staggered around the grass during a doubles match with her sister Venus, cried during an on-court medical exam and eventually retired after three deeply troubling games. She attributed her disorientation to a virus, though Mouratoglou later said in an interview with a French tennis magazine that “there were complicated things and it is true that Serena is in a difficult phase, but I’ll leave it there.” Asked for clarification in New York, Mouratoglou shrugged and answered, “I said what I could say.” Her strong end-of-summer run was impressive, all the more so after the Wimbledon meltdown, but the autumn has been less reassuring. If Williams does play in Singapore, she can secure the No.1 ranking by reaching the final undefeated, no matter what Sharapova does. Sharapova has to win at least two of her three round-robin matches to have any chance at No.1. However Sharapova fares. she has rebounded impressively from her latest round of serious shoulder problems that spoiled the end of her 2013 season. With a new team behind her led by her coach, Sven Groeneveld, she is 48-11 in 2014 with four titles. Despite all the millions, despite all the potential distractions and self-satisfactions, she remains a driven, scrappy superstar. But for now, solving the Williams riddle remains beyond her.
