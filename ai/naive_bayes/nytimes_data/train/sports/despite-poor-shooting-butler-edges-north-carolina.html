Alex Barlow and Kelan Martin each scored 17 points for Butler, and the Bulldogs grabbed 29 offensive rebounds to defeat No. 5 North Carolina, 74-66, in the opening game of the Battle 4 Atlantis on Wednesday in the Bahamas. The Bulldogs shot 31 percent from the field, and just 7 percent in the final eight minutes. Kameron Woods had 13 rebounds and Roosevelt Jones scored 12 points for Butler (4-0), which defeated North Carolina for the second straight time. The Bulldogs beat the Tar Heels at the Maui Invitational in 2012. Butler went on a 16-4 run over a five-and-a-half-minute stretch in the second half, turning a 43-41 lead into a 59-45 cushion. Marcus Paige shook off a slow start and scored 18 points for North Carolina (3-1), and Brice Johnson added 11. OKLAHOMA 75, U.C.L.A. 65 Frank Booker added 11 points and Jordan Woodard had 10 for the Sooners (3-1), who shot 33 percent from the field. Half of the eight-team field in the Bahamas entered the tournament ranked in the Associated Press Top 25 poll, but Oklahoma’s win ensured that an unranked team would play in Friday’s title game. Butler will play Oklahoma in Thursday’s semifinals, and U.C.L.A. will face North Carolina in the consolation round. WISCONSIN 72, U.A.B. 43 Josh Gasser added 10 points to help the Badgers (5-0) win their 21st straight regular-season nonconference game. Wisconsin held U.A.B. to 35 percent shooting, and has given up just 46.6 points a game this season. DUKE 93, FURMAN 54 Amile Jefferson added 16 points and 12 rebounds for the No. 4 Blue Devils (6-0). They had little trouble remaining unbeaten, shooting 58 percent and holding the Paladins to 34 percent from the field. Kendrec Ferrara had 13 points and Stephen Croone added 12 for Furman (1-3). LOUISVILLE 45, CLEVE. STATE 33 Chris Jones added 11 points, and the freshman Chinanu Onuaku blocked seven shots for the Cardinals (5-0). OHIO STATE 91, CAMPBELL 64 D’Angelo Russell led the Buckeyes (4-0) with 22 points, and Shannon Scott and Sam Thompson each had 11. WEST VIRGINIA 103, V.M.I. 72 West Virginia (6-0) is off to its best start since it went 11-0 to begin the 2009-10 season, when it reached the Final Four. It marked the highest-scoring game for the Mountaineers since a 110-44 win over Maryland Eastern Shore in 2007. Women CHATTANOOGA 67, TENNESSEE 63 The score was tied at 63-63 in the final minute when Tennessee’s Andraya Carter stole the ball at midcourt and drove to the basket, but Gilbert blocked the shot and Chattanooga recovered the ball. WEST VIRGINIA 83, EVANSVILLE 39 GEORGIA 66, COLGATE 35
