Giants and Tom Coughlin Near a Crossroads
The Giants’ 3-7 record has raised questions about the job security of Coach Tom Coughlin and General Manager Jerry Reese.
===
During an August interview a week before the Giants’ opening game, one of the team’s owners, John Mara, spent nearly an hour analyzing the changes that had been made to the roster in the off-season. A sweeping transformation had been necessary, Mara said, because the 2013 season was one of the most disappointing he could remember. With the opener just days away, Mara was still wondering if the overhaul had been thorough enough. But when the conversation turned to Coach  “That’s the one thing I don’t worry about at all,” Mara said. “This coach has the pulse of this team, and they do respond to him. I watch practice almost every day, and I’m in the locker room after games, and you see that. I’ve been in other situations that it becomes obvious that they’ve tuned the coach out, and I’ve never seen that since 2004 — never since Tom has been here.” Mara was speaking before the 2014 Giants, in what may be a budding collapse, saw a promising start to the season dissolve in five successive losses. With a 3-7 record heading into Sunday night’s game against the visiting Dallas Cowboys, the Giants are nearly certain to miss the postseason for the third consecutive year. Mara does not comment on the future of coaches in the middle of a season. Nor does he give votes of confidence. It is unclear what he is thinking now about Coughlin’s future. But with Coughlin’s job security once again a hot topic, it is interesting to note the mind-set of Mara, the Giants’ ultimate decision maker, just three months ago. And for fans who absolve Coughlin of the losing and blame General Manager Jerry Reese for not stocking the Giants’ roster with enough talent, this is what Mara had to say about Reese in the same interview: “To me, Jerry is as good a general manager as there is in the league. When it comes to the leadership of the team, I’m confident I have the right people in place.” Increasingly, the question is whether Mara’s confidence has been shaken not only by the seven losses but also by the knowledge that three have been by more than 20 points and three others by 10 or more. Is Mara rethinking his unwavering support of Coughlin, who is 68 and will soon enter the last year of his contract? Does it unnerve Mara that the Giants seem to play their worst at the most crucial times? In the fourth quarters of their losses, the Giants have been outscored by 70-28. And what if a bad streak by the Giants becomes a free fall? What if they struggle to win five games? Outside the Giants’ headquarters and practice complex, the voices calling for Coughlin’s firing are mounting. In Las Vegas, the betting odds give him less than a 50 percent chance of keeping his job. But the Giants have traditionally been impermeable to public opinion when it comes to coaching or administrative hirings and firings. Inside the headquarters, a generally quiet and staid place, the leadership is aware of what is being said and written, but those things do not appear to affect the choices made. Giants executives even seem proud of their independence. There are the things that happen “inside our building,” they say, and then there are the things that happen “outside our building.” The two are sometimes treated as separate universes. It is hard for things outside the building to register significant impact. Except, perhaps, a long, depressing string of losses. Inside the locker room, support for Coughlin has remained stout. “He’s our guy,” safety Antrel Rolle said. “He’s getting us prepared no different than in the winning seasons.” Quarterback Eli Manning agreed. “Coach’s preparation is good,” Manning said. “The game plans are good. The players’ execution is sometimes lacking.” And by any measure, the Giants are still playing hard, just not efficiently. Historically, it is not Giants-like to make a change for its own sake. And they like to stay within the organization. Remember, this is a franchise that has had three general managers in the last 35 years, and the last two were promoted internally. Coughlin had been a Giants assistant more than a decade before he was made the head coach. But the organization has no obvious coaching heir apparent. Certainly, a credible, worthy outside candidate could be found, but that assumes that in the space of three months, Mara has seen Coughlin lose his grip on his team. Is Mara seeing different things after games now? Is this coach no longer in tune with his players? The answer will most likely reveal itself in the six remaining games. From Mara on down, praise was heaped on Coughlin for getting last year’s team to win seven of its last 10 games after an 0-6 start. If the reverse happens this year — a decent start followed by a numbing, embarrassing flop — it will be hard for the Giants to reassure fans unless the next off-season changes involve not only the roster but also the highest levels of the coaching staff. But if the Giants manage to finish respectably, especially if they have a couple of uplifting upsets, the coaching staff could escape an overhaul. The Giants’ management style is to assess, evaluate and make choices from within — not by heeding outside opinions. And we know where the ownership and management stood in August. Is Coughlin’s job in jeopardy? There will be six games to find out. Which brings to mind the midseason comments of Reese, who will probably have a say in Coughlin’s future. In late October, Reese was asked how he saw Coughlin handling the second half of the season. “We’ll see,” Reese said. “One thing I’ll never do, I’ll never bet against Tom Coughlin. When his back is against the wall the most, that’s when he seems to come out swinging and get his football team ready to go.” Reese paused, as if considering precisely what he wanted to say next. “This is a big moment for all of us,” he said.
