N.B.A. Pounds Pavement at Marathon to Promote Fitness, and Itself
More than 20 league executives and former players ran a relay along the marathon route, in part to connect with the city in preparation for the All-Star Game in February.

N.B.A. After passing a baton to the former N.B.A. great Chris Mullin on Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, Silver was met by three young men who had copies of Sports Illustrated with his picture on the cover. His breathing still heavy, Silver signed the magazines and posed for a photo with a Brazilian fan. That fans sought Silver’s autograph on an obscure corner in Brooklyn was another reminder of how he has become the fresh face of the N.B.A. and a new breed of sports commissioner. Silver, who succeeded David Stern less than a year ago, has made a quick and largely positive impression, starting with his handling of the release of recordings of the former Clippers owner Donald Sterling making racist comments. Despite his authoritative control of the crisis, Silver exudes empathy and seems eager to blend in as best he can. That included running the first leg of a relay that was held in parallel to the  The event, which included two dozen executives and former pro basketball players, was designed to promote fitness and the N.B.A. All-Star Game at Barclays Center, scheduled for February. Silver felt the need to get in front of it, even if it meant waking up before dawn to travel to the start in Staten Island. “I think for us it’s important because we know we’re going to be judged accordingly by more than what we do as a business or what we do on the court — the greater impact we have,” said Silver, who ran cross-country and track in high school and has twice finished the New York City Marathon. Silver said he hoped that a season-long string of clinics, workshops and other events like the marathon relay would enable the N.B.A. to reach half a million children in the five boroughs. Silver and the other 23 N.B.A. executives and former players were joined on the relay by young runners. Silver’s partner was Lauren Pitaressi, a high school runner from Staten Island. “My dream is to run the marathon, but I never thought I’d already run over the bridge,” said Pitaressi, who admitted to not knowing who Silver was until recently. The relay within a race was not designed to sell basketball tickets, but the N.B.A. donated $26,200 ($1,000 for each mile) to  Dallas Branch, who teaches sports management at West Virginia University and publishes Sports Marketing Quarterly, commended Silver for taking part but wondered whether the N.B.A. could have been more generous. “I applaud him, for him to step out and be the lead on it,” Branch said, but added, “you would think they would generate $260,000 or $2.6 million.” The N.B.A. is not the only professional sports league to promote health and fitness. Commissioners routinely appear at schools, athletic events and elsewhere. Few, though, lace up their shoes and take part in events themselves. “This is highly unique to be this visible, but actions speak louder than words,” said Bill Sutton, who worked in team marketing at the N.B.A. and now teaches sports business at the University of South Florida. “Everything you do is the portrayal of your brand.” Plans for the relay began this spring, when Chris Weiller, a spokesman for the Road Runners who previously worked at the N.B.A., met Kathy Behrens, the league’s executive vice president for social responsibility. Before every All-Star Game, the N.B.A., like other professional leagues, tries to connect with the host community by sending current and former players to schools, raising money for local charities and building athletic facilities. The marathon racecourse, which touches every borough, was a good vehicle for connecting the N.B.A. with the city, Silver said. But there were logistical hurdles. First, the league had to find two dozen members of the N.B.A. family who were willing to run the streets on a chilly Sunday. “There was great enthusiasm, especially when they found out they wouldn’t have to run 26 miles,” Behrens said. The roster of volunteers included former N.B.A. stars who grew up in New York, including Nate Archibald (a Bronx native known as Tiny), Albert and Bernard King and Mullin (Brooklyn), and former Knicks and Nets players like Greg Anthony, Jason Collins, Darryl Dawkins, Allan Houston and Charles Oakley. Swin Cash and Teresa Edwards were among those representing the W.N.B.A., while Mike Breen, the Knicks’ announcer, joined executives from the N.B.A., Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center. “We’re always trying to think of how to run our race in other environments,” said Mary Wittenberg, the chief executive of New York Road Runners. “This is a first ever, but already it has the feel of something we’ll carry on.”
