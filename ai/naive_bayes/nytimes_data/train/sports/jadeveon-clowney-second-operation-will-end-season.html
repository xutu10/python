Jadeveon Clowney Will Have Second Knee Operation, Ending Season
Clowney, the top overall pick in the N.F.L. draft, was injured in Week 1 and never completely recovered from the procedure.

DeMarco Murray ran for a season-high 179 yards and a touchdown, and Tony Romo threw for three touchdowns as Dallas beat host Chicago, 41-28, on Thursday. The Cowboys (9-4) made it look easy for most of the night against a struggling team that lost star receiver Brandon Marshall to a rib injury. Dallas clinched its first winning season since 2009, but is looking for an N.F.C. East title and its first playoff appearance in five years. Led by Romo and Murray, Dallas rebounded from a blowout loss to the Eagles on Thanksgiving and pulled within a half-game of them, with a showdown in Philadelphia next week. The Cowboys took a 14-7 lead before halftime and scored 21 unanswered points in the third quarter before the Bears (5-8) rallied in the fourth. CLOWNEY’S SEASON OVER  Clowney visited Dr. James Andrews in Pensacola, Fla., on Wednesday to have his right knee examined, and Coach Bill O’Brien announced the news Thursday. Clowney, an outside linebacker, was injured in Week 1 and had arthroscopic surgery Sept. 8. He has played three games since then but has never completely recovered from the procedure and said last week that he was still in pain. O’Brien would not address specifics of Clowney’s surgery.
