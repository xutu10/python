Cricket Contract Dispute in India Forces Schedule Change

India’s millions of television-watching cricket fans will get their fix of top-class action this weekend, just not the match that was originally scheduled. India will play Sri Lanka in a one-day international in Cuttack in eastern India on Sunday, a day when it should have been engaged in a five-day test match against the West Indies. The schedule change is the result of events that could threaten the future of top-class cricket in the West Indies, once the game’s superpower. Two weeks ago, the West Indies players, led by Dwayne Bravo, the captain for one-day international matches, pulled out of their tour of India in protest at their contracts. Bravo said that the players’ match fees had been cut by 75 percent compared with their previous deal and called for the old contract to be restored. The charge was denied by Wavell Hinds, president of the West Indies Players Association, who negotiated the new contract. It was the latest in a long series of disagreements over money and contracts, leading to events like the 1998 tour of South Africa going ahead only after difficult negotiations at Heathrow Airport in London, and replacement teams touring Sri Lanka in 2005 and facing Bangladesh in 2009. The difficulties reflect the West Indies’ endemic handicap as a group of mostly poor islands whose opponents are usually bigger and richer. The West Indian Cricket Board is perpetually cash-strapped and players are underpaid compared with those from other countries. The withdrawal from the India matches, which came midway through a tour — with a series of one-day international matches already played (and lost, 2-1) — raised the stakes. It left India, cricket’s economic and political giant, feeling let down, angry and with a gap in its expected television revenue. The Board of Control for Cricket in India has yet to decide whether it will pursue a claim for loss of earnings, which the ESPN Cricinfocq website estimates could reach $65 million — a huge sum that the impoverished West Indies Cricket Board is unlikely to be able to afford. But India’s cricket board has already struck back, hitting the West Indies where it hurts most — the pocketbook. Aware that tours against India are cricket’s great money-maker, the board has canceled five upcoming meetings scheduled over the next eight years. Four of these series were to be played in the West Indies, the next in 2016. While India’s displeasure threatens West Indian prospects, the West Indies Cricket Board has more pressing matters to resolve. Its team is scheduled to tour South Africa in December and January, then take part in the World Cup, which will be played in Australia and New Zealand in February and March. The West Indies Cricket Board has assured South Africa that the tour will happen, but will struggle to send a credible team unless the dispute can be resolved. A World Cup without West Indies might seem unthinkable; then again, so did a team baling on a tour of India. The problem is that this is no simple dispute between the West Indian players and the authorities. Rather, it’s a three-way disagreement. The players’ anger is directed as much at their representatives in the players association as at the board. Bravo has claimed that Hinds “hoodwinked” the international players over the new contract, hailed only last month as promising stability after the years of disputes. The three parties met in Kingston, Jamaica, last weekend. A joint statement said that “the meeting was cordial, positive and fruitful, and discussions will continue in an effort to find a way forward following the premature end to the tour of India.” It all adds up “to a lose-lose situation,” said Tony Cozier, a veteran West Indian broadcaster. The losers include the wider game of cricket, which certainly cannot afford to lose one of the most storied and passionate of its 10 test-playing nations. Yet cricket’s ruling body, the International Cricket Council, has so far kept its distance, arguing that tours are bilateral matters between the countries involved. Its executive committee will discuss the issue at its Nov. 10 meeting in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. “I don’t believe they will be lost, I can’t imagine that,” Wally Edwards, the Australian chairman of the International Cricket Council’s executive committee, told ESPN Cricinfo. “They’ve had disputes before, they’ve had ongoing rumblings there for quite a while, and I feel confident they will get resolved and West Indies will stay a very important part of world cricket.” Ralph Gonsalves, the prime minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, has written to Dave Cameron, president of the West Indies Cricket Board, suggesting mediation by a three-person panel of current and former prime ministers representing Caricom, an organization of 15 Caribbean nations and dependencies. He also proposed that the panel look beyond the current crisis to the longer-term problems of West Indian cricket. “I do not think that this huge complicated issue can be handled in an ad hoc manner or by the W.I.C.B. alone,” he said in a letter that he read aloud on a radio show in Barbados last week. “This is an extraordinary enterprise, which takes us beyond the boundary.” That governments want to be involved reflects how much cricket continues to matter in the West Indies, but is also demonstrates the extent of the current crisis.
