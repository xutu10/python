Living Out a Knicks Dream, With Nightmares
Dennis Doyle has decided to combine his passions for writing, traveling and the Knicks by attending all of the team’s 82 games this season. But what about all the losing?
===
Dennis Doyle knows how strange it must sound, his giving up his career as a lawyer to hit the road with his favorite sports team. And then his story gets even more unusual. The part about his favorite team being the  “I knew there was a chance that this could be a really awful season,” Doyle, 31, said Thursday at his apartment in Queens. “I asked for it, I guess.” Ten games into the season, Doyle has already made more trips than two injured players, Jose Calderon and Andrea Bargnani. He bumped into Charles Oakley, his favorite former player, at a craps table in Cleveland. He stayed at an urban farm in Detroit. He has watched the Knicks lose eight times (and counting). And he has found his adventure to be a largely solitary one. “It’s actually been hard to talk friends into coming to these games,” Doyle said. But for all the novelty of his season-long experiment, Doyle sees real value in it — a quest for self-discovery, he said, and a chance to explore his passion for writing. He has been chronicling his travels in a  “I think there’s a metaphor between what’s happening with the team and what’s happening in my own life,” Doyle said. “You’ve got this team that’s coming off a horrible year where everything went wrong. But they’re in transition, and there’s hope on the horizon.” His parents have been supportive, he said, although his father, who is also a lawyer, continues to send job listings from legal journals. As for his friends? “Oh, I think it’s the coolest thing ever,” said Jack Colombini, 31, who grew up with Doyle in Katonah, N.Y. “My wife thinks he’s crazy.” Doyle, who graduated from Georgetown’s law school in 2010, hears that a lot. He was, until recently, working in commercial litigation for a small law firm in Manhattan, even though he knew from the start that it was not his ideal profession. His firm represented co-op boards and condominium associations, and Doyle said that part of his job involved sending legal notices to tenants who were late with their bills. It was not much fun, he said. He also recalled an episode with a hot dog vendor who had stationed his cart too close to the entrance of a residential building. After hearing from Doyle’s firm, the vendor wheeled his business a few feet away to comply with city code. “So mission accomplished,” Doyle said, “except that he had moved it to an even worse spot, at least from the building’s perspective.” Doyle wound up spending many hours at the New York City Department of Transportation trying to unearth a solution. One possibility was planting trees in the middle of the sidewalk. Another was suing the vendor “for nuisance.” Eventually, a resident asked the vendor to return to his original spot. So he did. Doyle said he had a hard time disguising his apathy for the work. On March 9, he learned that he was being let go. It was bittersweet, he said. Although he was liberated from doing something he did not want to be doing, he said, he also felt embarrassed. And what was he going to do with his life? It began a new journey, even if the destination was unclear. Having always taken the safe route (law school, stable job), Doyle hoped to try something different. Kelley Doyle Snyder, one of his older sisters, wanted to know what really interested him. Doyle came up with three things: writing, traveling and the Knicks. “There have been times when I would have loved to have been rid of the Knicks,” Doyle said. “For the better part of the last 15 years, I’d say.” Yet his devotion to the team has been unshakable. Consider that he endorsed the Antonio McDyess trade, which turned out to be one of the worst deals in franchise history. He also once ripped the head off a life-size cardboard cutout of Michael Jordan during a playoff game. “That cardboard cutout had it coming,” Doyle said. So one night, in the wake of losing his job, the idea came to him: Why not combine all three of his interests by spending six months with the Knicks? Was the plan outlandish? Yes. Expensive? Absolutely. But several people close to Doyle found it inspiring. “It’s the kind of thing that a lot of people might dream about, but never actually do,” Doyle Snyder said. “That’s what I love about this.” Doyle Snyder, 43, who works as a life coach, said her brother was “living daringly.” Few Knicks fans (if any) have chosen to express their existential crises by committing to attend 82 straight games. During a rebuilding season. And paying for it, in more ways than one. “I could kind of understand if someone had wanted to follow LeBron around in Miami for a year,” Doyle said. “That sounds kind of nice, actually.” The Knicks, on the other hand — well, Doyle has prepared himself for a long season. The wins and losses are largely irrelevant, or at least that is what he tells himself. “This isn’t just about trying to follow around a good team in order to have a good time,” he said. “It’s more of a way to immerse myself in something I’ve felt passionate about for a long time — a feeling I never got too much when I was working in my old job.” Colombini, his childhood friend, described Doyle’s approach to life as one of “controlled adventurism.” “He’s not going to bungee-jump off a cliff,” Colombini said. “He’s not going to go sky diving any time soon. But he wants to see everything. If he goes to a museum, he’s going to look at every stupid picture in the entire place.” Doyle, who is single, has been meticulous in his planning. He has spent $8,000 on airfare for the team’s road trips. He shelled out $3,500 for season tickets to home games at Madison Square Garden (Section 220) and another $4,000 for tickets to away games. Doyle said the Knicks’ coming trip to London for a game in January was a bit of a budget buster — he found a round-trip flight for $700 — but hopes to make the most of his week in Britain. “I’d like to visit Stonehenge,” he said. He has also made sure to spiff up the appearance of his blog. “I didn’t want it to look like the typical blog where I was writing it in my mom’s basement,” he said. At the Garden, Doyle has befriended some of his fellow season-ticket holders. Mostly, though, he looks forward to going on the road and seeing the country. “Even if it’s a terrible season, I’m still going to be able to visit all these different cities,” Doyle said. “I refuse to let the Knicks ruin that.”
