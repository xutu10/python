LeBron James Says Owners Can’t Line Their Pockets Now and Cry Poverty Later
With the N.B.A. announcing $24 billion worth of television contract deals, James threw down the gauntlet on future collective bargaining negotiations.

INDEPENDENCE, Ohio — On a day when the  At the Cleveland Cavaliers’ practice facility,  “The whole thing that went on with the negotiation process was that the owners were telling us that they were losing money,” James said. “There is no way they can sit in front of us and tell us that right now.” Not after television revenues were tripled with the nine-year agreements that will begin after next season. Not after, as James said, “you continue to see teams sold for hundreds of millions, two billion,” that last reference being to the recent sale of the Los Angeles Clippers from Donald Sterling to Steve Ballmer. James also noted the reported anglings of the Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov to cash out, or at least merge operations, with the Guggenheim group, which owns the Los Angeles Dodgers. James’s bottom line: Future cries of poverty “will not fly with us.” He speaks as a league lightning rod, not just its most leveraged player. As a businessman with visions beyond the court and even the sport, James has more on his mind than extracting the most money he can from the Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert, though he astutely rejoined the Cavs in July with a plan to do that, too. James signed a two-year contract starting at about $20 million (with a player option to exit following this season). In other words, he will be eligible for his next deal just as the enormousness of the new television deals affects the league, the players’ share of revenue and team salary caps. His told-you-so was casually expressed: “I kind of knew something was in the works and something was going to get done, as far as with Turner and ESPN and our league. Everyone should be educated about it.” Not everyone, however, is James, who paid his respects to the former commissioner David Stern, saying, “He built our league; he built our brand.” But make no mistake: James’s supreme role model remains  Not only is Jordan’s team shedding its standard lousiness, he will also soon become one of 30 owner beneficiaries of the television windfalls. Small wonder James will resume wearing No. 23 — a number made iconic by Jordan with Chicago — after switching to No. 6 in Miami the past four years. Jordan also won six titles, an ambition often ascribed to James. He is only one-third of the way there, but were he given a choice of matching Jordan in ring collection or boardroom control, the smart money would be on the latter. James, who looked much older than the teenager he was entering the league 11 years ago, understands there will be much to leverage after 40. He dodged the ownership question, but James Jones, who followed James to Cleveland from Miami, said: “I know that in order to bring value to something like this N.B.A. brand, you really have to be invested. You have to breathe it, live it, and that’s what makes someone like LeBron so successful at what he does. And it’s becoming more of a natural progression for that kind of player to want to be the owner or the part owner of something that they love, the institution that they dedicated their livelihoods to.” It’s easy to lambaste superstars like James for seeming to want more. But when viewed through the prism of building the kind of bridge Jordan did, the process can be framed as a progressive and necessary antidote to the haplessness that befell the N.B.A. in the regressive cases involving Sterling and, more recently, Bruce Levenson, Atlanta’s controlling owner. Jordan runs the show in Charlotte. Magic Johnson, who works with the Guggenheim group, might soon have a seat at the table in Brooklyn. You get the feeling that James plans on being around this game for a while, and not as an analyst or coach. Asked if he would make his presence felt when new collective bargaining is likely to occur in 2017, James said, “I’m the guy that kind of has the power, I guess, without having to put a name on it.” He meant as the Cavs’ union rep, not the backroom power he ultimately is shooting for.
