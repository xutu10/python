Marreese Speights scored 16 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter, and the Golden State Warriors defeated the host Charlotte Hornets, 106-101, Friday night to extend their winning streak to eight games. Stephen Curry finished with 26 points despite a poor shooting night from 3-point range, and Klay Thompson added 17 points for the Warriors (13-2). Brian Roberts scored 20 points and Al Jefferson had 18 points for the struggling Hornets, who have lost eight straight games and 10 of their last 11. Cody Zeller had 15 points and 14 rebounds and Kemba Walker had 13 points and 13 rebounds for Charlotte (4-13). Curry, making his return to Charlotte, where he played high school basketball and starred at nearby Davidson College, was just 1 of 10 from 3-point range. But he finished 9 of 20 from the field and made all seven of his free-throw attempts. The Warriors outrebounded the Hornets on offense, 16-8. BULLS 109, CELTICS 102  Boston has lost six of seven. Jared Sullinger led Boston with 23 points and 10 rebounds. Avery Bradley had 18 points and Brandon Bass 16 points and 9 rebounds. Rajon Rondo had 8 points, 7 rebounds and 9 assists for the Celtics. With the score tied at 100-100, Jeff Green’s driving basket put the Celtics ahead with two and a half minutes left. After each team failed to score on a couple of possessions, Butler’s two free throws tied it with 80 seconds to play. Rondo missed two free throws and Sullinger front-rimmed a 3-point attempt before two more free throws from Butler moved the Bulls ahead for good, 104-102, with 51 seconds left. Noah then hit a short jumper on the Bulls’ next possession. BUCKS 104, PISTONS 88  Milwaukee did not have a single starter score in double figures, but got 69 points off the bench to send the Pistons to their seventh straight loss. The teams were playing for the third time this month and the second time in four days. The Pistons got one their three wins this season against the Bucks on Nov. 7, but Milwaukee answered with a 98-86 victory on Tuesday.
