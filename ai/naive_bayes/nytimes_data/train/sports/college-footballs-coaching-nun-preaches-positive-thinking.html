College Football's Coaching Nun Preaches Positive Thinking

DULUTH, Minn. — The celebration after the College of St. Scholastica won its fourth consecutive conference football championship resembled an extended family gathering. Oblivious to the numbing cold, players, coaches, their families and students lingered on the field, exchanging hugs and posing with the Upper Midwest Athletic Conference championship banner. In the midst of it, Mike Lehmann, a beefy reserve offensive lineman, approached an assistant coach with a request. “Coach, my mom wants a picture,” he said. So Lehmann wrapped an arm around the diminutive coach in the dark blue winter jacket and matching fleece headband, who is beloved around this little Catholic school for a quick smile and inspiring manner — Sister Lisa Maurer, the Benedictine nun who coaches kickers and punters for the 10-0 Saints. “They’re good kids; they’re awesome,” she said. “It just adds another layer of living our mission and living our values. It brings it full circle. I find it an honor that I get to do this, that I get to represent my religious community in this way.” Maurer, who is known as Sister Lisa, is one of 87 sisters from the Benedictine Order living in the monastery at St. Scholastica, a Division III college here on a bluff overlooking Lake Superior. “A lot of people who aren’t around the program say, how is a nun coaching you?” said Mike Theismann, a senior kicker. “She fits in seamlessly. It’s not a big deal, for the players or the coaches.” Maurer, 44, is 5 feet 2 inches with blue eyes, a smattering of freckles and short brown hair. She grew up around sports. Her father, Gene, coached high school football in Sleepy Eye, Minn.; as a child, she occasionally helped him line the field. She played softball at Southwest Minnesota State University, as a catcher. She coached basketball, volleyball and softball at a Catholic school in her hometown before entering the convent. Trading one devotion for another meant giving up something she dearly loved. “The one thing that was holding me back, seriously, was coaching, that special relationship you have with your student-athletes,” Maurer said. “The competition, the adrenaline, all that. I was like, oh my gosh, I’ll never get that again if I enter the monastery or enter religious life.” Maurer came to St. Scholastica in 2007, the year before the college fielded its first football team. A women’s college at its founding in 1912, St. Scholastica went coed in 1969 but struggled to attract male students. College officials added football to try to boost male enrollment. Even now, two-thirds of the 1,900 students on the main campus are women. Maurer’s fourth-floor room at the monastery overlooks the football practice field, and the sound of whistles and the clacking of shoulder pads offered too enticing a distraction. Maurer often went for walks around the field saying her rosary, or sat in the bleachers. The program’s founding coach, Greg Carlson, got to know her, asked her to lead prayers, and discovered she could talk sports as knowledgeably as anybody on campus. Last season, the team awarded Maurer its annual  Curiosity brought Maurer to the news conference for  Maurer invited Ramler to dinner and prayers with the sisters at the monastery. After several more conversations, the forward-thinking Ramler — a free spirit who rarely wears socks, even on the coldest days — invited Maurer to join his coaching staff. Maurer spent so much time watching practice that Ramler figured he might as well put her to work. “When I’m looking for an assistant coach, I’m looking for people who are intelligent, hard-working and care about the kids,” Ramler said. “She has all those qualities. It’s all about that. “Anybody who talks to Sister Lisa more than half a minute knows how intelligent she is, and also knows that she’s passionate, and she loves Saints football. To me, it was an absolute no-brainer.” Olson and Sister Lois Eckes, the prioress of the monastery, approved the unusual arrangement. “I have to admit, I was surprised,” Olson said. “I knew she had coached before. But in a very short period of time, I’ve learned Kurt is full of surprises.” Eckes, though, wondered how Maurer could balance work with her prayer life. Already an administrator in the Benedictine Health System, a supervisory position requiring frequent travel in the Midwest, Maurer is pursuing a master’s degree in pastoral ministry at St. John’s. Ramler told Maurer to come to practice when she could. “We see it as a wonderful vocation that we didn’t plan for,” Eckes said. “She’s making history. We’re all making history.” Meanwhile, Maurer augmented her limited kicking knowledge by watching video and researching the Internet. It helped that Theismann, a four-time all-conference selection who also punts, needed minimal supervision. He has four field goals this season, including one for 48 yards, a school record, and led the conference in kick scoring with 67 points. His conversations with Maurer involve positive thinking more than mechanics. Before games and at halftime, she fields kicks for him. “She’s boisterous,” Theismann said. “She’s loud. She gets us fired up. I know everyone in their head kind of has this stereotype of a nun, and she doesn’t really fit that at all. She knows sports. She loves football. I think she enjoys being out there as much as anybody.” But Maurer never forgets her spiritual side. In a solemn church ceremony before the season, Maurer and Eckes gave each player a St. Benedict medal, which is said to protect them from harm. Most wear them under their pads or carry them in their equipment bag. At the pregame breakfast, Maurer passes out cards with a prayer for the day. Players often approach her for guidance about faith and life issues. “I’ve had a lot of the guys talk to me about her positive influence,” Ramler said. “Her being a member of the order doesn’t hurt, of course. It’s just the person she is. It helps all of us keep the right perspective on what matters most.” St. Scholastica plays home games at an area high school. It was there, on Nov. 8, that the Saints beat Greenville College, of Illinois, 42-14, to wrap up the U.M.A.C. title and a second unbeaten regular season in four years. They will travel to play St. John’s in the first round of the N.C.A.A. Division III playoffs on Saturday. Maurer spent much of the Greenville game pacing the sideline, clapping, encouraging players. When Theismann hooked a 47-yard field goal attempt in the first quarter, Maurer left him alone, waiting until he approached her to broach the subject. “We talked about it quick, and she said, move on, move past it,” he said. The Saints pulled away with four consecutive touchdowns in the second and third quarters, three on Tyler Harper passes to Andrew Smith. Maurer beamed as she moved through the postgame celebration, sharing joy and gratitude with a football family she never expected to have. “I get to coach and be a sister both,” she said. “I remember all the tears that I cried when I entered religious life because I never thought I’d get to do this. The Lord is so good to me.”
