CARSON, Calif. —  When Robbie Keane accepted the Major League Soccer most valuable player award last week, he said he would gladly trade the trophy for another one — the M.L.S. Cup. On Sunday, Keane made sure he got them both, delivering an overtime goal that lifted the Los Angeles Galaxy to their fifth title and third in four seasons, with a 2-1 victory over the New England Revolution before a raucous sellout crowd on their home field. Keane took a long pass from Marcelo Sarvas in the 108th minute and put the ball past goalkeeper Bobby Shuttleworth to cap what had been a wide open, if at times sloppy championship. Keane, a 34-year-old star from Ireland, then did his trademark cartwheel toward the corner flag. The Galaxy then had to stave off an onslaught from New England, which threw everyone forward in the final minutes. This sort of ending was nothing new for the Revolution, whose five M.L.S. Cup appearances have all been decided in extra time, and all resulted in losses. The game ended 1-1 in regulation after Gyasi Zardes had given the Galaxy a 1-0 lead in the 52nd minute and Chris Tierney answered with in the 79th minute. The victory was also a celebratory sendoff for Landon Donovan, who announced in August that he would retire after the season. Donovan, the leading scorer in M.L.S. and for the United States in international play, also claimed his record sixth M.L.S. Cup, two of which he won with the San Jose Earthquakes.
