With Replacement Injured, Bears Again Turn to Jay Cutler
After a week on the bench, Cutler will start Chicago’s final game because his replacement, Jimmy Clausen, sustained a concussion in Sunday’s loss to Detroit.

Quarterback Jay Cutler is returning to the  The Bears benched Cutler for Sunday’s 20-14 loss to Detroit, in which Clausen was injured on a helmet-to-helmet hit by Detroit’s Ezekiel Ansah. Ansah received an unnecessary roughness penalty. Coach Marc Trestman would not say on Monday whether a healthy Clausen would have made another start. “That’s not an issue right now,” he said. Trestman decided last week to make a change, with Cutler leading the league in interceptions (18) and turnovers (24). It was a surprising move, as the team had signed Cutler to an expensive seven-year deal after last season, and it raised big questions about his future in Chicago. MORE PROBLEMS FOR BROWNS Coach Mike Pettine said Hoyer had sustained the injury when he was hit making a long throw against Carolina. Hoyer had entered the game after Manziel, making his second start, injured his hamstring. Manziel has been ruled out of Sunday’s season finale in Baltimore. If Hoyer cannot play, the rookie Connor Shaw will start. Shaw, an undrafted free agent from South Carolina, has spent this season on the practice squad. MIAMI COACH TO STAY Philbin said he had been so consumed with preparing his team for its 37-35 win over the Minnesota Vikings and the coming showdown with the Jets that hearing the news “wasn’t a big deal.” “I’m just concerned about playing the New York Jets and winning this football game, period,” said Philbin, who carries a 23-24 record into the final game. NEW MCDONALD ACCUSATION The woman told the authorities that she had no memory of the sexual encounter that occurred in McDonald’s house in San Jose, Calif., which the police said had occurred Dec. 14, a few hours after the 49ers returned from Seattle, where they lost, 17-7, to the Seahawks. The court papers quote McDonald as saying in a text message that he believed the encounter had been consensual. McDonald also told the police that the entire episode had been captured on a video system in his house. No charges have been filed, and the San Jose police were investigating. McDonald could not be reached for comment, and his agent, Tom Condon, did not immediately reply to text and phone messages. DETROIT PLAYER SUSPENDED The punishment was handed down by Merton Hanks, the N.F.L.’s vice president for football operations. The violation was Raiola’s sixth related to player safety. BILLS RELEASE RECEIVER After going unclaimed, Williams had to recover from a calf injury before the Bills could cut him. FANS INJURED IN TAMPA Tampa fire officials said the lightning strike had happened as fans were walking to their cars in a stadium parking lot.
