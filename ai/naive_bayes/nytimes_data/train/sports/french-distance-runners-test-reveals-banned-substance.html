A French distance runner, Laila Traby, underwent a doping test after the police found the banned performance-enhancer erythropoietin in her apartment in the Pyrenees and held her in custody, the French Athletics Federation said. Traby, 35, finished third in the 10,000 meters at the European Championships in August, behind Jo Pavey of Britain and silver medalist Clemence Calvin of France. The French Athletics Federation confirmed the details on Wednesday, without saying when she was tested or when the results would be known. “I’m going through a tough time at the moment. I’ve been falsely accused. I’m the victim of a conspiracy, I’ve really been trapped and it’s a complete set-up,” Traby wrote on her Facebook page. “The truth will come out and I remain confident. Several people were with me during this training camp and so are likely to be involved in this affair from near or afar.” Pavey won the 10,000 in Zurich in 32 minutes, 22.39 seconds, 1.19 seconds fasten then Calvin. Traby took bronze in 32:26.03. “I’ve never had any problems. I’m used to being tested and it’s not at 35 years old that I’m going to start messing up,” Traby wrote. “I’m an honest athlete and I have nothing to reproach myself for.”
