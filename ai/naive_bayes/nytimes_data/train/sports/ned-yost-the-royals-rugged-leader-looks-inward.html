Ned Yost, the Royals’ Rugged Leader, Looks Inward
Fired as manager of the Milwaukee Brewers in 2008, Yost now has the Kansas City Royals in position to make the playoffs for the first time since 1985.

CLEVELAND —  In late September 2008, after Ned Yost was fired as manager of the Milwaukee Brewers with 12 games left in the season, he went home to Georgia. He did not watch baseball or follow the playoff race. Instead, he worked on his 700-acre farm, building feeders. Every day, he hunted deer with his sons and a group of friends that included the comedian Jeff Foxworthy, who owned a farm nearby. This was Yost’s happy place. But every so often he wondered to himself what had gone wrong in Milwaukee. Six years later, Yost is sure he has an answer. He sat cross-legged in the visiting manager’s office on Tuesday afternoon at Progressive Field, as the manager of the Kansas City Royals, recalling what he had learned and how he had grown. He left it unsaid that he had a chance to redeem himself. The last week of the regular season had just started, and Yost was back in the public eye. Every game was important. Every move he made was scrutinized. And he had the Royals in position to make the playoffs for the first time since 1985. He spat tobacco juice into a Starbucks cup. “It was kind of like going through the same thing, you know?” he said. Both jobs had been remarkably similar: teams from the Midwest that had not made the playoffs in decades, each with a core of young players who needed time to develop. When Yost was hired in Milwaukee, the Brewers had not made the playoffs since 1982. Over the next few years, they cultivated a group that included Rickie Weeks, J. J. Hardy, Corey Hart, Prince Fielder and Ryan Braun. In 2007, Yost’s fifth year in charge, the Brewers led the National League Central by eight and a half games in June. But after a slow collapse, they finished two games behind the Chicago Cubs in the division. Yost was ejected four times in September. He had a reputation for losing his cool and being rigid in his decision-making, and at times he appeared defensive and combative. He was not exactly a fan favorite. A former backup catcher, Yost was an old-school type. Two of his mentors were Bobby Cox and Dale Earnhardt. The next year, the Brewers traded for C. C. Sabathia midseason and were in control of the wild-card race entering September. But they started that month 3-11, and Yost was fired with 12 games left in a last-ditch effort to salvage the season. Guided by Dale Sveum, the Brewers finished the season 7-5 and clinched a wild-card spot, aided in part by the Mets’ embarrassing collapse. Yost followed none of it. He retreated home, went hunting and contemplated what had gone wrong. He took about a year off from baseball until Dayton Moore, the Royals’ general manager, persuaded him to come on in a consulting role. A few months later, during the 2010 season, Moore hired Yost as manager to replace the fired Trey Hillman. At the time, the Royals were developing Alex Gordon, Danny Duffy, Salvador Perez, Eric Hosmer and Greg Holland — their future core. In 2013, that group propelled the Royals to their first winning season since 2003. They finished only three games out of the second wild-card spot, raising expectations for this season. The Royals were in the same position the Brewers occupied entering Yost’s last year in Milwaukee. “What I learned more than anything else is that once the game starts, there are a lot of things you can’t control,” Yost said. “I can’t control if the other team scores two runs in the first. I can’t control if we strike out with the bases loaded. In Milwaukee, I always thought there was something I could do to control those situations.” In Milwaukee, he added, he tried to get his players to play the way he did. He was too inflexible, and never made the transition from development into win-now mode. “I always felt like I was driving myself crazy,” he said, “trying to figure out: What can I do to help this, what can I do to help that? You know?” He paused. “It’s a lot easier this time around.” When Yost said that, the Royals were closing in on a playoff spot. Getting there had not been easy. They started the season slowly, their offense had come and gone, and their record against the Detroit Tigers, their rivals in the American League Central, was 6-13. Because the Royals’ offense is so inconsistent, their games are often close, intense affairs, pushing Yost and his tactical decisions to the forefront. Every move is watched closely, making him a polarizing figure among Royals fans. “It’s very much a love-hate relationship,” said Rany Jazayerli, a lifelong Royals fan who co-founded Baseball Prospectus and writes about the team. “We’re all learning how to behave in a pennant race,” he added. “None of us have much practice in this. I can’t say that we’re handling it with the experience of a veteran. We’re bouncing off the walls from day to day.” Jazayerli also noted, “His tactical decisions can be, to put it mildly, aggravating.” This month, Yost refused to use his seventh-inning reliever, Kelvin Herrera, in the sixth, and the reliever Yost summoned allowed a grand slam. About a week later, Yost allowed Nori Aoki, his hottest hitter at the time, to lay down two sacrifice bunts in the first three innings. Neither bunt yielded a run. In late August, moments after Gordon had hit a game-ending home run, Yost complained about the number of fans who attended the game. He has also admitted that he has found it easier to manage games on the road, because at home he has placed more pressure on himself to send the fans home happy. James Shields, the Royals’ ace and leader, said that Yost let the players police themselves, play their own music in the clubhouse and wear jeans on the road. “He believes in us,” Shields said. “That’s all that really matters to us. We don’t care what anybody else thinks as long as we know he has our back.” As of Wednesday morning, the Royals could guarantee a playoff spot by winning three of their final five games. With Wednesday’s game, Yost set the record for most games managed in Royals history: 771. “I guess it’s nice,” Yost said, shrugging. “I haven’t had time to think about it. I just want to win baseball games. I want to help get this team to the playoffs. “That’d mean more than anything.”
