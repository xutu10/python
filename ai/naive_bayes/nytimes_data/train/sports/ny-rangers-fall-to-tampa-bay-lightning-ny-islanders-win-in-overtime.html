Ryan Callahan scored twice against his former team for the second time in 10 days, and the host  Martin St. Louis, a former Lightning captain, was playing at Tampa Bay for the first time since requesting a trade and being dealt to the Rangers for Callahan in March in a rare swap of captains. Tampa Bay went ahead, 3-2, when Steven Stamkos skated behind the net and got his second assist of the game by setting up Callahan, who beat Henrik Lundqvist from in close 10 minutes 17 seconds into the second period. ISLANDERS The Islanders have set a franchise record by winning 16 of their first 22 games. They are 10-1-0 in their last 11 games and are 7-0 this season in games that went to overtime. Jaroslav Halak made 25 saves for his eighth straight win. Alex Ovechkin scored twice for the Capitals.
