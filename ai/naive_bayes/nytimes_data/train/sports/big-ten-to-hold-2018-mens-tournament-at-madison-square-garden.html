The Big Ten Conference will hold its 2018 men’s basketball tournament at Madison Square Garden, Commissioner Jim Delany said Saturday night. “We wanted to get out there as soon as we could,” Delany said in a phone interview. The Big Ten was set to make a formal announcement Tuesday afternoon. Sports Illustrated first reported the move Saturday. Delany also said that the Big Ten would stage a men’s basketball and men’s hockey doubleheader at the Garden starting in 2016. The first doubleheader will feature Michigan and Penn State. Expanding to the East Coast has been a priority for the traditionally Midwestern Big Ten. This year, the conference added Rutgers and Maryland. In 2017, the conference will hold its men’s basketball tournament at Verizon Center in Washington, near Maryland’s College Park campus. The Big Ten is not the only major conference with its eye on the New York area. The Atlantic Coast Conference will hold its men’s basketball tournament at Barclays Center in 2017 and 2018. The 2018 Big Ten tournament will run from Feb. 20 to March 4, before most major conferences hold their tournaments and a week before the N.C.A.A. tournament field is selected. “It’s an extra week to prepare or rest up,” Delany said. “Some may play a nonconference game, but most may just rest.” Fran McCaffery, Iowa’s fifth-year coach, said he was pleased the tournament would be played at the Garden. “It is what they say it is,” he said. “It’s the world’s most famous arena.” The tournament will be held in Chicago this season and in Indianapolis in 2016.
