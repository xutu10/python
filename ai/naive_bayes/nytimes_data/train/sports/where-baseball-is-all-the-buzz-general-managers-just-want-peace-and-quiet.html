Where Baseball Is All the Buzz, General Managers Just Want Peace and Quiet
For years, executives at the winter meetings made trades in hushed hotel lobbies, but big-money deals now usually take place away from frenzied gatherings of fans, scouts, reporters and agents.
===
Early one morning,  The lobby, restaurants and bars were packed with fans, scouts, managers, minor league officials, reporters, executives and agents, a gigantic Christmas tree in the center of it all. They talked among themselves, but their eyes darted to and fro, looking for someone perhaps more useful to talk to — someone like Cashman. Some of them were there to shake him down for his Yankees millions. Some were looking for a job, an autograph, a shred of information. “You can’t even walk across the lobby anymore,” Cashman said recently, reflecting on experiences like that one. “It takes forever. Now, more and more, you just sit in the suite and do your business in there.” There was a time, not too long ago, when general managers could sit alone in the lobbies and make trades. Not now. Baseball’s winter meetings, which begin Monday in San Diego, are the largest major sport convention in the country, an off-season gem during which hundreds of millions of dollars are committed, careers change forever, and rumors and beer flow nightly. Everywhere you look and listen, baseball is the buzz, with the entire proceedings instantly tabulated on Twitter like a breakneck stock ticker. Football has its scouting combine, and basketball has its summer league. But nothing compares to the frenzy of the winter meetings. They have existed, in various forms, for well over 100 years — historical references date to 1876 — and in their current form exist as a five-day baseball showcase that Cashman called “a necessary evil.” At the National League meetings in New York in 1899, owners discussed appointing a supervisor of umpires to “include in his reports all testimony affecting the language, conduct and behavior of the players,” according to the minutes of those meetings, supplied by the library of the Baseball Hall of Fame. The 1919 N.L. meetings, held at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan, featured high-powered baseball executives like Charles Ebbets of the Dodgers, Charles Stoneham (Giants), William Veeck Sr. (Cubs), Branch Rickey (Cardinals) and Lon Hocker (also Cardinals). During a discussion of a telegraph contract that was due to expire, Hocker urged that a new deal should be secured forthwith because telegraph rates “may increase rather than decrease.” William Baker of the Athletics promptly told his bewildered colleague, “They pay us, Mr. Hocker.” Hocker — not the only person who ever failed to keep up with the dizzying pace of the winter meetings — is barely heard from again in the minutes. But for many, being paid is what the meetings are all about, with player agents lurking everywhere. In Dallas in 2000, Alex Rodriguez, Manny Ramirez and Mike Hampton received contracts totaling more than $533 million combined from the Texas Rangers, the Boston Red Sox and the Colorado Rockies. In Orlando in 2010, the Red Sox and the Washington Nationals gave deals worth a combined $268 million to Carl Crawford and Jayson Werth. Scott Boras “There is something about the meetings that makes deals just happen,” Cashman said. “It’s like a jury. They throw everyone in there, and it’s like, ‘Go ahead; make deals.’ ” In Louisville, Ky., in 1992, Barry Bonds got his first free-agent deal — $43 million over six years from the San Francisco Giants. Right before he signed, the Giants executive Peter Magowan met with Bonds in his hotel suite and asked if there was anything else he wanted. Bonds looked around and requested something that has since become standard for big free-agent contracts: a hotel suite on the road. “Barry negotiated the final detail of the contract himself,” said his former agent Dennis Gilbert, a fixture at the meetings since the early 1980s — now as a special adviser to Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, one of the few owners regularly seen patrolling the lobbies. “There are always the big free-agent deals,” Gilbert said. “But for a lot of agents, you are there trying to get a job for your minor league free agents and nontenders. But it’s a great time because you are surrounded by baseball people, the best people in the world.” The meetings are often held in convention cities or locations that have a minor league presence, like Indianapolis, Louisville, Nashville and Orlando, Fla. The meetings also feature a tremendous trade show where just about anything associated with baseball — 20,000 bobbleheads, a million bags of peanuts, foul poles, scoreboards, radar guns — can be bought. Jack McKeon, who first attended the winter meetings in the 1950s when he was a minor league catcher and went to Louisville seeking a managerial job, thrived on making trades as the San Diego Padres’ general manager from 1981 to 1990, especially at the winter meetings. Now he laments the direction the meetings have taken, with the influx of fans, television and radio personnel, and job seekers — even though some current executives were once lobby dwellers themselves, including the Padres’ current G.M., A. J. Preller (in 1999). Most of the meetings’ business is conducted in suites, and teams keep their cards close to the vest. “Everything is so secretive now,” McKeon said. “Everyone just sits in their suites and texts everyone else. No one just hangs out in the lobby anymore. I used to sit right there as if I had a sign: ‘I’m right here. I’m open for business.’ I wanted to be seen.” In 1983, McKeon was able to pull off a deal for Carmelo Martinez because Dallas Green, then the general manager of the Chicago Cubs, told him in the lobby that he wanted Scott Sanderson from the Montreal Expos but could not get him. McKeon already knew he could get Sanderson from a previous lobby conversation with the Expos, and a few hours later, a three-team deal was struck. “Then at 2 in the morning, we’d invite the writers up to the room to tell them about it, have a few belts and talk about baseball,” said McKeon, currently an adviser to the Miami Marlins. McKeon was so invigorated by trading at the meetings that he once made a minor deal with the Tigers after bumping into Detroit G.M. Bill Lajoie in line to check out of the hotel. Within minutes of leaving, he still managed to complete a trade. The meetings still include some official business. The veterans committee votes on Hall of Fame membership, the Baseball Writers’ Association of America holds its annual meetings, and all major league managers are invited to a luncheon with beat reporters. Well, not all the managers. In Boston in 2001, when the Mets traded for Roberto Alomar, the team’s G.M., Steve Phillips, barred Manager Bobby Valentine from the meetings. They did not get along, and Phillips accused Valentine of intimidating other staff members. In 2003, the owner  In Louisville a decade earlier, during a period when he was barred from any involvement with the Yankees, Steinbrenner was still allowed to speak with Joe Molloy, his son-in-law, who was running the team in his absence. Steinbrenner called the Yankees’ suite to talk to Molloy; Buck Showalter, who had recently been appointed manager, answered. The minutes for the encounter were not kept, but it was said to go like this: STEINBRENNER: Who the hell is this? SHOWALTER: Who the hell is this? STEINBRENNER (screaming): This is George Steinbrenner. Get me Joe Molloy. SHOWALTER: Sorry, wrong number. (Click.) Of course, after an unnerving encounter like that, there is only one way to recover: Head down to the hotel lobby, grab a beer and talk some baseball.
