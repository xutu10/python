Week 4 N.F.L. Matchups
A look at how teams match up for this weekend’s games.
===
Packers 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Packers by 1 ½ “Five letters here just for everybody out there in Packerland: R-E-L-A-X.” Those were the words of Aaron Rodgers, the embattled Green Bay quarterback, on his radio show this week in response to concerns over the team’s rough start. A preseason pick to be among the best teams in the N.F.C., Green Bay is 1-2, and Rodgers’s performance has some fans worried. If Rodgers seems unconcerned for a player completing the lowest percentage of passes in his career while throwing for fewer than 200 yards in two of three games, it is probably because he has been in this position before. In each of the last two seasons, the Packers were 1-2 but made the playoffs. Rodgers believes this season will also work out in their favor. Rodgers has played well against Chicago’s formidable defenses, and with age and injury having hit the Bears hard, there is no reason to believe he cannot break out of his slump with a division win on the road. Even more reason for confidence is that on the other side of the ball, the Green Bay defense will be facing its favorite punching bag, Jay Cutler. In compiling a 1-8 career record against Green Bay, Cutler was sacked 31 times, threw 17 interceptions (his most against any opponent) and recorded a passer rating of 65.1 (his worst against any team he has faced more than twice). Cutler faced the Packers in the playoffs during the 2010 season and had a 31.8 rating before leaving the game with various injuries. He then watched from the sideline as the third-string quarterback Caleb Hanie tried to rally Chicago into contention. Clay Matthews, the Packers linebacker who sacked Cutler during that game and most likely contributed to his injuries, said at the time, “Kinda wish they would have had Jay in there the whole time the way things were going.” Matthews left Week 3’s loss with a groin injury, putting his status for this game in doubt. But Julius Peppers will more than make up for the potential absence in his return to Chicago after signing with Green Bay this season. Pick: Packers Eagles 4:25 p.m. Sunday Line: 49ers by 4 ½ After a promising first half against Dallas in Week 1, San Francisco has hardly looked like the team that went to three consecutive N.F.C. championship games. On offense, the 49ers are scuffling, but that can be largely attributed to the absence of the injured Vernon Davis and an inability to get the run game going. Those are fixable problems. The San Francisco defense has a more difficult situation to remedy; the secondary seems far below the standards of the unit’s recent past. San Francisco has allowed only 226 yards a game through the air, but it has yielded seven receiving touchdowns, tied for third most in the N.F.L. That spells trouble against a Philadelphia offense that is off to a blazing start despite trailing by 10 or more points at some point during each game. If Nick Foles, working behind a patchwork offensive line, can stay upright long enough to move the ball downfield, he will find little resistance from San Francisco’s defensive backs. Pick: Eagles Panthers 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Ravens by 3 ½ Receiver Steve Smith’s chance to strut his stuff against Carolina, the team that cut him loose after 13 seasons, will be the dominant story line for this game. But Lorenzo Taliaferro, Justin Forsett and the rest of Baltimore’s running backs will want to get their pregame stretching in because they might be breaking some long runs against a surprisingly porous Panthers defense. It is hard to believe how much Carolina’s defense has regressed from last season, but it is allowing 145 yards a game on the ground, and the Ravens have shown they are able to keep the ball moving without Ray Rice. At the same time that Carolina’s run defense has lost its way, the Panthers’ running game has struggled. The expected return of DeAngelo Williams should help in that regard, but if Cam Newton returns to 100 percent health, that will be a bigger boost. Pick: Ravens Saints 8:30 p.m. Sunday Line: Saints by 3 Dallas is on a bit of a roll after an ugly Week 1 loss to San Francisco. Keeping that momentum going against New Orleans could prove difficult while the Cowboys try to sort out their secondary. Cornerback Morris Claiborne, who did not start in Week 3, walked out on the team when he was informed that Orlando Scandrick would take his place in the lineup. The drama could not come at a worse time as Drew Brees and the potent Saints passing game comes to town. With quarterback Tony Romo missing practice to rest his ailing back, and the fragile DeMarco Murray having carried the ball 75 times, the Cowboys can hardly be expected to be at full strength, which is good news for the ineffective New Orleans defense. Pick: Saints Bills (2-1) at Texans (2-1) 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Texans by 3 After Houston lost to the struggling Giants in Week 3, the Texans were being asked if they could repeat 2013, when they went 0-14 to close the season. To avoid that fate, Houston will need to get running back Arian Foster back quickly from a hamstring injury that makes him questionable for this game. The Texans’ offense is largely built around getting the ball to Foster, and without him, Ryan Fitzpatrick melted down with three interceptions in the 30-17 loss to the Giants. Buffalo has looked good in the second year of the E J Manuel era, and a second win on the road would be a great confidence booster. Pick: Bills Titans (1-2) at Colts (1-2) 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Colts by 7 ½ These teams are meeting at an awkward point: They have the same record, but Tennessee’s prospects are plummeting while Indianapolis is on the way up. The Titans have been outscored, 59-17, in their last two games, and may have to face the Colts without quarterback Jake Locker, who injured his wrist in a Week 3 loss to the Bengals. Indianapolis has won 10 of its last 11 games against Tennessee. The Colts righted the ship with a blowout win over Jacksonville after the first losing streak of Andrew Luck’s career. Tennessee’s defense is better than it has looked in the last two weeks, but Luck should be able to put on a show at home. Pick: Colts Falcons (2-1) at Vikings (1-2) 4:25 p.m. Sunday Line: Falcons by 3 Atlanta has gone 2-0 at home while outscoring opponents by 93-48. The Falcons lost their first road game, 24-10. In other words, as much as other things change, Matt Ryan’s home dominance and road woes stay the same. The X factor in this game will be the start of the Teddy Bridgewater era in Minnesota. Forced into the starting lineup by a season-ending injury to Matt Cassel, Bridgewater will try to guide the struggling Vikings offense without two of its top playmakers, Adrian Peterson and Kyle Rudolph. The future appears bright with Bridgewater under center. But even against a team that struggles on the road, Minnesota may be a bit too greedy if it expects everything to come together immediately. Pick: Falcons Buccaneers (0-3) at Steelers (2-1) 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Steelers by 7 ½ The good news for Tampa Bay is that this game should be nowhere near as lopsided as Week 3’s 56-14 loss to Atlanta. Generally, teams let up a bit when the game gets out of hand, so even if Pittsburgh dominates, a 42-point loss is unlikely. When that is all the positive news for an N.F.L. team, fans may want to start thinking about next season. Pick: Steelers Lions (2-1) at Jets (1-2) 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Lions by 2 ½ “I think everybody’s behind Geno,” Jets Coach Rex Ryan, referring to Geno Smith, told reporters. “He’s our quarterback and our football team believes in him, so that’s it.” Having to defend the supposed franchise quarterback so early in the season is bad news for the Jets. But it is worth wondering whether Smith is the answer, given that Chicago’s Ryan Mundy intercepted his first pass and returned it for a 45-yard touchdown that set the tone for a Jets loss in Week 3. With Detroit’s Ndamukong Suh harassing him in the backfield, Smith will have to make decisions quickly, and that does not appear to be his strong suit. Pick: Lions Jaguars (0-3) at Chargers (2-1) 4:05 p.m. Sunday Line: Chargers by 13 ½ The spread might seem extreme, but given that Jacksonville has been outscored by 75 points this season, it might even be conservative. Quarterback Philip Rivers can do damage against any defense, and the Chargers should be able to score at will against the Jaguars. Pick: Chargers Dolphins (1-2) at Raiders (0-3) 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Dolphins by 3 ½ The idea of playing N.F.L. games at Wembley Stadium in London was to show off the sport to a European audience. When the British fans get a look at Oakland in action, they will probably wonder why the N.F.L. has not considered the concept of relegating its worst teams to lower-level leagues as in professional soccer. Pick: Dolphins Patriots (2-1) at Chiefs (1-2) 8:30 p.m. Monday Line: Patriots by 3 ½ Long ago, New England had a tough defense, spectacular special teams and a young quarterback named Tom Brady who did just enough to win games. Over the years, the franchise evolved into an offensive powerhouse and a defensive question mark. Now the Patriots have come full circle, with Coach Bill Belichick’s defense doing the heavy lifting as Brady struggles. One of the main problems has been that New England’s offensive line has a hard time keeping Brady on his feet. That job will not get any easier against Kansas City, which will have Justin Houston and Tamba Hali in the Patriots’ backfield all day. With a raucous home crowd, and Jamaal Charles expected to return, the Chiefs could get a much-needed win in a rough three-game stretch in which they face New England, San Francisco and San Diego. Pick: Chiefs
