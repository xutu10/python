Giants (3-3) at Cowboys (5-1)
Matchups to watch in Sunday’s game between N.F.C. East rivals.
===
4:25 p.m. Eastern, Fox Matchup to watch Cowboys vs. Giants’ Jason Pierre-Paul The Dallas offensive line has been the strength of the team, and Smith, a left tackle, has been the unit’s most dominant player. Defensive end Pierre-Paul has just one and a half sacks this season, but he has been fearsome against the run and has disrupted many passing plays by forcing the quarterback out of the pocket. Pierre-Paul could be the key to taking the Cowboys’ offense out of its rhythm. But if Smith wins most of the battles with Pierre-Paul, the Giants’ defense is in trouble. Even Perry Fewell, the Giants’ defensive coordinator, was excited about watching the matchup. “Smith is the linchpin of their offense,” he said. “And we’ve got our best guy on him. I think it will be a heavyweight battle.” Number to watch 6 100-yard rushing games by DeMarco Murray for the Cowboys this season. Murray leads the N.F.L. in rushing. The last Cowboy to lead the league in rushing was Emmitt Smith in 1995. Quotation of the Week  ‘We have all known Tony Romo to get out of the pocket and be very dangerous out of the pocket and throw one up and hope. It is not hope anymore; they are connecting.’ PERRY FEWELL, on the Cowboys’ quarterback. BILL PENNINGTON
