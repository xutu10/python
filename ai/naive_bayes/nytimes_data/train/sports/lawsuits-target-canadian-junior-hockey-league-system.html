Lawsuits Target Canadian Junior Hockey League System
A former junior hockey player is challenging the way one of Canada’s most cherished sports institutions does business.

Sam Berg, 18, did not set out to have vulgar gestures directed at him on the streets of his hometown, nor did he intend to get into seething disputes with family members. But Berg is challenging the way one of Canada’s most cherished sports institutions does business, and he said it is worth the backlash. “I am extremely happy that my career didn’t pan out,” Berg said of his brief time in junior hockey. “Because now I’m able to fight for the rights of the players.” Berg is the plaintiff in one of three class-action lawsuits against junior hockey leagues that are making their way through Canadian courts. The suits charge that by issuing stipends to players of as little as $35 a week and not providing for overtime, vacation or holiday pay, the leagues violate minimum-wage laws in every Canadian province and the American states where they operate. The suit, filed in Ontario in October, seeks about $160 million in wages, benefits and payroll contributions for thousands of current and former players in the three major junior leagues — the Ontario Hockey League, the Western Hockey League and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. The leagues have 52 clubs in Canada and eight in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Washington and Oregon. The lawsuits resemble those seeking better wages in the United States for minor league baseball players and N.F.L. cheerleaders. The push to unionize N.C.A.A. athletes is sparked by a similar impulse — to ensure that those who perform for profit-making teams and organizations receive pay and benefits. “This lawsuit is bigger than a lot of people, even I, could have guessed,” Berg said. “I think this is really part of a movement that’s going to stop exploitation of players around any game.” David Branch, the president of the Canadian Hockey League, the umbrella organization for the three leagues, and the commissioner of the O.H.L., said in a statement Friday that the leagues intended to “vigorously defend ourselves.” “Our players are some of the best amateur student-athletes in the world, and we are proud to provide them with the support, programs and tools to ensure they have the best player experience,” Branch said. He has maintained that the players are not employees or independent contractors, but young men who benefit from, among other things, first-class coaching, facilities, equipment and education. Branch told The Toronto Star that the O.H.L. teams contributed more than $2 million in college scholarships to former players during the 2013-14 season. In some ways, junior hockey resembles the apprenticeships of a bygone era. In exchange for their labor, junior players get room, board and access to higher education. First and foremost they learn a trade — hockey — playing regular-season schedules of as many as 72 games with up to five playoff rounds. Junior hockey players range in age from 16 to 20. They are drafted into the league as 15- or 16-year-olds. They can be traded or demoted. Players live with host families, often far from home, and attend high school classes structured around game and practice schedules. The lawsuits contend that they work between 35 and 65 hours a week. Those between 16 and 19 receive weekly stipends of $35 to $50; 20-year-olds receive stipends of $120 to $150. “There’s a big negative culture surrounding junior hockey in Canada,” Berg said. “It says you’ll play for free because of your love for the game.” The payoff for some is an N.H.L. career — a sure thing for a top prospect like Connor McDavid of the O.H.L. Erie Otters. But only about 5 percent of players ever reach that level. Teams also agree to pay one year of university tuition for each year the player is on a major junior team, if he does not turn pro. That is the Plan B for most players. Berg’s involvement in the lawsuit began with a dispute over an education clause in his contract. The son of Bill Berg, a former N.H.L. player, Sam Berg was drafted by the Niagara Ice Dogs of the O.H.L. and joined the team at 16. He played only eight games, all in 2013-14, before being sent to a lower league. Later that season, as Berg sat out with a shoulder injury, the Ice Dogs contended that he quit. According to Berg’s lawsuit, under his contract with the Ice Dogs the team agreed “to irrevocably guarantee funding for four years of a bachelor’s degree upon Sam playing at least one exhibition or regular season game.” Berg said that he enrolled at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, expecting the Ice Dogs and O.H.L. to cover four years of tuition. (Undergraduate tuition there is about $7,000 a year in Canadian dollars, or a bit more than $6,000 in United States currency.) But soon after he entered, he said, he received an email informing him that the team and the league would pay for only one semester. The Ice Dogs declined to comment on Berg’s version of what happened. But soon after the suit was filed, Marty Williamson, the team’s coach and general manager, told The St. Catharines Standard, “He quit and the league asked us what happened and we told them he quit, so he’s entitled to his time served and that’s one year.” Berg and his father turned to Ted Charney, a Toronto lawyer. “Ted took a look at the contract and said there’s a bigger issue here — these teams don’t even give their players minimum wage,” Berg said. “He said if you want to fight this, we’ll fight it. I said absolutely.” The suit has proved divisive in Canada. Those opposed are concerned that if players were paid, many teams would be driven out of business. Those who side with Berg say that junior teams were profitable enterprises that recently fetched prices of almost $7 million. Public reaction was polarized even in Berg’s hometown, Beamsville, Ontario, a small farming community. “I’ve gotten a lot of threats on Twitter, and some people just give me the finger in the street,” he said. Berg told TSN last month that his grandfather William Berg, the Zamboni driver at the Beamsville rink, was ashamed and angry at him for bringing a lawsuit that would ruin hockey. William Berg has said he only disagreed with his grandson, in part because he thought playing a few games did not necessarily entitle Sam to receive four years of tuition from the Ice Dogs. But Sam Berg said last week that the rift was still there. “It’s actually not better now,” he said. “We knew going in that some people were going to disagree with us. It’s just yelling, which is not a great thing to have.” The other two class-action lawsuits, filed in Alberta and Quebec later in October, are similar to the Ontario suit. Luke Walter, 21, is the plaintiff in each of those suits. He is the nephew of the former N.H.L. player Ryan Walter. Walter said he agreed to be the public face of the two lawsuits because of his 15-year-old brother, who has been drafted by the Kootenay Ice of the W.H.L. “Honestly, I could care less about me, but I’ve got a brother who got drafted, right?” Walter said. “If it’s better when he plays, my mission is accomplished.” Berg said he was finished with organized hockey and would play only in pickup games with friends. He said he planned to major in labor studies or sports management. Walter said his playing career was over as well. He is working at his father’s meat company in Langley, British Columbia. Despite his issues with the major junior leagues, he is not done with hockey. “I’m coaching a bantam team right now, so I’m definitely back,” he said. “Hockey will always be a part of you.”
