Ernie Vandeweghe, Knick and Physician, Dies at 86
A leading Knicks player of the early 1950s, Mr. Vandeweghe was also the patriarch of a three-generation family of athletes that includes the current professional tennis player Coco Vandeweghe.

Ernie Vandeweghe, a leading  His death was confirmed by his granddaughter Coco Vandeweghe, a professional tennis player, in a Facebook post. She did not specify where he had died, or the cause. Vandeweghe’s son Kiki also played for the Knicks. A basketball star at U.C.L.A., Kiki Vandeweghe played forward for 13 seasons in the N.B.A. and was later general manager of the Denver Nuggets and the Nets, whom he also coached in the 2009-10 season. A former all-American at Colgate University, Ernie Vandeweghe (pronounced VAN-deh-way) was a scrappy 6-foot-3-inch defensive-minded guard for the Knicks and a good ballhandler who could also hit a timely shot. Usually coming off the bench as a sixth man, he was in a backcourt alongside Carl Braun, his former Colgate teammate, and the future Hall of Famer Dick McGuire on teams that also featured Harry Gallatin and Sweetwater Clifton in the frontcourt. Coached by Joe Lapchick, those teams reached the N.B.A. finals three consecutive times. Vandeweghe hustled to make Knicks games at Madison Square Garden, having put in a full day as a medical student at Columbia and later as a resident in pediatrics. He sometimes arrived late and warmed up by running back and forth behind the Knicks’ bench. He missed some western road trips, and when he did play in away games, it was often a frenetic venture. “He would go to class and labs, then take the last possible plane or train to get to where the Knicks were going,” Marty Glickman, a former track star and Knicks broadcaster, recalled in his memoir “The Fastest Kid on the Block” (1996), written with Stan Isaacs. Sometimes Vandeweghe would change into his Knicks uniform in the lavatory of the plane he had taken. “I saw him come into the Butler University field house for a game against the Indianapolis Olympians with his shoelaces still untied,” Glickman remembered. “Lapchick called a timeout. Vandy ran in, tied his shoelaces and got into the play.” Vandeweghe retired from professional basketball after six seasons with the Knicks, having averaged 9.5 points a game. After his playing days, Vandeweghe had a pediatric practice in Southern California and was a team physician for the Los Angeles Lakers while his family members made their own marks in the sports world. In addition to his son Kiki, his daughter Tauna Vandeweghe competed in the women’s 100-meter backstroke at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. His son Bruk (pronounced Brook) won a bronze medal in beach volleyball at the 1994 Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia, and his daughter Heather Shannon was captain of the national women’s polo team. Tauna’s daughter Coco Vandeweghe plays on the women’s pro tennis tour. Ernie Vandeweghe’s brother-in-law, Mel Hutchins, was an outstanding N.B.A. forward in the 1950s and played for the Knicks in his final season. Ernie met his future wife, the former  Ernest Maurice Vandeweghe Jr. was born in Montreal on Sept. 12, 1928, but grew up in Oceanside, N.Y., on Long Island. His father, once a soccer player at Colgate, was a tanner who processed chinchilla skins. He was an all-American at Colgate as a senior in 1949, averaging 20.9 points a game, fifth highest in the nation. He was a member of President Gerald R. Ford’s commission to enhance America’s amateur athletic presence in international sports, and he was an associate clinical professor of pediatrics, adolescent and sports medicine at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center. In his book “Growing With Sports: A Parent’s Guide to the Young Athlete” (1979), written with George L. Flynn, Vandeweghe said he had taught his children the importance of winning as a lesson in life while presenting them with difficult athletic challenges. “The parents should see that the children win some and lose some,” he wrote. “In winning, they will become more interested and motivated. When losing, they know that if they do better, they will win.” When Kiki Vandeweghe was playing for U.C.L.A., he remarked how his father “was probably my toughest critic.” His wife died in 2010. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available. Vandeweghe worked hard to stay in basketball shape, often running up stairs during breaks in his medical studies. “Some of my classes were on the 18th floor at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital,” he once said. “But when I took my internship at Bellevue, it was only a two-story building. My legs were not as strong.” He lost a season and a half to a  The Knicks paid Vandeweghe by the game, as he was not sure whether he would be able to show up for a particular game in view of his medical obligations. “I was being paid $100 a game by the Knicks in the late 1940s,” he told Gus Alfieri for the biography “Lapchick” (2006). “People asked me why I would try to play ball while going to med school,” he told George Kalinsky in “The New York Knicks” (1996), a 50th-anniversary history of the team. “Well, I was not much of a social butterfly. My social event was to turn up in Madison Square Garden in a Knicks uniform. It was what I preferred to drinking with the boys or going to the movies.”
