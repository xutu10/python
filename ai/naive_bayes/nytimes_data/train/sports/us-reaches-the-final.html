The United States shut out top-ranked Brazil, 3-0, to make the final of the women’s volleyball world championship in Milan. The Americans rallied in the second set on their way to a 25-18, 29-27, 25-20 win. In Sunday’s final, the Americans will face either host Italy or China. Brazil, the Olympic champion, went undefeated in group play, including a victory over the United States, but it was never in control in Saturday’s match. Brazil committed 19 unforced errors. The Americans enter the final with a 10-2 record.
