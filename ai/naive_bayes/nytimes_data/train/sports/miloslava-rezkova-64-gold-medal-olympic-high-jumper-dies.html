Miloslava Rezkova, Gold Medal Olympic High Jumper, Dies at 64
Rezkova’s upset victory, at age 18, over two Soviets at the 1968 Olympics was a source of pride for recently invaded Czechoslovakia.

Miloslava Rezkova, a Czech high jumper who at 18 pulled off a major upset when she beat two better-known Russians to win a gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, setting off a burst of national pride by a country that had only recently been invaded by Soviet bloc troops, died on Sunday. She was 64. The cause was cancer, the Czech Athletics Federation said. It did not say where she died. Rezkova, whose personal best for the season was just 1.66 meters, jumped 1.82 meters (just under 6 feet) to capture the gold medal, defeating the powerful Soviet jumpers Antonina Okorokova, who took silver, and Valentina Kozyr, who took bronze. Her victory, in October, was hailed at home, coming months after the Prague Spring, a short-lived period of liberalization during the Cold War that led, in August, to a Soviet bloc invasion of the capital of what was then Czechoslovakia. Rezkova was also European champion in 1969, when she jumped 1.83 meters in Athens. A year later she married her coach, Rudolf Hubner, with whom she had a son and a daughter. She had declined a marriage proposal by a Greek millionaire, who was said to have offered her an island in the Aegean Sea as a wedding present. She retired in 1977 when her straddling style of jumping was being replaced by the Fosbury Flop, named after the American jumper Dick Fosbury, who won the 1968 Olympic high jump title for the United States using what has been called his “backwards over the bar” technique. Rezkova was born on July 22, 1950, in Prague. Information on survivors was not available.
