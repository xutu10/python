Former Louisville Guard Kevin Ware Finds a Home at Georgia State
Kevin Ware, a former Louisville guard who sustained a gruesome leg injury in the N.C.A.A. tournament in 2013, is now playing at Georgia State.

ATLANTA —  Kevin Ware anonymously traversed the Georgia State campus one day last week between the gym and classes in astronomy, history and journalism. The uninterrupted commute on foot was typical. If Ware draws attention going about his daily routine, it more likely stems from mistaken identity — he resembles a younger André 3000, the noted rap artist from Atlanta — than from his one shining moment under unimaginable duress. This time a year ago, Ware, a Louisville guard, was recovering from the ultimate avert-your-eyes sports injury in an  Though the university community meant well, Ware was reminded constantly about a memory he was trying to purge. As if being pursued by paparazzi, he mapped out back paths to classrooms and the practice gym. Then, a permanent escape route — to Georgia State, in the metro area that has been his home since middle school. On Monday, Ware, a junior and a Bronx native, will play in his first nationally televised game (at Iowa State on ESPNU) since the instant transformation from Good Basketball Player to the Guy With the Gruesome Injury. “Back in the spotlight,” he said last Friday after the Panthers opened their season with a 115-55 victory over tiny Tennessee Temple. Ware contributed 12 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists and 3 steals. The on-court movements lent credence to Ware’s contention, supported by others, that the physical healing is complete, even with the rod and three screws that stay in his right leg. The psychological healing? That is another matter. In his dorm room over the summer, Ware was watching a Team USA basketball scrimmage when Paul George fractured his right leg. Shaken, he texted Georgia State Coach Ron Hunter, “I can’t believe what I just saw.” Within minutes, Ware heard from an assistant coach saying that ESPN was seeking an interview on his reaction. “Oh, brother, here we go again,” Ware remembered thinking. “I was over it at that point. Then it all came back.” Ware acknowledges that he played timidly at practice the next day. Hunter described Ware as awful for a full week leading to a series of scrimmages in Costa Rica. The trip had been designed for the Panthers to deliver shoes to underprivileged youngsters as part of Hunter’s ongoing involvement in the charity Samaritan’s Feet. In the first game, Ware’s leg was clipped, causing a spill. Gasps were heard from the team bench. Hunter thought, “Oh, please, don’t let this be where he gets hurt again — in another country.” But Hunter extended his arm to the team trainer sitting nearby, a signal to wait to see how Ware reacted. The player rose gingerly, then headed upcourt with a relieved smile. The genesis of Ware’s fame was a regional final of the 2013 N.C.A.A. tournament against Duke. Ware’s leg snapped, leaving the bone protruding several inches through skin. He said he saw Coach Rick Pitino’s eyes bulging out in shock. He did not see teammates vomiting and weeping. Networks generally cannot resist showing repeated replays of player injuries as if they are instructional orthopedic videos, but CBS aired it only twice before withholding the clip for the duration of the telecast. Ware told his teammates: “Don’t worry about me. You guys go win this thing.” He explained last week: “I wasn’t worried about myself. All I was worried about was winning that game.” In a hospital bed, he drifted off during halftime. While he slept, phone calls and texts poured in. Michelle Obama reached out, as did LeBron James and Kevin Durant. When Ware awoke, the room was filled with members of his two families, blood and basketball. The best medicine, though, was seeing the regional’s championship trophy, claimed by the Cardinals. In the days that followed, Ware holed up in his residence to avoid attention, becoming friendlier than ever with his PlayStation. A disheartening attempt to blend back into his team ended with a less severe injury after nine games the next season, in which he averaged six minutes. He and Pitino agreed that transferring would be a good idea. Ware had been the first local player scouted by Hunter when he was hired at Georgia State in 2011. On a recruiting visit early this year, the coach told him: “I didn’t get you then. This time, I’m not going to lose you.” At the school of second chances — where he collaborates with R. J. Hunter and Ryan Harrow, a former Kentucky player, in an estimable backcourt — Ware could return to the postseason stage. (The N.C.A.A. waived the transfer rule requiring an athlete to sit out a season, a move he believes was done out of sympathy and a desire to burnish its image.) The Panthers are favored overwhelmingly to represent the Sun Belt Conference. As part of his preparation, Ware sees a sports psychologist provided by the athletics department. The goal is to convert Ware from what Hunter calls “the injured celebrity player” back to his old self. He has hourlong sessions each Friday, discussing mind-over-matter techniques to control sensations like pain. Before the opener, he focused on not overthinking. “I think that really helped me today,” he said after Friday’s game, posing for photos while sprawled on the floor. Ware had pulled on his jersey with the zero, a digit he views as symbolizing a fresh start. As his mother, Lisa Junior, occasionally covered her face from her seat in the sixth row, he maneuvered for 28 minutes mostly with abandon, tumbling a half-dozen times without harm. “A lot of people were scared every time I went down,” Ware said. By his choice, the rod and screws remain, partly as a security blanket. The only discomfort in his leg is mild aching, caused by the metal, when bad weather approaches. In a basketball context, he sees mostly sunny skies ahead.
