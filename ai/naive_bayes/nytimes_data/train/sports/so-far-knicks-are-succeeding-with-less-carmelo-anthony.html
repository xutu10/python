So Far, Knicks Are Succeeding With Less Carmelo Anthony
At 2-1, the Knicks are over .500 for the first time in more than a year, and they have been able to keep Anthony, their top scorer, from playing too many minutes.

GREENBURGH, N.Y. —  For the first time in 369 days, the  For  The Knicks suddenly look and sound like a Norman Vincent Peale self-help manual. “Just the culture, the atmosphere that’s here, the mind-sets of people — and not just the players, but the coaches and the staff,” Anthony said. “How positive everybody is. There’s no bad energy flowing through our team right now.” That was not the case at this time last season, he said. The struggle was real. J. R. Smith was serving a five-game suspension. Chris Smith was collecting a paycheck. Amar’e Stoudemire was grousing about his minutes — the few he got, anyway. And that was before Tyson Chandler broke his right leg in the fourth game of the season. It was apparent by Week 2 that Mike Woodson, then the team’s coach, was holding everything together with duct tape and bubble gum, and then things really got out of hand. The constant losing. The constant questions about Woodson’s job security. The constant speculation over Anthony’s future with the team, which he did little to address. “From Day 1 last year, the energy was just not right,” Anthony said, adding: “It was deeper than us just coming out here and losing basketball games. For whatever reason, it happened. We looked at that, and the organization looked at that, and made some great changes in that direction.” Phil Jackson, the team’s president, made several high-profile changes during the off-season. He fired Woodson and hired Derek Fisher. He also re-signed Anthony while trading Chandler and Raymond Felton to the Dallas Mavericks. Anthony declined to get into specifics, saying: “I’m not talking about no players, man. I’m just talking about as a whole.” Fair enough, because the whole thing was a mess. The toxic psychology of the team manifested itself in ways both seen and unseen, but one of the more obvious examples came in the form of Anthony’s workload, which bounced between backbreaking and soul-crushing. Last season, Anthony averaged 41.3 minutes of playing time through the team’s first three games. It established a trend. He wound up averaging a league-high and career-high 38.7 minutes a game. The team’s offensive system (heavy on isolations) and his style of play (often searching for contact) only aggravated the physical toll. Woodson had an unhealthy dependence on Anthony, and it reeked of desperation. Fisher, who is under no such pressure to win now and win by any means, has taken a more measured approach with Anthony, who is averaging 32.7 minutes a game this season. “In a single night or maybe a month’s span, you may not notice the difference,” Fisher said. “But over the course of an entire season, those six or seven or eight minutes times 100 — in terms of preseason games, regular-season games, playoff games — that all adds up.” After playing 34 minutes against the Cavaliers on Thursday, Anthony played 35 in Sunday’s 96-93 victory over the Hornets. In both games, Anthony made crucial shots down the stretch — an encouraging sign for a player who has often struggled in late-game situations. Against the Cavaliers, Anthony effectively sealed the win with a baseline jumper over LeBron James. And against the Hornets, Anthony provided the go-ahead basket by connecting from the elbow with less than two minutes left. Two big moments. Two big shots. Last season, Anthony shot just 38 percent in the fourth quarters of games (after shooting 47.3 percent through the first three quarters), and it was clear that part of the problem had to do with the physical punishment he was absorbing, which was both cumulative and destructive. By the closing minutes, he was sapped. But this season, he is shooting 54.5 percent in the fourth quarter, going 6 of 11 from the field. While it is too early to know much of anything — one week is an exceedingly small sample size, and almost everyone feels fresh at the start of the season — the extra rest cannot hurt. Anthony said it was too soon to tell whether it would have a lasting effect. “If you ask me that in the middle or toward the end of the season, then my answer might be a little different,” he said. Yet it is also worth noting that the team’s offense has given Anthony cleaner looks at the basket. Fisher’s emphasis on ball movement, a work in progress, appears to have Anthony facing fewer double teams. He is not banging around with 250-pounders in the post all that often. In addition, players like Jason Smith and Iman Shumpert are scoring from the perimeter, which has drawn defenders away from Anthony. It could all still come apart. There are no guarantees, especially for a team with brittle parts and little margin of error. But for now, at least, Anthony said he was glad that nearly everyone was contributing. That alone might be the most important change in a season already full of them. “It’s just a lot different,” Anthony said.
