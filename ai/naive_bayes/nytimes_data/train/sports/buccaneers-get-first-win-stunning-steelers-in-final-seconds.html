Mike Glennon connected with a diving Vincent Jackson on a 5-yard touchdown pass with seven seconds remaining to lift the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a stunning 27-24 win over the host  The Buccaneers (1-3) bounced back after losing to Atlanta by six touchdowns a week earlier. Glennon passed for 302 yards in his first start of the season, including a 41-yard catch-and-run by Louis Murphy that set up Jackson’s score. “We made so many mistakes out there, but we found a way to win,” Tampa Bay Coach Lovie Smith said. “That was a hurdle we needed to get over.” Ben Roethlisberger The Steelers committed 13 penalties for 125 yards. 49ERS 26, EAGLES 21 The 49ers made a late goal-line stand, containing Nick Foles, the N.F.L.’s top passer, as they avoided a three-game losing streak under the fourth-year coach Jim Harbaugh. Foles threw two incomplete passes from the 1 in the waning moments. On a day when the 49ers (2-2) gave up big plays on special teams, Gore came through. Colin Kaepernick threw a touchdown pass to Stevie Johnson, and Phil Dawson kicked four field goals. Darren Sproles had a career-best 82-yard punt return for a touchdown, and Malcom Jenkins returned an interception 53 yards for a score for the Eagles (3-1). Brad Smith recovered a blocked punt for a touchdown. The Eagles had not scored two special-teams touchdowns in one game since 1992. PACKERS 38, BEARS 17 The Packers (2-2) scored on their first six possessions. They racked up 358 yards after being held to 223, their lowest total since 2008, a week earlier in a 19-7 loss at Detroit. They intercepted Jay Cutler twice in the third quarter to pull away from the Bears (2-2). Green Bay has won five consecutive games at Soldier Field, including the N.F.C. title game four years ago and a playoffs-or-bust finale for both teams last season. The offenses were so effective, or the defenses struggled so badly, that neither team punted. That had happened only once before in a regular-season N.F.L. game, a Bills-49ers matchup 22 years ago. COWBOYS 38, SAINTS 17 The Cowboys, who allowed an N.F.L.-record 40 first downs in a 49-17 loss in New Orleans last year, kept Drew Brees and the Saints (1-3) scoreless in the first half. Brees led two scoring drives early in the fourth quarter to cut a 28-point deficit in half before the Cowboys regained control. Dallas is 3-1 under Coach Jason Garrett for the first time. DOLPHINS 38, RAIDERS 14 Tannehill, the subject of attention all week because his coach had declined to confirm him as the starter, took advantage of a depleted Oakland defense to end a two-game losing streak for the Dolphins (2-2). The Raiders (0-4) scored on their opening drive but struggled after that. RAVENS 38, PANTHERS 10 Smith scored twice in the second quarter to help put Baltimore (3-1) in front by 21-7 at halftime. The first touchdown came when Smith grabbed a pass that deflected off the right hand of his teammate Owen Daniels. Smith caught the ball in stride and took it into the end zone to complete a 61-yard play. Carolina (2-2) has lost two straight, both in lopsided fashion against A.F.C. North foes. COLTS 41, TITANS 17 The Colts (2-2) extended their league-leading streak of wins over division rivals to nine. Luck was 29 of 41 for a season-best 393 yards. The Titans (1-3) have lost three straight since an impressive season-opening win over Kansas City. VIKINGS 41, FALCONS 28 Bridgewater, a rookie, was 19 for 30 with no turnovers and ran five times for 27 yards and a score in his first start, but his last carry was costly. His left foot rolled under him as he was sandwiched by two tacklers at the 1-yard line. As Bridgewater was taken away on a cart for X-rays, Christian Ponder took over at quarterback for the Vikings (2-1). The Falcons (2-2) lost three starting offensive linemen to injuries and put tight end Levine Toilolo at right tackle in the fourth quarter. CHARGERS 33, JAGUARS 14 Royal had scoring catches of 47 and 43 yards in his second consecutive two-touchdown game. The Chargers (3-1) extended their winning streak to three. Bortles made his first start for the Jaguars (0-4), threw one touchdown pass, was intercepted twice and twice had Jacksonville in the lead in the first half. TEXANS 23, BILLS 17 Houston (3-1) was trailing by 3 in the third quarter, and Texans quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick had just thrown a second interception. Then the 6-foot-5, 289-pound Watt returned an interception 80 yards to put the Texans ahead by 14-10. Watt, a defensive end, caught a touchdown pass in Week 2, giving him more touchdowns this year than Arian Foster and Andre Johnson combined. Under heavy pressure all afternoon, E J Manuel finished with 225 yards passing with two touchdowns and two interceptions for the Bills (2-2).
