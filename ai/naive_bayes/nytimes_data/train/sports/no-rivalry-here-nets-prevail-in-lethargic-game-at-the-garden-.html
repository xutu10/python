No Rivalry Here: Nets Prevail in Lethargic Game at the Garden 
In a battle between two clubs desperate for a victory — any victory — the Nets dispatched the Knicks in front of a listless sellout crowd at Madison Square Garden.

The win will count, even if the basketball was ugly, even if the arena was generally lifeless, even if the two teams afterward remained flawed and unfinished projects. In a battle between two clubs desperate for a victory — any victory —  The normal narrative of interborough rivalry was set aside this week in acknowledgment of both teams’ deep struggles this season. The Knicks continued to spiral, losing their fifth straight game, dropping their record to 4-15. The Nets improved theirs to 7-9, but they will not be happy with how close they came to giving a game away to such an unimpressive opponent. “We have no choice but to dig out of it,”  The Knicks trailed by as much as 16 points in the game, but Anthony had a chance to tie the score in the dying seconds. With 41 seconds left, Jose Calderon nailed a 15-footer to bring the Knicks within 3. Kevin Garnett missed a layup on the other end, leaving the Knicks an opening. Anthony dribbled to the other end as the clock was ticking down and attempted a pull-up 3-pointer with 9.2 seconds left, but it rattled in and out of the rim. “The shot wasn’t the worst shot,” said Knicks Coach Derek Fisher, who had actually been trying to call a 20-second timeout in that moment. Fisher said the referee had told him later that he did not see him motioning for the timeout. Brook Lopez led all scorers with 23 points, and his teammate Joe Johnson got hot in the second half to contribute 22. Garnett, who finished with 13 rebounds, was the only Nets starter who failed to score in double figures. “Every win for us is a confidence builder,” said Deron Williams, who had 19 points, 5 assists and 5 rebounds. Anthony, in his second game back from a stint battling back spasms, led the Knicks with 20 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists. But he made just one of his nine field-goal attempts in the fourth quarter. His health may be the only consolation to fans of his floundering team. It was not an attractive game. Passes throughout were tossed too long or too short, too often out of reach. Both coaches appeared to try out experimental groupings of players. Both teams’ movements were wooden. One of the few flashes of emotion from the players occurred midway through the third, when Garnett and Amar’e Stoudemire (17 points, 9 rebounds) were issued simultaneous technical fouls when they tussled and argued after a whistle. Things will get harder for both groups: The Nets play the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night, and the Knicks host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday. “This is a big building block for us,” Nets Coach Lionel Hollins said. The teams the Nets have beaten, including the Knicks, started the day with a combined 19-69 record. The Nets entered the game with only two wins since Nov. 12 — one against the depleted Oklahoma City Thunder and another against the winless Philadelphia 76ers. They can add to that list the clueless Knicks. The Knicks are an unabashed work in progress. Fisher, for instance, brushed aside the notion — first floated last month by the team president, Phil Jackson — that there was some date, perhaps Thanksgiving or the start of December, when it would become clear which players could learn and operate within the newly installed triangle offense. “Every day is an opportunity to teach more and learn more about what we’re trying to do offensively and defensively,” Fisher said. The Knicks, on top of everything else, were short-handed on Tuesday, as J. R. Smith sat out with flulike symptoms. With his absence, Stoudemire moved into the starting lineup, forming the 10th different starting group the Knicks have used through 19 games this season. The group may have been different, but the result was the same for the Knicks, who are digging deeper into despair. REBOUNDS It remains unclear when the Knicks will have the services of forward Andrea Bargnani, who has been sidelined since straining his left hamstring in the team’s first preseason game. “Until he practices and is able to sustain the type of output, I don’t think we can measure how close he is,” Derek Fisher said, adding that Bargnani was not expected to practice Wednesday. ... Jeffrey Vanchiro, a well-known Nets season-ticket holder who also goes by the alias Jeffrey Gamblero, caused a minor commotion in the arena — and another one when video surfaced on social media — when he was carried out of the stands by security guards in the third quarter. A Knicks spokesman said arena security personnel had received “multiple complaints from fans sitting in that area. The fan was warned multiple times before being removed. He will not be permitted back into Madison Square Garden.”
