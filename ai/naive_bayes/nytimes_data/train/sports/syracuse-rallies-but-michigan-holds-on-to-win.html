Spike Albrecht rattled in a 3-pointer with 31 seconds left to put Michigan ahead, and the 17th-ranked Wolverines held on to beat visiting Syracuse, 68-65, on Tuesday night in the A.C.C.-Big Ten Challenge. Albrecht’s shot broke a 63-63 tie. Kaleb Joseph of Syracuse, which had rallied from a 10-point second-half deficit, came up short on a 3-point attempt that would have tied the game at the buzzer.
