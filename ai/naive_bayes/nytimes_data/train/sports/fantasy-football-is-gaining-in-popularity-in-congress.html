Fantasy Football Is Gaining in Popularity in Congress
Fantasy football has long been played by congressional staff members, but now their bosses are jumping in with fervor and varying degrees of success

Kevin McCarthy has won five elections to the House of Representatives and the vote to become majority leader, but one loss haunts him: the fantasy football Super Bowl. “This is serious business,” said Mr. McCarthy, a Republican from California. “I came in second last year.” Fantasy football has long been played by congressional staff members, but now their bosses are jumping in with fervor, varying degrees of success and an openness to creating a bipartisan members-only league. The fantasy football playoffs continue this weekend, and Mr. McCarthy will be firing off trash-talk-filled emails and tracking his team’s performance on the ESPN Fantasy Football app after his first-round victory last week. Mr. McCarthy is one of at least two members of the Republican leadership — the other is Tom Rooney, whose family owns a real football team — to join a fantasy league with members of his office. The addition of the bosses has raised the stakes. “Having the leader in the league definitely makes it more competitive,” said Mike Long, the defending league champion and a spokesman for Mr. McCarthy. Standing outside the House chamber last week with hovering aides reminding him of an impending vote, Mr. McCarthy listed his wins over them (“killing it”), brushed away his losses (“even a broken clock is right twice a day”) and nervously hoped that Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson would have a good game this weekend. Mr. McCarthy is not alone in bringing politics’ competitive fervor to fantasy football. The desire to win and the fear of losing bring out the hard knocks in Washington. Mr. Rooney, whose family founded and owns the Pittsburgh Steelers, has lived the highs and, more recently, the lows. After finishing a humbling 7-6 this year, he has accepted the cold reality that “unfortunately the philosophies of the Rooney family, and how we manage a football team, don’t necessarily translate into fantasy football.” Still, he said, “I know I can beat McCarthy.” While Mr. McCarthy is in the playoffs with dreams of ultimate victory — and the bragging rights that go with it — there is the potential for a members-only league next season that would bridge the partisan divide. Mr. McCarthy singled out Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts, a New England Patriots fan, as the Democrat who “doesn’t scare me but would be good competition.” Mr. Kennedy said he was “game.” Although he hung up his virtual cleats in 2012 as he prepared to run for Congress, Mr. Kennedy has played fantasy football for years with his twin brother, Matt. The loser, who was the congressman one year, got his money back in socks full of pennies. “I’m honored that the majority leader would think I’m such a formidable fantasy football juggernaut,” Mr. Kennedy said. Despite kicking off on Capitol Hill, fantasy football has not yet blitzed the Oval Office. Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Obama who has played fantasy football for a decade, said that although many White House staff members played, the president, who “knows a lot about sports and football,” did not. He added that Mr. Obama “could do well” and saw fantasy football or fantasy basketball as a potential “post-presidential activity.” Outside Washington, other politicians are joining the 30 million players who the Fantasy Sports Trade Association says already participate in the game, fueling speculation that the 2016 election will bring about the first fantasy football president. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana plays in two fantasy football leagues, one with his staff and the other with his son’s baseball team. Asked what he thought of the Capitol Hill fantasy leagues, Mr. Jindal, who has expressed interest in running for president, said, “Governors make better presidents, and that rule also applies to fantasy football commissioners.”
