Long Island Boxer Chris Algieri Says He’s Set for Manny Pacquiao
Algieri, a 30-year-old former kickboxer who once pondered retirement, will face Pacquiao, the holder of multiple world titles, on Saturday.

Chris Algieri’s rise from unknown boxer to a champion worthy of fighting the superstar  Algieri, a native of Huntington, N.Y., who is undefeated through 20 fights, watched the Russian heavyweight Magomed Abdusalamov absorb 312 punches when Mike Perez hammered out a 10-round unanimous decision against him on Nov. 2, 2013, at Madison Square Garden. Abdusalamov had emergency surgery at Roosevelt Hospital to remove a blood clot on his brain, and he was placed in a medically induced coma. The outcome of that fight led Algieri to seriously consider retirement. “That struck home with me that this is a dangerous sport,” he said. “This man may not wake up.” Abdusalamov, 33, a married father of three, left the hospital more than 10 months later, paralyzed on his right side and unable to speak. Algieri was so shaken by the fight that he sought an urgent meeting with his promoter, Joe DeGuardia. Algieri, 30, has a bachelor’s degree in health science from Stony Brook University and a master’s degree in clinical nutrition from the New York Institute of Technology. He thought it might be time to apply those degrees. “I was making what I felt were lateral moves,” Algieri said. “I wasn’t making any money to speak of. I was training like a champion, but I wasn’t getting the recognition or getting paid like one. It was making less and less sense for me to stick around.” DeGuardia said he had been unusually careful in selecting opponents for Algieri because Algieri did not have any amateur experience as a boxer. Instead, his background was that of a champion kickboxer. Algieri did not leave kickboxing for the greater earning potential that boxing offered until 2008. “It’s almost like making a fire,” DeGuardia said of grooming a boxer. “You have to be careful not to smother it, and you have to give it breathing room. It’s a process.” Algieri eventually pressured DeGuardia into allowing him to face the heavy hitter Emanuel Taylor. Algieri, who has only eight knockouts and is more of an artist than a slugger, responded to the significant upgrade in competition by outpointing Taylor over 10 rounds before a hometown crowd at the Paramount Theater on Long Island on Feb. 14. That victory landed Algieri  At first, it appeared that Algieri would fall victim to his own ambition. Provodnikov dominated early, scoring two knockdowns in the opening round and landing a vicious blow that caused Algieri’s right eye to swell until he lost all vision in it by the 12th and final round. But the contest soon turned into a showcase for Algieri’s confidence, determination and ring savvy. “You don’t have to have a tough upbringing to be tough,” Algieri said. “I think that was a big question people had about me, coming from Long Island and being educated. But my drive comes from my passion for the sport and for competition. I like to compete. I like to win.” Algieri, imploring an attending physician to allow him to continue despite increasing concern about his damaged eye, went on to gain an upset by a split decision. That positioned him to challenge Pacquiao (56-5-2), the World Boxing Organization’s welterweight champion, for a payday in excess of $1 million that perhaps only he and those close to him ever dreamed possible. “I’m not surprised, because I know my son, his determination, his goals, his focus,” Algieri’s mother, Adriana, said. “What I do appreciate is the fact that circumstances, luck, whatever you want to call it, he has the opportunity to fight a living legend, as he calls him — Manny Pacquiao. “A lot of things came together for him to be able to do this at this time,” she said. “We know a lot of boxers out there who would love to be in Chris’s shoes.” Algieri continues to face long odds. Freddie Roach, Pacquiao’s trainer, has suggested that the sparring partners Pacquiao is using are more formidable than his upstart opponent. Pacquiao, 35, who has won world titles in a record eight weight classes during his illustrious career, may even be looking beyond the fight as he speaks of his desire to land a bout against the undefeated superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. To begin his work for Pacquiao, Algieri remained in familiar surroundings, the Bellmore Kickboxing Club in Bellmore, N.Y. His most strenuous preparation occurred during an ensuing four-and-a-half week stay in Las Vegas. He took a little less than two weeks to acclimate himself to Macau, an autonomous region of China. Algieri’s emphasis has been on finding ways to counter his opponent’s tremendously fast hands. “This is a rhythm sport; timing is everything,” he said. “Using my timing and rhythm to offset his speed and experience is really the key.” Pacquiao has recently shown signs of vulnerability. He split his last four fights and has not recorded a knockout in his last nine bouts. Algieri remains intensely focused, unchanged by his new celebrity. He used the $100,000 he earned against Provodnikov to satisfy  His confidence continues to soar. At 5 feet 10 inches, he is three and a half inches taller than the far more battle-tested Pacquiao, with a five-inch advantage in reach. “I go in with the conviction that I am going to win this,” he said. “I’m going to beat Manny Pacquiao, no disrespect to him or anyone else. That’s just how I feel.” Algieri will be joined in Macau by his parents and many members of his tight-knit family. His mother never attends his fights. Her moment with her son will come before he leaves for the arena. They will join hands to say their usual prayer, asking that both fighters avoid lasting harm.
