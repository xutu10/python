Dion Waiters Plays a Fluctuating Role in Cleveland
At first distracted by his move to the bench, Cleveland guard Dion Waiters came on to score 21 points in a victory over formidable Memphis.

CLEVELAND —  The prevailing feeling here about the city’s professional basketball team seems to fall somewhere between guarded optimism and cautious enthusiasm. The  But for any continuing struggles with chemistry and rotations and ego management, the Cavaliers still employ someone who is capable of rising above it all.  He can also prod young teammates, nudging them along until they (potentially) become a part of the whole. Enter Dion Waiters, whose role with the new-look Cavaliers has fluctuated this season — along with his attitude. He started the first three games of the season, shot 33 percent from the field and was consigned to coming off the bench. On Sunday afternoon, though, Waiters had more than a cameo in the Cavaliers’ 105-91 victory over the  It was a playful jab — James said, in so many words, that Waiters had yet to prove anything — but James reiterated the message a few minutes later. “We know Dion’s capable of playing some really good isolation basketball,” James said. “But at the same time, we have to do what’s best for the team. So it’s a fine line.” The Cavaliers (16-10) are one of the league’s most fascinating teams: brimming with talent but still trying to find ways to make all the pieces fit. They are showing signs of progress, and their convincing win over the Grizzlies — although one that came with an asterisk, given Zach Randolph’s absence with a sore knee — was their 11th victory in 14 games. “I don’t think the game was as close as the score indicates,” said Grizzlies Coach David Joerger, whose team trailed for the duration. “I think they played loose and free.” It was not outside the realm of possibility to imagine the game as a finals preview. Despite having lost their past two games, the Grizzlies (21-6) are off to their best start in franchise history, and the Cavaliers are one of several teams that could emerge from the Eastern Conference. But David Blatt, the Cavaliers’ coach, was quick to dismiss the notion that his team had made a statement. “I don’t judge where we stand in the league by one game,” he said. More important to Blatt was the improved production of his bench (37 points), his team’s selfless play in the halfcourt (34 assists on 46 field goals) and an angst-free effort from Waiters, who had required some “discussing and cajoling and convincing” when his minutes were cut earlier in the season, Blatt said. Again, one game means little within the broad scope of the season. But with Waiters, a shooting guard in his third season out of Syracuse, Blatt seemed more than willing to highlight the positives. He can only hope they last. “I was really happy,” Blatt said, “and believe me, it had very little to do with the points that he scored. When he’s engaged and when he’s playing freely and when he’s not allowing himself to be disturbed by other things, then Dion can really play basketball.” James, who had 25 points and 11 assists, was on the receiving end of an alley-oop pass from Waiters that pushed the lead to 11 early in the fourth quarter. The Grizzlies were gasping for air, and when James returned the favor later in the quarter by shoveling a pass to Waiters for an open 3-pointer, the lead had expanded to 17. James has sought to counsel Waiters, advising him to calm down, to eliminate the distractions, to buy into the concept of team basketball. Waiters played with poise against the Grizzlies until one possession late in the fourth quarter, when he decided to launch a turnaround jumper from 17 feet with defenders draped all over him. It was an air ball. “Dion played a great game,” James said, “besides that last shot he took.” James laughed. “He tried it,” he added. “He tried it.” But for all the drama, Waiters has abilities that the Cavaliers could use consistently: scoring and energy, especially off the bench, if he fully accepts the role. “He has talent,” James said. “A very talented kid. Plays the game very aggressively, and we always appreciate that. I just think he continues to learn the game — and that goes for all the guys. Every experience that we have, every time we have an opportunity to go out there and play, we learn from it.”
