Fantasy Football: Week 7 Waiver Wire Picks

With quite a few breakout performances (and more injuries) this past weekend, there are still some good waiver options left, considering we’re heading into Week 7. These are not players you’ll want to spend your entire FAAB budget (or even a No. 1 waiver priority on), but there are some able fill-ins available in most leagues. Note: These suggestions are for 10-12 team leagues and every player listed below is owned in less than 50 percent of most leagues. Quarterback Joe Flacco (BAL) –  Flacco is readily available on over 60 percent of waiver wires and he gets to face the woeful Falcons defense this week. I don’t expect Flacco to finish as a top 10 (dare I say, “elite”) quarterback, but the fact is he’s thrown for more touchdown passes than any quarterback not named Andrew Luck, Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Jay Cutler or Philip Rivers? Carson Palmer Two games is a small sample size, but Palmer is averaging 19 fantasy points per game this season and Michael Floyd and Larry Fitzgerald are still one of the better wide receiver tandems in the league. With matchups against the Raiders, Eagles and Cowboys in his near future, Palmer is a no-brainer, short-term pickup for me this week. Digging Deeper: Austin Davis (STL), Blake Bortles (JAC), Ryan Tannehill (MIA), Brian Hoyer (CLE) Running Back Isaiah Crowell (CLE) --  Tate looked great against the Steelers this week (and his 42 snaps were more than double those of Crowell’s 11), but Crowell’s .45 fantasy points per snap ( You may have to wait a couple weeks for Crowell to become relevant, but he’s a strong runner on a team that wants to commit to running the ball. New England Running Backs --  We could see Bolden mixed in with Shane Vereen going forward, but we could just as well see James White inserted into the lineup, Jonas Gray promoted from the practice squad, or someone like BenJarvus Green-Ellis signed off the street. If I’m picking up anyone in the Patriots’ backfield besides Vereen, it’s Bolden. But just make sure you remember which team we’re dealing with before you go all-in on a top waiver claim. Digging Deeper: Ronnie Hillman (DEN), Jerrick McKinnon (MIN), Storm Johnson (JAC), Antone Smith (ATL) Wide Receiver Mohammed Sanu (CIN) --  Coming off a big Week 6 performance, Sanu is primed for another big week with A.J. Green unlikely to play and Marvin Jones facing surgery. Sanu isn’t a Julio Jones-type, big-play threat (as evidenced by his 10.3 average depth of target over the past two weeks), but he’s making the most of his opportunity. Over the first six weeks, Sanu ranks eighth in terms of fantasy points per route run among receivers who have played more than 50 percent of their team’s snaps. With or without A.J. Green, that’s someone who you want on your fantasy team. Odell Beckham Jr. (NYG) –  In just his second N.F.L. game, Beckham was on the field for 60 of the Giants’ 68 snaps and though he didn’t do much with his three targets, he’ll have plenty of opportunity to produce going forward. I’d prioritize Sanu over Beckham in my waiver pickups this week, but his ownership percentage should skyrocket from 8 percent to well above 50 percent after this week. Digging Deeper: Andre Holmes (OAK), Allen Robinson (JAC), Malcom Floyd (SD), Davante Adams (ATL) Tight End Travis Kelce (KC) --  Jared Cook (STL) --  The bad news is that Cook hasn’t been doing a whole lot with his targets (he only has 19.8 fantasy points in P.P.R. leagues over the last two weeks), but targets generally lead to good things and the tight end waiver wire is close to barren right now. Digging Deeper: Jace Amaro (NYJ), Dwayne Allen (IND), Charles Clay (MIA), Tim Wright (NE) Defense/Special Teams Cleveland Browns --  Nick Raducanu is the founder of
