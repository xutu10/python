Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw to Pitch Game 4 on Short Rest
Dodgers Manager Don Mattingly passed over Dan Haren despite Kershaw’s failure to protect a big lead against the Cardinals in losing Game 1 of a National League division series.

ST. LOUIS —  Clayton Kershaw will not have long to stew about his forgettable performance in Game 1 of the division series against the  Dodgers “He’s our guy,” Mattingly said. “Obviously it’s not something we would even think about doing over the course of the season, really. But this is a different time.” Mattingly opted for Kershaw over the veteran Dan Haren, despite Kershaw’s disastrous Game 1 last Friday. Staked to a 6-1 lead, Kershaw imploded, surrendering six runs in the seventh inning. His final line: eight runs in six and two-thirds innings. And for all Kershaw’s dominance — he has led the major leagues in earned run average four straight years and is a two-time Cy Young winner (and a prohibitive favorite to add a third after this season) — he remains reliably vulnerable to the Cardinals’ attack. During last year’s National League Championship Series, St. Louis beat him twice, producing a seven-run outburst in the clinching Game 6. During the regular season, Kershaw allowed more than three runs only once in 27 starts. Game 1 was such a departure that some wondered whether the Cardinals had stolen signs or whether he was tipping pitches. Kershaw said Monday that he had not watched tape of the game and that he did not learn anything new about the Cardinals. “Obviously, after as bad as I pitched in Game 1 I wasn’t going to go in there and say, ‘I want the ball,’ ” Kershaw said. “I was definitely ready for it and definitely wanted to do it, just waiting for the opportunity.” Added Mattingly: “You don’t get to where you are — you don’t win four E.R.A. titles, and it’s going to end up three out of the last four Cy Youngs — just by when anything goes bad, you curl up and go away. These guys go to work; they come back. They keep working, and they keep going. So this is a different cat.” Mattingly hopes Kershaw can duplicate last year’s winning script, when he ace started Game 4 of the division series against the Atlanta Braves on three days’ rest. Kershaw won Game 1 against Atlanta and then helped Los Angeles clinch the series when he allowed only two unearned runs in six innings three days later. “We felt like last year he did good against Atlanta,” Mattingly said. “He bounced back. He didn’t have any problems.” The Cardinals, at this point, will not counter with their ace, Adam Wainwright. St. Louis Manager Mike Matheny will stick with the 23-year old Shelby Miller, who posted a 10-9 record with a 3.74 this season. Miller has never started a postseason game. “He’s using his off-speed pitches in tough counts,” Matheny said of Miller. “He’s got a curveball he never had before. He’s putting movement on his fastball he’s never had before. He’s learning to be more efficient. He’s just got more weapons, which keeps them off balance. And that’s the essence of pitching.” For Game 3, Mattingly sent the South Korean left-hander Hyun-jin Ryu to the mound. Ryu had thrown just one inning in the last month, when he started against the San Francisco Giants on Sept, 12 and left with shoulder irritation. Ryu missed three weeks in April and May with the same injury, but returned after 23 days off and beat the Mets. Without the benefit of a rehabilitation start, he threw 89 pitches and allowed two runs in six innings. “He’s thrown plenty in between,” Mattingly said. “It’s not like a guy coming out of spring training.” If the Dodgers win one of the next two games, they will have the former Cy Young winner Zack Greinke ready for Game 5.
