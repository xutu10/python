Devils Fall to Flyers; Blackhawks Win Eighth Straight Game but Lose Jonathan Toews
The Devils lost their second in a row while the Blackhawks lost their No. 2 scorer.
===
Matt Read and Sean Couturier each had a goal and an assist to lead the  Wayne Simmonds added a power-play goal for the Flyers, and Jakub Voracek scored in an empty net late in the third period to seal the win. Martin Havlat scored for the Devils. The win opened a four-game homestand for the Flyers, who had dropped four of their last five on the road. Three of the four losses were by one goal. The Flyers have dropped to the bottom portion of the Eastern Conference and need to make the most of their coming home games to jump back into the playoff race. They got an unexpected lift from Read, who has only three goals and seven assists in 28 games. He had one of each in the first period, giving the Flyers a lead they did not relinquish. The Devils have lost two straight. With Steve Mason 0-5 against the Devils, Ray Emery started for the Flyers. Emery was 0-4 with a 4.12 goals against average in his last four starts. But he was hardly tested against the Devils and earned his fifth win of the season, matching Mason’s total in eight fewer games. After missing two games with a strained gluteus muscle, Mike Cammalleri, the Devils’ leading scorer, returned but could not propel the team. With the Devils down a player early in the first, Couturier scored his sixth goal for Philadelphia’s first short-handed goal of the season. BLACKHAWKS The Blackhawks lost their captain and No. 2 scorer, Jonathan Toews, in the second period when Dennis Seidenberg hit him from behind and sent him face-first into the boards. No further information about the injury was available. Scott Darling made 32 saves for the Blackhawks, who have won 11 of their last 12 games and lost just twice in the past month. Tuukka Rask stopped 18 shots for Boston. The Bruins have lost four of their last five games and six of eight. SABRES 4, FLAMES 3  Zemgus Girgensons and Marcus Foligno also scored for the Sabres, while Tyler Ennis had three assists. Moulson’s second goal of the game, on a pass from Ennis with 7 minutes 29 seconds to go, broke a 3-3 tie and gave the Sabres their second straight win. Mark Giordano, Sean Monahan and David Jones scored for Calgary, which outshot Buffalo, 45-19. The Sabres have won four straight at home. Monahan scored on a rebound at 3:14 of the third to give the Flames a 3-2 lead. Girgensons then tied the game when he took a pass through the crease from Ennis and shot into an open net at 7:59. BLUE JACKETS 3, CAPITALS 2 With Jason Chimera in the penalty box for interference, Foligno put a slap shot from the right circle past goalie Braden Holtby to give the Blue Jackets their only lead of the game. It was Foligno’s second goal of the game and his 13th of the season, a team high. Washington finished with a 41-23 advantage in shots, but Bobrovsky was the equalizer. Eric Fehr and Troy Brouwer had goals for the Capitals, whose three-game winning streak ended. LIGHTNING 2, HURRICANES 1  Kucherov scored the winner when his pass went off Carolina defenseman Ron Hainsey and into the net with 30.3 seconds to play. The Lightning backup Evgeni Nabokov made 29 saves. Justin Faulk scored for the Hurricanes, who have scored four goals during a four-game losing streak. Cam Ward stopped 25 shots. KINGS 5, SENATORS 3  Cameron was promoted by Ottawa on Monday, after Paul MacLean was fired. Matt Greene, Justin Williams, Anze Kopitar and Tanner Pearson also scored for the Kings. Jake Muzzin had three assists, and Jonathan Quick made 32 saves. Bobby Ryan, Mark Stone and Jared Cowen scored for the Senators. Trailing by 2-1, the Senators got off to a solid start in the third period to tie the game, but in less than two minutes the Kings regained a two-goal lead.
