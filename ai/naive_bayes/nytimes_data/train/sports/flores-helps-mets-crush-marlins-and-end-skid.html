Flores, 23, hit a three-run shot in the fifth and a two-run drive in the seventh, just hours after Commissioner Bud Selig said he was impressed with the manner in which the Mets were rebuilding. Flores also had a run-scoring double in the fourth. The Mets had their highest run total at home since they tallied 11 against the Philadelphia Phillies on July 30. Having slowly developed the power stroke the organization thinks he is capable of, Flores is 8 for 15 with three homers and 10 runs batted in over his last four games. He has six home runs over all. “Maybe it takes a little more time for some people,” Flores said of finding his swing against big leaguers. “I’m seeing the ball well right now.” Bartolo Colon “I was able to execute at the right moment to get out of the big inning,” Colon, who struck out seven without a walk, said through an interpreter. Curtis Granderson had a run-scoring single among his three hits, and the Mets handed Nathan Eovaldi (6-12) his sixth straight losing decision over seven starts, dating to Aug. 13. Eovaldi yielded six runs and six hits over four and a third innings.
