Shortly after Francisco Cervelli signed with the  When Jeter retired in September, Cervelli became the longest-serving player in the Yankees organization. It was a title he held for barely six weeks. He was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday for the left-handed relief pitcher Justin Wilson.   Cervelli had fallen out of favor with the Yankees and Manager Joe Girardi, and John Ryan Murphy emerged as a viable alternative. Murphy, who becomes the presumptive backup for Brian McCann, is a cheaper alternative whom the Yankees see as a better defensive catcher and game-caller than Cervelli.  Wilson, 27, was a starter in the minor leagues but was converted to the bullpen in the majors, where he has compiled a 2.99 earned run average in 136 games over three seasons. He has been slightly more effective against right-handed hitters than against lefties. Cervelli made his major league debut on Sept. 18, 2008, and has a career .278 batting average in 250 games. The longest-serving Yankee is now Alex Rodriguez, who joined the team in 2004.
