Amid Turmoil, Michigan Seeks to Balance Athletics and Academics 
Michigan must beat its biggest rival, Ohio State, on Saturday to become eligible to play in a bowl game, but the troubled program faces bigger challenges as the university’s sports culture is questioned.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Michigan football has had unsuccessful seasons in its storied history, but maybe none have been as disastrous as this one. A quarterback who appeared to have  The wait list for tickets is gone, and the streak of having more than 100,000 people at every game since 1975 nearly came to an end. The Wolverines are 5-6 under the embattled coach Brady Hoke and must beat its biggest rival, Ohio State, on Saturday to become eligible to play in a bowl game. Michigan, once the class of the college football landscape, suddenly embodies the struggle between athletics and academics playing out at universities throughout the country. Michigan’s new president, Mark Schlissel, has suggested that academics may have taken a back seat in the athletic department and made it clear that the university’s sports culture concerned him. Now he must remake Michigan at a time when the combination of big-time college sports and a scandal-free reputation is an elusive proposition. “We have to get this right,” said Mark Bernstein, a university regent. “I believe the stakes at this university are unusually high in the sense that this university aspires to be exceptional academically and with respect to athletics. If those two worlds can coexist without comprising the integrity and values of the university — that’s our goal. If they can’t coexist, then intercollegiate athletics is truly an illusion.” Schlissel, a former provost at Brown University and a scientist, expressed concern to a faculty group recently that Michigan, annually ranked among the top-rated public universities in the nation and owners of the most victories in college football history, had admitted football players that were not as academically qualified as the rest of the student body. “The incentives are really strong for them to be as successful on the field as possible, and some of those are in dollars and others are in performance,” said Schlissel, according to the student newspaper,  Schlissel named Jim Hackett, an alumnus with an accomplished corporate background, as the interim athletic director. At the end of the season, Hackett must decide whether to keep or fire Hoke. When Dave Brandon, a former Michigan regent and Domino’s chief executive, became athletic director in 2010, he emphasized promoting Michigan’s brand and generating ancillary revenue streams. He increased ticket prices, even as the team underperformed. Referencing the title of a business book, he often told his staff: “If it ain’t broke, break it.” Brandon, who did not return multiple messages seeking comment, also meddled with tradition. On his watch, Michigan Stadium played piped-in music; the football team wore outlandish alternate uniforms; and a handful of retired jerseys were un-retired, given out and designated as “Legend” jerseys in an attempt to market the university’s past. He changed the student seating policy at football games to get students to arrive on time. He also raised their ticket prices. In October, hundreds of students marched to the president’s home on campus, chanting for Brandon’s dismissal. Michigan fans do not readily welcome change. They even have a name for one of their own: a Michigan Man. In 1989, Bo Schembechler, the legendary football coach turned athletic director, refused to let a basketball coach finish the season after the coach decided to leave for another job. “A Michigan Man will coach Michigan,” Schembechler famously said. Brandon was considered one: He played football for Schembechler. He had no experience in athletic administration — but neither had his four predecessors. Hackett, the interim director, was an accomplished executive at Steelcase, an office furniture company, and, as a teammate of Brandon’s, a Michigan man. But he, too, has no experience in athletics administration, and it is unclear if he wants the job on a permanent basis. Rick Bay, a Michigan alumnus and former Michigan wrestling coach, said that it was important for Michigan to hire a more traditional athletic director. “I’d like to see somebody who has established himself or herself in the profession and is experienced,” said Bay, who has been an athletic director at four Division I schools, most recently San Diego State. E. Gordon Gee, the president of West Virginia University, agreed that a seasoned athletic administrator would not only improve the bottom line and performance on the field but also improve communications. “It requires a very able leader, someone that understands the ramifications of intercollegiate athletics,” Gee said, adding, “It also requires someone who can inspire people, coaches and others. And the third thing, it requires someone who can inspire the university and explain the role of athletics within the university.” When Gee was president at Ohio State, he was asked if he would fire the football coach Jim Tressel, who had come under fire for an N.C.A.A. investigation into violations involving his players. “I’m just hoping that the coach doesn’t dismiss me,” he said, a quip that landed him in hot water. Gee said he learned firsthand about the dangers of having a powerful and too isolated athletic department. Schlissel, who later apologized to Hoke for his remarks to the faculty group, declined to comment on his concerns or his future plans. Schlissel is trusting Hackett to decide Hoke’s fate, but he will surely play a role in deciding the future of Wolverines football. It is a prospect that makes many in the Michigan universe nervous. “I’m amazed that the regents would hire a president with so little grounding in intercollegiate athletics, so little understanding of it,” Bay said. “I have sympathy for the man, that he’s been put in a position where he has to deal with a major part of the university and has no experience. He’s never been in a culture like this.” When he was hired, Hoke was thought to be the quintessential Michigan Man. He coached under Lloyd Carr, who went 122-40 from 1995 to 2007 and learned from Schembechler, who died in 2006. His tenure, however, has not been as successful as his predecessors’. In his first season in 2011, the Wolverines went 11-2 and won the Sugar Bowl. Since then, Hoke is 20-17, including a 2-6 record against Ohio State, Michigan State and Notre Dame. “Look, we’re the winningest program in college football,” Hoke said. “We know the expectations.” Hoke has not campaigned to keep his job. He also has remained stoic throughout the off-field turmoil. “If we were in the mix for the national championship, how would that change the conversation?” asked Steve Grafton, the president of the alumni association. Hoke has his supporters, but he will most likely be fired shortly after the season when a new athletic director could be named to pursue the new president’s agenda for athletics. The only thing that is clear is that the stakes are high. “If this university can’t get this right,” Bernstein, the regent, said “then no university can.”
