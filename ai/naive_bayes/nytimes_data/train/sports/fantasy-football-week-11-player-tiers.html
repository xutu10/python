Fantasy Football: Week 11 Player Tiers
Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger disappointed fantasy owners last week and falls to Tier 3 against the Titans this week.
===
In this statistical model, I apply a clustering algorithm called  Quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger disappointed owners last week and falls to Tier 3 against the Titans this week. Robert Griffin III joins him in Tier 3 with a nice matchup against Tampa Bay in his second game back. Many experts predicted a good game from Mark Sanchez with his first start with the Eagles, and he came through with 322 passing yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. Sanchez joins Jay Cutler and Russell Wilson in Tier 4. There is a significant dropoff to Josh McCown and Ryan Tannehill in Tier 5. Don’t expect solid production from anyone in this tier or lower. Running Back The brutal bye weeks are over, so around 20 solid running backs are available. You can expect the top three tiers, ranging from Matt Forte (Tier 1) to Shane Vereen (Tier 3), to see heavy volume. The Tier 4 options are less appealing. Terrance West looks to be the hot hand in Cleveland but no one is sure how that backfield will play out; Steven Jackson has a two-game touchdown streak but failed to reach 25 rushing yards in each of the two games before that; Jerick McKinnon is unlikely to get goal-line carries behind Matt Asiata and there are no workload guarantees for Ryan Mathews or Rashad Jennings, both of whom are returning this week from multi-week injuries. C.J. Anderson is another interesting name in this tier. He’s currently the hot hand in Denver, but Montee Ball is finally healthy again and should mix in. Also, keep an eye on the status of Giovani Bernard. Wide Receiver Calvin Johnson came back from his five-week injury with seven catches for 113 yards and one touchdown. He returns to the top tier of wide receivers, alongside Demaryius Thomas, Jordy Nelson and Antonio Brown. Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshal fall to Tier 3 as a result of the Bears’ lack of offensive cohesiveness against the Packers. Odell Beckham Jr. has now torched Dallas, Indianapolis and Seattle in his last three games and has risen to Tier 3. The worst options in Tier 4 are Brandon LaFell, who has been dropping passes, DeAndre Hopkins, who could see a lot of the top Browns cornerback Joe Haden this week and Martavis Bryant, who is still getting about half the snaps rotating as the WR2 in Pittsburgh. Tight End The tight end position has been quite barren. Outside the top tier of Rob Gronkowski, Jimmy Graham and Julius Thomas, there are no guarantees of a reasonable floor. Very little separates Tiers 2, 3 and 4 this week. No one in these middle tiers is consistently racking up receiving yards, so we’re left to guess who is most likely to score touchdowns. Mychal Rivera and Charles Clay are slightly better options than Jared Cook and Delanie Walker in Tier 4, according to expert consensus. In Tier 5, Kyle Rudolph and Jordan Cameron have the highest stash appeal for later weeks as both are coming back from long injuries.
