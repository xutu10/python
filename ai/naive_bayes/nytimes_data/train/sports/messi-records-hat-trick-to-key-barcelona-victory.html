Aston Villa rallied to beat last-place Leicester, 2-1, and moved into 11th place. ■ In Serie A, Napoli rallied from two goals down for a 2-2 draw at home against Empoli, while Genoa beat visiting AC Milan, 1-0, to move into third place. Udinese rallied to win, 2-1, at Inter Milan on goals by Bruno Fernandes and Cyril Thereau. ■ In the Bundesliga, host Hamburg took advantage of Mainz’s mistakes to win, 2-1, and give itself some breathing space in the fight against relegation, while Alexander Meier scored twice to lead Eintracht Frankfurt past visiting Werder Bremen, 5-2, for his team’s third consecutive victory. ■ In Ligue 1, host Marseille restored its 1-point lead over Paris Saint-Germain by defeating Metz, 3-1, on goals by André-Pierre Gignac in the 43rd minute, Andre Ayew in the 59th and Dimitri Payet in stoppage time.
