The N.B.A. on Wednesday suspended Knicks guard J. R. Smith for one game without pay for striking Glen Rice Jr. in the groin late in the Knicks’ loss to the Washington Wizards on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden. Smith will miss the Knicks’ game Wednesday night against the Detroit Pistons in Auburn Hills, Mich. Smith, who is no stranger to the league’s disciplinary policies,  Smith, who has come off the bench in all four of the team’s games this season, has struggled to adapt to Coach Derek Fisher’s triangle offense. He is averaging a career-low 7.5 points while shooting 38.7 percent. He had 6 points in 24 minutes against the Wizards. Smith ran afoul of the league (and the team) several times last season. He was suspended for the first five games of the season for violating the N.B.A.'s antidrug policy. Then, last November, he was fined $25,000 for sending what the league considered a hostile message on social media to the Pistons’ Brandon Jennings. In January, the league fined him $50,000 for repeatedly untying opponents’ shoelaces.
