The  Forward Brandon Sutter tested negative. All three players missed Pittsburgh’s two-game trip through Florida after showing signs of the illness. ■ Jack Eichel and Chase DeLeo scored in a shootout to help the United States beat the defending champion, Finland, 2-1, in a round-robin opener in the World Junior Championship in Montreal. Eichel is a freshman at Boston University, and DeLeo plays for Portland in the Western Hockey League.

Kennedy, who was sexually abused by his junior hockey coach in the 1980s, was admitted to the Order of Canada. He played for the Red Wings, the Flames and the Bruins between 1989 and 1997.  (AP)
