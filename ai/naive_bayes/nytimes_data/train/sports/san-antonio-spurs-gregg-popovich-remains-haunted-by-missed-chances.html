After Five Titles With San Antonio Spurs, Gregg Popovich Remains Haunted by Missed Chances
Since Tim Duncan joined Coach Gregg Popovich in San Antonio, the Spurs have been contenders or champions every season. Still, missed opportunities — the 2013 finals, in particular — haunt Popovich.

Roughly five months later, the memory of the moment is a little fuzzy, somewhat faded. Gregg Popovich had to be reminded that he actually sat out the initial celebration, and was stationed on the sideline, watching his  Or maybe he wasn’t really watching because his face had a strange faraway look, reflecting no joy because — if he was certain about anything, it was the essence of his emotions — it was all about relief. “No euphoria, nothing like that, just relief,” he said. Lost on Popovich, the veteran coach of the now five-time champion Spurs, was the sheer dominance his team displayed against  But stuff happens. The Spurs’ revolution overthrowing King James was televised. Within days, Joe Torre had weighed in with a congratulatory note. Then Bill Bradley called to tell Popovich that Tim Duncan and friends had reminded him of his old  “You say to yourself, something special must have really happened,” Popovich said before heading to Brooklyn for Wednesday night’s game against the Nets at Barclays Center. “I should know this. I was there; I should have noticed.” He had walked over to talk after a morning shootaround at Baruch College in Manhattan, where the security guard at the entrance two flights up from the gymnasium stared blankly at a reporter who said he was there for the Spurs’ practice. Nothing on the schedule, he said. Hadn’t seen any tall people pass through. Of course he hadn’t. The stealth Spurs, who revel in their small-market hideaway city and relish their lack of news-making histrionics, had ducked through a back door. Respect and admiration for this model franchise has never been higher, but the Spurs will still never be the Beatles. They drew only 12,843 fans on Monday in Philadelphia, where fans had a fine opportunity to see, in addition to an actual N.B.A. team, one for the ages. Small sample size notwithstanding, 22 teams have drawn larger average crowds on the road this season than the Spurs, including the 76ers. The Spurs are scheduled to play 25 times this season on national television — not bad, but, taken contextually, not worthy of their greatness considering Kobe Bryant and his pitiful Los Angeles Lakers have 28 dates and the 4-15 Knicks are slotted for 23. Popovich cares nothing about N.B.A. ratings, only about the five rings and what he saw when he finally sat down over the summer with a clearer and more objective mind to watch what Bradley and Torre had raved about. “I looked at the film and said, my gosh,” he said. “I don’t know if we can get to the level we played those last three games in Miami.” Of the call from Bradley, who is six years older than the 65-year-old Popovich, he said: “I was speechless. He was a hero.” The comparisons to the 1970s Knicks are nothing new, at least not under this byline. But Red Holzman’s teams won two titles and had a six-year run as an elite team. Since Duncan partnered with Popovich in 1997, the Spurs have been contenders or champions for 17 years, and have won it all in three different decades. Or look at it this way: James, who was to follow the Spurs into New York to play the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Thursday night, is in his 12th N.B.A. season. When Duncan won his first title in 1999, James was an eighth-grader. When the Spurs won a fourth, they swept James and his Cavaliers during the King’s first tour in Cleveland. Seven years later, they took him down in Miami. Who would insist the Spurs couldn’t lay waste to James and his new band of Cavalier brothers should they meet up again next June? His team’s longevity occasionally astounds Popovich, perhaps most when he is inspired by a good wine. “Like last night, we had the night off and we go to dinner and just look at each other and go, my gosh, this has happened to us, and it’s never going to happen to any of us again, no matter where any of us go,” he said. It was a coaches’ night out, apart from the team. Players are not too philosophical, Popovich said, except in the case of his core oldies. “I guarantee you that Timmy cherishes every practice, every day,” he said. “Maybe it’s his last year, who knows?” Maybe the Spurs have never been sexy enough to sell outside San Antonio because they can’t be reduced to a sound bite. On one hand, they are new age, with the richest N.B.A. blend of international cultures, a female assistant coach in Becky Hammon and an Italian assistant in Ettore Messina. But they are also old school in that they have retained their core talent in a way that predates free agency, back to when players had no choice, back to when Red Auerbach, the Boston patriarch, would respond to a player’s plea for a raise by asking, “How would you like a trade to Cincinnati?” “All these guys, the core guys, they’ve made less money in San Antonio than counterparts all across the league — people who will say they gave up that, they gave up this,” Popovich said. “But these guys have given up real money with every new contract to stay together. These guys care about quality of life, and it falls into the way they play.” They let down their guard in the closing seconds of Game 6 against the Heat two years ago, gave up a pair of offensive rebounds, 3-point shots and a 6-point lead, and lost the title under the most devastating circumstances. There wasn’t a day last season that Popovich wasn’t haunted by it, he said. When did he finally let it go? “I’ve just sort of begun to do so, to be honest with you,” he said. One would have thought the aftertaste of the 2013 finals would have been swept away by the Spurs’ Game 5 clinching in 2014. But listening to Popovich, it sounded as if his relief was related more to a comforting realization for a coach in the moment. They weren’t about to blow it again.
