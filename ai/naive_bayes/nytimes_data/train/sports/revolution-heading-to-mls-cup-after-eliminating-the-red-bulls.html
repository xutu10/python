FOXBOROUGH, Mass. —  Charlie Davies scored two goals Saturday and the New England Revolution advanced to the M.L.S. Cup with a 4-3 aggregate victory against the Red Bulls in the Eastern Conference championship at Gillette Stadium.  The Revolution defeated the Red Bulls, 2-1, last week at Red Bull Arena. Saturday’s 2-2 tie in the second leg of the conference final enabled the Revolution to advance. The Red Bulls opened the scoring in the 26th minute when Thierry Henry chipped a cross into the Revolution penalty area to Tim Cahill, who was able to take the ball down and poke it out from under the feet of Revolution defender Jose Conclaves and into the net.  The Revolution tied the score in the 41st minute with Davies heading down a Chris Tierney cross past Red Bulls goalkeeper Luis Robles. The Red Bulls retook the lead in the 53rd minute when Andrew Farrell misplayed a cross in his penalty area to Peyguy Luyindula, who placed his shot between Revolution goalkeeper Bobby Shuttleworth’s legs.  Davies leveled the score again in the 70th minute with a header from another Tierney cross. The goal was Davies’s fourth of the playoffs. The Revolution will play in the final next week against either the Seattle Sounders or the Los Angeles Galaxy, who play in the second leg of the Western Conference final Sunday in Seattle.
