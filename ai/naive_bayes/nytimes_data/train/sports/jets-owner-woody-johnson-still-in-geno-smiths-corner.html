Jets Owner Woody Johnson Still in Geno Smith’s Corner
Speaking with reporters for the first time since June, Johnson said he still had a lot of confidence in Smith at quarterback despite the Jets’ 1-3 start.

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — With the Jets mired in a three-game losing streak, Woody Johnson, the team’s owner, said Thursday that Coach Rex Ryan and his players had “fallen short” so far this season, but he pledged his faith in the embattled quarterback Geno Smith. “If you look at what we’re doing, we haven’t won as many games as we want,” Johnson said. “I have a lot of confidence in Geno. I think Geno can be a franchise quarterback. I really do. I see traits in him, and we all see traits in him, that are extremely positive.” Johnson touched on several topics beyond Smith’s long-term (and short-term) viability at quarterback in a 15-minute interview session Thursday at practice. Speaking with reporters for the first time since June, Johnson defended the Jets’ salary-cap space, discussed their decision not to sign a top-flight cornerback and addressed Ryan’s job security, which may not be in jeopardy even if the team misses the N.F.L. playoffs for a fourth consecutive season. “We don’t look at it that way,” Johnson said, adding, “Those are the kinds of decisions we make at the end of the season and we’ll evaluate everybody and see what the best plan is going forward.” Told of Johnson’s comments later, Ryan said, “I’m not expecting a new salary at 1-3. I’m just glad he never said the other two words he could have said.” The Jets’ plan, as Johnson emphasized Thursday, is to achieve sustainable success, building mostly through the draft and dabbling, when necessary, in free agency. That could be construed as a patient approach and contrary to what Johnson said in March at the league meetings when he noted that he wanted, and expected, the Jets to win this season. “I don’t think patience is ever in my vernacular,” Johnson said, adding: “But good judgment is, I hope. None of us are patient, but we do have to have management skills and we know that it takes time to develop. We’re going to be a lot better at the end of the season than we are at the beginning of the season.” He added: “I mean, you can see signs of being a good team and a winning team, except for the one or two mistakes that we make in each game. If we eliminate those, I think we’ll be good.” Some of those mistakes have been made by Smith, who has committed seven turnovers in four games and lost his composure after  Johnson also said the general manager, John Idzik, has the autonomy to spend as he sees fit, adding that the Jets’ salary cap room — more than $20 million — can be used in the future for free agency and re-signing their players like the star defensive lineman Muhammad Wilkerson. He dismissed the notion that some of that money should have been used to upgrade a secondary that was vulnerable even before losing Dimitri Patterson, Dexter McDougle and Dee Milliner in training camp. “Every team has a weakness,” Johnson said. “I think the team can compensate. Rex knows how to handle weaknesses.” Johnson was vague about the team’s plans for the practice squad receiver Quincy Enunwa, who is facing charges related to domestic violence. Enunwa has continued to practice as the legal process runs its course. Speaking generally, Johnson said he could not say whether he would release a player found guilty of domestic violence. “That depends,” he said.
