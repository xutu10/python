TALLADEGA, Ala. —  Brad Keselowski pulled away in overtime Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway to earn an automatic berth into the third round of Nascar’s championship playoffs. Needing to win to stay alive in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, Keselowski, the 2012 Cup champion, came through with his series-best sixth victory of the year. But Hendrick Motorsports’ Jimmie Johnson,  Joey Logano, Kevin Harvick, Ryan Newman, Carl Edwards, Jeff Gordon, Denny Hamlin and Matt Kenseth advanced. Keselowski had a triumphant ending to a tumultuous week in which he was fined $50,000 by Nascar for his role in a fracas at Charlotte. Keselowski was in a deep hole in the second segment of the Chase because of a blown tire at Kansas and then a poor race last week at Charlotte. He faded over the final two laps and forced himself into a must-win situation Sunday. “I know there’s probably some people out there that aren’t really happy I won,” Keselowski said. “I can understand that. But I’m a man like anyone else and not real proud of last week. But I’m real proud of today.” Gordon is the lone Hendrick driver left in the Chase. Johnson failed in his bid to repeat as champion, missing a chance to match Richard Petty with a seventh career title. Earnhardt had won the Daytona 500 and two other races this season, putting up his best year in almost a decade and stamping himself an early championship favorite. Busch was second in the points race entering Sunday and appeared in solid shape to advance until he was caught up in what proved to be a contention-killing wreck.
