Jets Join Hands as They Tumble Downhill
The Jets’ offense, defense, special teams and coaching staff can all claim some responsibility for a 2-9 record.

The  “I thought going into the game that we had a great game plan in all phases,” Ryan said Tuesday in a teleconference, less than 24 hours after his Jets lost by 35 points to a team that had been displaced by a snowstorm, went four days between practices and had dropped its previous two games. Their 38-3 loss to the Bills presented a cornucopia of misery and ineptitude: a blocked punt, nine penalties, seven sacks, as many Ryan Quigley punts as Michael Vick completions (seven). Things like this happen when teams play the Jets, who have lost 9 of 11 games, who have been outscored by 126 points, who have the second-worst turnover margin (minus-12) in the N.F.L. Ryan has been asked several times, including again on Tuesday, why these things keep happening. Do the Jets have inferior talent? No, he said. Have the players let him down? No way, he said. Have the players quit on him? Not at all, he said. The accuracy of his answers can be debated — the inferior talent part, especially — but Ryan’s version of the truth differs from other people’s. He says what he believes to be the truth, and that, in a way, is one of his more admirable traits — call it an optimistic accountability. The thing about Ryan, and about football coaches everywhere, is that they believe things will always get better no matter how dire the circumstances — and these are indeed dire circumstances — and no matter how few games remain, and there are but five left in this colossal failure of a season. All the Jets need to do, all Ryan needs to do, is work a little harder: Spend a little more time analyzing film or practicing or studying the playbook. “I know we clearly have to get better, there’s no doubt,” Ryan said, adding, “I’m doing everything I think I can, but we just haven’t had the results yet.” Yet. On some level, Ryan must realize how this sounds, that disconnect between coach-speak and reality. According to him, it is all his fault, even though the blame can be spread throughout the organization, from the owner, Woody Johnson, to the general manager, John Idzik, to Ryan’s staff, to the locker room. If it requires a team effort to go 9-2, then the same certainly applies for 2-9. Everyone’s status will be evaluated after the season, and the only person who does not have to worry about his job is Johnson himself. Such are the perks of owning a team. The perks of coaching a team are different, more fleeting. There is an old saying in the industry, that it never gets better than the first day in charge. Every day thereafter, you move closer to losing the job. Ryan has not fulfilled the grand expectations he established for himself, for the team, the day he was introduced. Though he says that he does not concern himself with the idea of being fired, he is unlikely to survive a fourth consecutive season missing the playoffs. If Johnson were undecided, Monday’s debacle could have clinched it for him. The scope of it prompted Ryan to make up a new word: outeverythinged. “It’s just such a poor performance that it’s hard to watch,” Ryan said. No unit was exempt — not the Jets’ offense, which breached the red zone only once; not their defense, which allowed four touchdowns to a team that entered the game not having scored any in its previous 21 possessions; and not their special teams, which also featured a shanked Quigley punt and Percy Harvin’s unhealthy insistence at costing the Jets field position by getting slammed soon after running out kickoff after kickoff from deep in the end zone. Not that it matters much, but Ryan declined to announce a starting quarterback for the Jets’ next game, Monday night against Miami. He has quite a choice: the quarterback who was pulled Oct. 26 against Buffalo because of ineffectiveness, or the quarterback who was pulled Monday night against Buffalo because of ineffectiveness. Four weeks after Geno Smith lost his starting job to Vick against the Bills, it was Vick who bumbled through the first 40 minutes of the game Monday, going 7 for 19 with an interception before being replaced. Asked what factors he would consider, Ryan said, as he often does, that he will do what is best for the team. “We’re running out of tomorrows,” he said.
