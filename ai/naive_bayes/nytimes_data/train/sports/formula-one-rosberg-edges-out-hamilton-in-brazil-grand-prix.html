Rosberg Edges Out Hamilton in Brazil Grand Prix
With only one race left in the season, the Mercedes teammates are battling it out for the drivers' title.
===
SÃO PAULO, Brazil — With two races left in the  Rosberg, who is aiming to take his first Formula One title and who trailed Hamilton by 24 points before the race in Brazil, rose to the challenge in a manner that few could have expected: For the first time this season, Rosberg, a German driver, was the fastest man in every practice and qualifying session of the weekend and then masterfully won the race. The one to crack was Hamilton. Starting in second position, the British driver pushed closely behind Rosberg for most of the first half of the race, before he made a mistake on Lap 28, just before his second pit stop, and skidded sideways off the track, spoiling his chances to pass. He nevertheless managed to finish in the necessary second place. It was the eighth victory of Rosberg’s career, his first in Brazil, and his fifth this season. “I am very happy with the whole weekend. I was able to attack and control the gap to Lewis,” Rosberg said. “There is still all to play for, and I hope to keep this going.” Hamilton now leads the series by 17 points, with 334 points to 317 for Rosberg. But in a new scoring system this season, the last race will be worth double the usual points. The victory, therefore, will be worth 50 points, and second place will be worth 34 points. In other words, the last race, in Abu Dhabi, is a wide-open affair for the two Mercedes drivers, but all Hamilton has to do is finish second, if Rosberg wins again. “I will drive pretty much the same, and hopefully improve,” Hamilton said. “It’s everything to play for in the last race.” Leading the race on Lap 28 after Rosberg made his second pit stop, Hamilton was driving as fast as he could and was almost certain to pass Rosberg after his own pit stop. But as he entered Turn 4 he slid off the track, losing seven seconds in the error. “I locked the rears into Turn 4 and it spun me around, and it was no one’s fault but mine,” Hamilton said. “I was pushing right to the checkered flag, which is what motor racing is all about. I just loved it.” After his pit stop, Hamilton ended up 6.7 seconds behind Rosberg after Lap 30 of the 71-lap race, and he had given Rosberg a vital psychological boost. By Lap 49 Hamilton was just over 2 seconds behind, and after Lap 50 Rosberg made his third pit stop. Hamilton again made an effort to gain ground as he led the race, hoping to pass Rosberg after his own final pit stop. He made that pit stop after the next lap, but he had not had enough time to close in on his teammate and came out just behind Rosberg. The race was exciting from the beginning to the end, and the tension was ever-present. In the final 14 laps of the race the Mercedes cars were fighting the battle against each other, as well as negotiating the lapping of the tail-end cars. Hamilton pushed Rosberg at only half a second behind him throughout those final laps, but he just could not pass him as the two exchanged fastest laps of the race one after the other. “Overall I’m really happy,” Hamilton said. “When I came back I had the pace on Nico, but he did not make a mistake.” Hamilton ended up driving the fastest lap of the race, 1 minute 13.5 seconds, on Lap 62. Felipe Massa of Brazil, the local favorite, started in third position, but he was penalized for speeding in the pit lane after his first pit stop and dropped to the back of the pack. He managed to move back up to third position by Lap 36, before making a slow pit stop when he drove into the wrong pit area on his third pit stop after Lap 51. He still managed to finish the race in third place in his Williams. But he was 41 seconds behind the winner. “I am so happy for the race,” Massa said, explaining that his pit stop error happened because the McLaren team’s silver uniform colors are similar to the white ones of his team. “I’m not happy for my mistakes.” The victory was the 15th for Mercedes this season, which equaled the team record by McLaren in 1988, when that team won all but one of the 16 races. It was the Mercedes team’s 11th one-two finish this season, which is also a record.
