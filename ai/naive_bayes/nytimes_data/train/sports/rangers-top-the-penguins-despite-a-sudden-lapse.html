Rangers Top the Penguins Despite a Sudden Lapse
The Rangers gave up a two-goal lead late in the third-period but went on to beat the Penguins in overtime, on a goal by defenseman Kevin Klein.
===
The  On Monday, the  The Penguins were back for their final visit this season with a decimated roster -- missing four top forwards and two key defensemen. With a prime chance to generate a burst of positive momentum before starting a western trip this weekend, the Rangers summoned an inconsistent effort but managed to escape with a 4-3 overtime victory on a goal by defenseman Kevin Klein. J. T. Miller and Rick Nash scored second-period goals for the Rangers, and Kevin Hayes put them ahead by 3-1 with an unassisted goal at 12 minutes 58 seconds of the third. The Rangers seemed poised to finish a confidence-building win when Evgeni Malkin and Steve Downie scored 24 seconds apart late in the third to force overtime. Malkin scored his 15th front in front at 15:17, and Downie picked up a loose puck and shot it past Henrik Lundqvist at 15:41. Klein's heroics came at 3:45 of overtime when his blast from the point eluded Marc-Andre Fleury for his sixth goal this season and second overtime winner. Lundqvist, who made 32 saves, has played well against Pittsburgh. He is 5-1-3 in his last nine regular-season games and won the last three contests over the Penguins in their second-round playoff series last May. The game had an unusually mellow tone for a Rangers-Penguins showdown. The main highlight was visual, as the Rangers wore white sweaters for a change while Pittsburgh donned black and gold. Nick Spaling opened the scoring at 12:35 of the first for the Penguins, rifling a shot past Lundqvist from the left circle for his fourth goal of the season. His new linemates, Crosby and Steven Downie, assisted. Crosby, who leads the Penguins with 35 points, usually centers for Chris Kunitz and Patric Hornqvist, who are injured. Also missing from the Pittsburgh lineup were defensemen Kris Letang and Olli Maatta and forwards Beau Bennett and Pascal Dupuis. Miller broke through against Fleury, tipping a slick cross-ice pass from Martin St. Louis past the goaltender for his second goal this season at 3:50. Rick Nash put the Rangers ahead with his team-best 18th goal at 8:40, knocking his own rebound past Fleury and his all-gold pads. Only Tyler Seguin of Dallas has more goals than Nash, with 21. Nash has been a driving force in his third season in New York. The 6-foot-4 left wing has points in 21 of the team's 26 games and goals in 16 contests. Even with their myriad lineup challenges, the Penguins still lead the Metropolitan at 18-6-3. The Rangers are 5-4-2 since the shutout of the Penguins, with three of the wins against Philadelphia. Crosby talked after his team's morning skate about the challenges of having a new coach, Mike Johnston, and many fresh faces dotting the lineup since the Rangers ended Pittsburgh's postseason. The Penguins dressed unfamiliar names like forwards Jayson Megna and Andrew Ebbett and the newly acquired Rob Klinkhammer. Pittsburgh did not seem to generate their usual offensive fervor in front of Lundqvist. "We aim to keep it simple," Crosby said. "It's difficult throwing these guys in. The key is to execute when you get chances. But that just comes with time." The Rangers will have four days off for the second straight week. They will have games in Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary before concluding their trip in Carolina. Their next home game will be Dec. 21. SLAPSHOTS Chris Kreider missed the game with neck spasms. ... The Rangers also scratched defenseman Matt Hunwick and forward Anthony Duclair.
