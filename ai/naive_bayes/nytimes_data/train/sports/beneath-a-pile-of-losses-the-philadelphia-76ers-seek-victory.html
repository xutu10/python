Beneath a Pile of Losses, the Philadelphia 76ers Seek Victory
The 76ers, who, beyond their most recent top draft picks may be the most anonymous team in modern N.B.A. history, have not recorded a win this season.

PHILADELPHIA —  For as long as there has been professional basketball in Philadelphia, Harvey Pollack has promoted it or kept statistical track of it. His 68-year career, begun in 1946, has spanned two local franchises; two comings of Wilt Chamberlain; one each of Julius Erving and Allen Iverson; a slew of colorful owners, executives, coaches and players; and four championships. Pollack has known, served and outlasted them all. “I’m the only one in this city with all four rings,” he said, noting that each ring — two with the Warriors, who moved to the Bay Area in California, and two with the  “Oh, yeah, I got another finger,” he said. But the 76ers, building from the ground up — or laying a foundation from the Eastern Conference basement — do not appear to be taking into account that Pollack, whose title since 1987 has been director of statistical information, is 92. His recall is sharp. He rarely misses a home game. But for this season, he is resigned to hoping that the 76ers just do better than the 1972-73 team, which went 9-73, the worst mark ever for an 82-game  “I don’t like it, but I’m putting up with it,” Pollack said Wednesday night over dinner in the news media dining room. A few minutes later, the 76ers trotted out to play the Orlando Magic in a matchup of 0-4 titans that was assured of producing a winner — in this case the Magic, 91-89, on a buzzer-beating jump shot. The 76ers could have used first names on the backs of their jerseys along with their surnames. To be more than marginally familiar with their roster would require the brain of Jay Bilas, the ESPN college basketball savant. K. J. McDaniels? Chris Johnson? Malcolm Thomas? Hollis Thompson? Beyond their most recent top draft picks, the 76ers may be the most anonymous team in modern N.B.A. history. Including Joel Embiid, their injured 7-footer, they have four rookies, three second-year players and four players with two years of experience. Two veterans, Luc Mbah a Moute and the injured Jason Richardson, have combined for 18 N.B.A. seasons. The other 13 players have logged a collective 15. This is a strategy summarized by the controlling owner, Joshua Harris, a private equity executive. Upon purchasing controlling interest of the team during a league lockout in October 2011, Harris said, “We don’t want to be 41-41.” In other words: running on a playoff contention treadmill, ultimately to nowhere. During the shortened 2011-12 season, the Sixers slipped into the playoffs in the eighth and final position, upset the top-seeded Chicago Bulls — minus Derrick Rose — in the first round and got within a game of the Eastern Conference finals. Believing contention was one bold move away, they acquired center Andrew Bynum from the Lakers in a four-team trade that cost them two players and a first-round draft pick. Bynum hobbled into town on deteriorating knees and enigmatically set his rehabilitation back on a bowling night out. He never played a game for the 76ers and was gone by the following season. So was much of the front-office staff. In came Sam Hinkie — a Stanford graduate and basketball analytics devotee out of the Houston organization — as president and general manager. Hinkie hired Brett Brown, a 12-year assistant to Gregg Popovich in San Antonio, as coach and began jettisoning established players, including point guard Jrue Holiday. Holiday’s trade to New Orleans helped land the 6-foot-11 Kentucky freshman Nerlens Noel, who spent his first year in Philadelphia rehabilitating a knee injury. Embiid, who broke his foot before the 2014 draft, may not play this season. Another intriguing 2014 pick, the Croatian forward Dario Saric, is contractually committed in Turkey for two more years. Hence, Hinkie is more or less assured of at least one more high lottery pick next June to continue assembling a core that began with point guard Michael Carter-Williams, last season’s rookie of the year. Out until next week with a shoulder injury, and with only 70 pro games played, Carter-Williams said Wednesday night, “Definitely, I feel like I am the leader on this team.” Hinkie is loath to discuss his plan — not for the record, anyway — because questions invariably address the distinction between building and tanking. There were suspicions the 76ers were doing just that last season, prompting the league to consider — and reject — a reconfiguration of its lottery draft system. More recently, the former Sixers coach Larry Brown took a more personal stand against the long-term losing approach. “I hate what’s going on in Philly,” he told The Philadelphia Inquirer. “They don’t have a basketball person in the organization. It makes me sick to my stomach.” In an email, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver dismissed Brown’s nausea, saying: “First of all, no team goes on the court trying to lose games. What’s sometimes labeled tanking in our league is, in my view, more accurately described as rebuilding. Unfortunately, rebuilding a team is not easy in any league and takes time and careful planning.” But he added: “I am concerned by the often cited conventional wisdom that finishing at the bottom (in order to acquire better draft picks) presents the only reliable path for some teams to build a championship roster. The draft is structured to help the teams with the worst records, but it’s an imperfect system. In fact, many top picks do not transform their teams.” That is a risk Harris and Hinkie are willing to take, improving the odds over several years. They have slashed some ticket prices to help paying fans through it. Hinkie, according to one person in the organization, was heartened when Billy Cunningham — who played on one 76ers title team (1967) and coached the 1983 champions led by Erving and Moses Malone — came to the Sixers’ home opener and expressed an opinion somewhat antithetical to Brown’s. “I tip my hat that they have the fortitude to try it,” he said, adding that the only way to win in the N.B.A. was to draft or acquire at least two superstars and surround them with the right complementary talent. Done through the draft, he said, “that’s a long process.” Better than most, Cunningham knows that Philadelphia — unlike New York, where the mantra, or myth, is that fans won’t tolerate long-term reconstruction — is a city worth experimenting in because it has seldom been an N.B.A. boomtown. In 1966-67, when the Sixers of Chamberlain and Chet Walker won 68 games and finally beat Bill Russell’s Celtics, they drew 8,724 fans a game. In the Erving years, they often averaged about two-thirds capacity at the old Spectrum. One Sunday afternoon in 1981, an announced crowd of 6,704 showed up to watch Erving and company nip the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 7 of a playoff series. So it was not the market that drew Brett Brown to Philadelphia. He was comfortable in San Antonio, ensconced in the league’s most respected team-first culture. “I obviously didn’t take this job to pad my résumé,” he said. “But I get pretty grumpy when people talk about culture and never attach the word longevity to it.” He and Hinkie dream of an eventual front line of Noel, Embiid and Saric, along with Carter-Williams, more lottery talent to come and ample cap space for veteran support. Before spraining his ankle Wednesday, Noel flashed his potential, an athletic big man leading a fast break and hitting Alexey Shved with a behind-the-back bounce pass for a layup. At the other end, he gracefully blocked a shot, keeping the ball in bounds, Russell-like. He also turned the ball over three times, dribbling into lane traffic. Local reporters suspect the Sixers are padding the gate with giveaways, but a spirited crowd of 12,111 roared Wednesday night when Henry Sims tied the game with 4.9 seconds left with a jumper from the key. Tobias Harris dimmed the enthusiasm at the Wells Fargo Center with his game-winning 21-footer. In the front row, a fan in a red Iverson jersey, 40-year-old Damien Kaleokas of North Philadelphia, punched the air in frustration. His friend, 38-year-old Aaron Winger of Lancaster, a four-year season-ticket holder, said: “We have something to build on. But I would like improvement by next year.” Brown gave no forecast, only a guarantee that ownership was committed to Hinkie’s plan and “we’re trying to be smart, have a long lens.” Back in the news media dining room, Pollack joked that his career was as old as the league itself — those 1946-47 Warriors won the first title of what was then called the Basketball Association of America — and he had waited 31 years for a fifth ring. “What’s a few more?” he said. “But only a few.”
