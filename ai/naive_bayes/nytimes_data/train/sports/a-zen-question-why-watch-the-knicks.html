A Zen Question: Why Watch the Knicks?
I was raised a connoisseur of terrible, horrible, very bad pro teams: Mets-Jets-Knicks. But the 2014-15 Knicks are in hot pursuit of historic bad.
===
My son Nick and I walked out of the rain into the vale of tears that is Madison Square Garden just before the start of Tuesday night’s  If seeing a competitive basketball game was our aim — and, just for giggles, why not? — we should have sprinted to our seats. Every team in the league is tied at the opening tip. Instead, we tempted fate and ducked into the concourse to buy an overpriced chicken taco, or two, and a couple of beers. As I paid my bill at the register, I glanced at the television set. Dirk Nowitzki had hit a rainbow 20-footer. It was two and a half minutes into the game and the Knicks trailed by 4. Behind me a lawyer groaned. “I can’t take it,” he muttered. “If this keeps up, I’m leaving at halftime.” It kept up. We settled into our seats at the 7:47 point in the first quarter. The Knicks were down 19-7. The computerized loudspeaker system implored: “Make some NOOOOISE!” No thanks. I’ll pass. The Knicks trailed by 10 at the half, which gave the impression that they were in the game. They were not. I was raised a connoisseur of terrible, horrible, very bad pro teams. Mets-Jets-Knicks: That’s where Powell family loyalties lie. Maybe it’s contagious. Nick, my older son, was assigned this year to cover the football Giants, that solid, well-run franchise, for NJ.com, and that team promptly did a season-long header. This particular Knicks team is a car in hot pursuit of historic bad. At its current pace, it will finish with 15 wins, a franchise record for futility. (The House of Dolan has multiple submissions in this category; its teams twice have finished with 23 wins.) So much is wrong with this team. Let’s start by taking match and kerosene to straw men. Zen Phil and his Triangle offense have nothing to do with this. You could try an isosceles, scalene or equilateral triangle offense. You could toss in a rectangle, a trapezoid and the underappreciated rhombus. You could make the Knicks run the break by skipping down the court single file. None of it would make a difference. I’m sure he’s kind to little dogs and babies, but if Quincy Acy starts at power forward for your team, it needs to be in the N.B.A. Development League. Tim Hardaway Jr. as a starting guard offers a study in cluelessness: Why is he wandering left if the man he is guarding is cutting right? Is that Andrea Bargnani, hampered by the longest standing hamstring strain in league history, sitting at the end of the bench? Have the Knicks started charging him for a courtside seat? A friend, Jesse Jahr, devotes an unfortunate amount of time to deconstructing the myriad maladies of this Knicks team. He notes they have surrendered 41 more 3-point shots than they have made. That does not mean they are bone-crushers in the paint. The team ranks dead last in free throws made per offensive play. That’s almost precisely the opposite of the formula followed by the Los Angeles Lakers when they lost in the 2008 N.B.A. finals to the Boston Celtics. Zen Phil coached that team. Defense is a dark art that entirely eludes this team. In the third quarter, this happened: Al-Farouq Aminu made a 3-pointer. J.J. Barea scooted down the middle and laid a soft one off the backboard as if on a layup line. Monta Ellis hit a 21-footer. On none of these plays did a Knicks player make an ambulatory stab at defense. You waited for a “Seventh Sign” moment, as the roof of the Garden ruptures and the legendary Knicks coach Red Holzman, risen from his grave, declares this team a blood libel on the very notion of defense. “I thought the start was not the right way to start a professional basketball game,” Coach Derek Fisher said after the game. “Those guys that were in there to start the game, that was a disappointment to their teammates.” Poor Fisher. This summer offered a game show choice for rookie coaches: Door No. 1 offered the coaching vacancy at the Golden State Warriors. Steve Kerr had a polite dinner or two with  The Warriors were a pump well primed with spectacular young talent. That team is 21-3. Fisher chose Door No. 2 and the Knicks. God save his eternal soul. The Knicks are not 21-3. We are sports dead-enders. My younger son, Aidan, is agitating to grab Knicks tickets when he returns from college. We don’t leave until the final pitch, pass or buzzer. In the fourth quarter Dallas hit jumpers and layups, punctuated by a 3-pointer by Richard Jefferson. No Knick was within his ZIP code. The Knicks trailed by 20 points with 5:54 left. Somewhere in a recess of my cranium, I heard that anthem by the Clash: “Should I stay or should I go?” We left.
