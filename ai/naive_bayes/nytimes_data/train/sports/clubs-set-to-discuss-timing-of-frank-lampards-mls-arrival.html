Clubs Set to Discuss Timing of Frank Lampard’s M.L.S. Arrival
New York City F.C. officials still expect to have Lampard, their marquee signing, leave Manchester City and join the team in time for the 2015 M.L.S. season.

Officials from Manchester City and New York City F.C. will meet in England next week to decide whether to extend midfielder Frank Lampard’s loan with the Premier League club or to release him in early 2015 so he can join the New York team as it prepares for its first season in Major League Soccer. The question of Lampard’s status has hovered over the introduction of New York City F.C., fed largely by his strong performances for Manchester City, which remains a contender for the Premier League and UEFA Champions League titles, and by the recent comments of his coach there, Manuel Pellegrini, who said  At a question-and-answer session with fans in Manhattan on Friday, New York City Coach Jason Kreis and the team’s director of football, Claudio Reyna, each expressed optimism that Lampard would arrive on time. Lampard is New York City’s biggest signing to date, and the club has marketed him heavily, so his absence at the team’s introduction would be a blow. “The decision should be made in the middle of December,” Kreis said. “It will be made by the people that own this club, and I have full trust that they’re going to make a decision that’s going to be best for Frank, best for Manchester City and best for New York City. At the end of the day I have full trust in that decision and we will live by whatever it is.” Reyna called the decision “a group call” by the leadership of both teams, including each club’s coach and technical staff and even the Manchester City chairman, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan. Manchester City owns New York City F.C. in a partnership with the Yankees. “Ultimately, if the decision is made that they need to keep him there for any length of time, I’m going to completely understand, respect and support that decision,” Kreis said. The countdown to New York City F.C.'s opening game recently crept under 100 days. The team will gather in Florida on January 24 for nine days of preseason training, then travel to Manchester for about two weeks, including exhibition matches on Feb. 10 and 15. It is possible that Lampard could join the team at either point, or — if the club decides to keep him on its Premier League roster — not until later, in the spring. The M.L.S. season begins in early March. “In an ideal world, for me, we want our players to be with us from day one,” Kreis said. “And day one for us is January 24.” Pellegrini told reporters recently that keeping Lampard with Manchester City beyond the start of New York City’s preseason camp was an option, but he acknowledged that the decision was not his to make. “If all parties agree, then maybe we can keep him,” Pellegrini said, “but it could be that we want to keep him and Frank wants to go.” In the end, the decision could hinge on City’s Champions League game at Roma on Wednesday, its last in the group stage. City and Roma are fighting for second place in their group behind Bayern Munich. If City advances to the knockout stage in the winter and spring, the pressure to keep Lampard in England will increase. If they tumble out of the competition, there could be more incentive to allow him to start his career in New York on time.
