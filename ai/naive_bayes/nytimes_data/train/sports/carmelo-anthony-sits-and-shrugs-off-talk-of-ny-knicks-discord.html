Carmelo Anthony Sits, and Shrugs Off Talk of Discord
Anthony rested his sore left knee during the Knicks’ loss to the San Antonio Spurs, their ninth straight defeat, and denied that a players-only meeting had been particularly contentious.

SAN ANTONIO —  After a brief and eventful stint as a free agent, which included momentary flirtations with other organizations,  In the five months since then, almost everything that could go wrong around Anthony has done so. His plight was obvious early Wednesday night at the AT&T; Center in San Antonio, where he was juggling conundrums on multiple fronts. The broadest and most protracted of the problems has been the Knicks’ horrendous play and consequently ugly record, which dropped to 4-19 after their ninth straight defeat Tuesday night. Adding to the storm, on Wednesday morning,  The most significant problem of all, however, crystallized on Wednesday night, just before tip-off against the  “We really don’t know exactly — or I can’t tell you exactly — what is the problem,” Anthony said. The same fuzzy judgment might be said about the team as a whole. The Knicks started the day tied for the most losses in the league — seemingly ripe conditions for a story to emerge about internal discord. The article said that Anthony had a verbal spat with teammate Tim Hardaway Jr. during a game last week against the Nets. The report also said that Knicks players told Anthony that they were unhappy with his style of play — that he was not playing team basketball — and also that many players were displeased with Coach Derek Fisher’s systems. Neither Anthony nor Hardaway denied on Wednesday that they had clashed on the court, but both men said the issue was behind them and described a fruitful mentor-student relationship. Anthony, meanwhile, reiterated his commitment to the team and to perfecting Fisher’s system, including the triangle offense. As far as hearing criticism from his teammates, Anthony revealed that there was a players-only meeting on Saturday at the team’s practice facility in which various concerns were raised, but he denied it had become particularly contentious. “Everybody had a platform to speak their piece, and what they felt about what’s going on, and how we can better the situation,” Anthony said. “But it wasn’t no pointing fingers or anything like that, or solely pointing me out to be blamed.” Fisher deferred questions about any possible discord to the players — though he said friction within a team was not unusual. Fisher will have other headaches without his best player. He said he hoped Anthony could play Friday in Boston against the Celtics, but he said the Knicks would have to wait and see how the player progressed. Fisher lamented that the injury had forced Anthony to miss valuable time with his teammates, particularly in practice situations. “I think overall it’s impacting him quite a bit, just in terms of being able to do things out there physical,” Fisher said. In the long term, the Knicks might grow concerned seeing the health problems accumulate for Anthony, who has not been injury-prone in his career. Entering this season (and excluding the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season), he appeared in an average of 73.5 games per season — a high total that reflected his durability. Last season, Anthony played in 77 games while averaging a league- and career-high 38.7 minutes per game. It was clear at times, however, that then-Coach Mike Woodson was over-relying on Anthony, who appeared fatigued by the end of the season. Anthony has not been entirely unbreakable, though. His style of play is often predicated on drawing contact from defenders, and he has occasionally paid the price. He spent the summer before the start of the 2013-14 season recovering from what he described as labrum and rotator cuff tears in his left shoulder. And he missed the final two games of last season after straining his right shoulder. Anthony sat out the games on Nov. 26 and 28 after experiencing spasms in his lower back. It was apparently a first-time issue for Anthony and thus a new concern for the franchise, which is paying him $124 million through the 2018-19 season, when he will be 35 years old. Already, Anthony ranks 24th among active players in minutes played, with 29,587, according to  Regarding his left knee, Anthony said on Wednesday that surgery would be a last option — one he was not yet considering. He said the injury was not supposed to get worse, and that whether he plays on a given night might depend on his pain threshold. “Some days are better than others,” Anthony said. In terms of his season, there have not been many good ones so far.
