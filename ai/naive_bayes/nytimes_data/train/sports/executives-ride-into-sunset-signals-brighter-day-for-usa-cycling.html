Executive’s Ride Into Sunset Signals Brighter Day for U.S.A. Cycling
Steve Johnson, the president and chief executive during the rampant doping of the Lance Armstrong era, will leave after the world championships next fall.

An early holiday gift landed on the doorstep of the sport of cycling last week. It didn’t come wrapped in shiny paper, or decorated with a bow. But a note said it was from Bob Stapleton, the new chairman of U.S.A. Cycling, and now every single clean American cyclist has reason to celebrate. That gift was the news that Steve Johnson, the president and chief executive of U.S.A. Cycling, will leave his job after the world championships next fall, concluding nearly a decade of leadership of cycling in the United States. It means that, finally, the man who, since 1999, has been entrenched in the top level of the sport and its politics will hop on his bike and ride off into the sunset. I say finally — and hooray — because it is high time for Johnson to exit the national federation, stage left. Really, he missed his cue a few years ago. A big hook should have dragged him out of his corner office in 2012, when  Instead, Johnson, who told me Tuesday he was retiring at 64 because he was “old and crotchety,” remained in charge. Which was kind of like a principal keeping his job when his top students cheated on tests for more than a decade, and everybody else — teachers, other students, parents — knew about it and walked the hallways passing one another answer keys in broad daylight. Maybe that principal didn’t know about the cheating. But if he was any good at his profession, he should have known. Sure, U.S.A. Cycling is much stronger financially than when Johnson took over, and Johnson boasted to me about that. But sports should be about more than just the bottom line. Integrity has to be equally important, if the clean athletes are to believe they are getting a fair shot at winning. Leaders like Johnson are all too common in Olympic sports. Look at Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA, soccer’s worldwide governing body. He has been president for 16 years now, and even his first election was clouded by accusations of bribery. His tenure has been marred by embezzlement, match fixing and (more) bribery. Under his watch, nearly half of FIFA’s executive committee members have been tarnished by ethics violations. So what did Blatter get for being in charge during that dark time? The possibility of a fifth term! What did Johnson get for being a weak leader and for being either complicit or ignorant about the doping in the sport? Well, last year, he got about $357,000, according to U.S.A. Cycling’s tax filings. If that’s what you get for failing at USA Cycling, I’d like to see the bank accounts of those who succeed. It’s good that Johnson is on his way out, but bad that he is staying for nearly another year, to aid in the transition to a new president, considering his inaction during the past several years regarding doping in the sport. In 2010, he was among those who had received emails from Floyd Landis that detailed the doping on the Postal Service team. But instead of speaking out loudly about clean sport, Johnson only spoke in whispers, if at all. “I am surprised at all of this,” he told me when I got him on the phone in late 2010 and asked him about the possibility that Armstrong and so many other American riders might have doped. If Johnson truly had been a proponent of antidoping, he would have protected the riders who were testifying against Armstrong in his doping case. Yet two people with ties to U.S.A. Cycling say the names of witnesses were leaked to the news media out of the federation’s headquarters. The worst part of Johnson’s tenure might be that, according to Zabriskie, he knew about doping on the team long before the Armstrong scandal broke. Zabriskie told me two years ago that he had admitted to Johnson in 2004, then again in 2006, that he had been given performance-enhancing drugs while riding on the Postal Service team. And he said that Johnson, who had befriended him when Zabriskie was just a teenager, never did a thing about it. Johnson said Tuesday that Zabriskie never told him that he had doped. Zabriskie’s accusations didn’t sit well with Stapleton, who became chairman of U.S.A. Cycling last summer and has been a longtime proponent of eradicating doping from the sport. He investigated the claims against Johnson but couldn’t find any hard evidence to use against him, said the two people with ties to U.S.A. Cycling who aren’t authorized to speak publicly about the issue. Stapleton, the former owner of the HTC-Highroad team, declined on Tuesday to discuss with me the details of Johnson’s parting on Tuesday, choosing instead to focus on where U.S.A. Cycling can go, not where it has been. He said the search for a new president and C.E.O. was underway. Because U.S.A. Cycling has been painfully silent on important issues for so long, it was easy to like what he had to say. “We’re going back to fundamentals, back to the sport as a healthy lifestyle and the highest ideals of sport, like hard work, discipline and fair play — those American ideals and sense of values about sport,” Stapleton said. “I want our athletes, our fans, everybody, to believe in what we’re doing and believe that we’re a standup organization and believe that we’re going to do things the right way.” If Stapleton is able to accomplish what he has in mind, “a watershed change” for the organization, it will be a gift that will keep on giving.
