Sergio Agüero a One-Man Rescue Team for City
Agüero scored a hat trick as Manchester City stayed alive in the Champions League with a 3-2 comeback victory over Bayern Munich.

LONDON —  In the fictional world of Charles Dickens, street children lurked in the shadows to pick the pockets of the rich. In the real world of now,  On Tuesday, three days after scoring a hat trick to become the all-time record holder in Spanish soccer, Messi repeated the feat in the Champions League. Messi entered the game tied with the former Real Madrid player Raúl with 71 goals as the most prolific striker in top European competition. It took him 38 minutes into a 4-0 victory over APOEL Nicosia to break the record and eclipse not just Raúl, but everyone else who has ever played. “My opinion of Messi?” Giorgos Donis, the APOEL manager, said to journalists. “It is the same as everyone else’s opinion. He is a phenomenon. We need to be realistic. It is one thing to watch  And Messi said, as Messi does, that while it was “nice” to have the records, it was nicer still for Barça to get three more points in the competition. His three goals, all finished off with his supposedly weaker right foot, were simply the deft finishing strokes of a goal thief who has that gift, that instinct, to find time and space where few even think to look. Among those few is Messi’s teammate, Luis Suárez. The Uruguayan’s cunning turn and unerring low shot gave him his first competitive goal since arriving from Liverpool over the summer. Another of those few is Agüero. There are daily bulletins that Agüero, who is small, swift and mobile like his countryman Messi and like Diego Maradona before them, has hamstring problems. Perhaps it’s because of the way he moves, his habit of lurking on the shoulders of the last opposing defender before darting free, too fast to counter. Agüero is not Messi. He is vital to Manchester City in one singular, superlative aspect. He scores by far the bulk of his team’s goals, scores when no other man in the pale blue shirt would. Without Agüero, there would be no hope for City in the Champions League. So far this season, Agüero has taken to the field in 18 games. He has scored 17 goals but (and this is where he differs from Messi) created just one for a colleague. That is not to detract from Agüero’s value or his qualities. He is paid to score. Vincent Kompany, the City captain, said after Tuesday’s great escape as the team came back from a 2-1 deficit to beat Bayern Munich 3-2, “Every team that wants to achieve special things needs a special player, and he is our special player.” He, of course, is Agüero. There is no other goal scorer remotely like him at City. And with Suárez gone, only Diego Costa of Chelsea is as capable as Agüero in applying the finishing touches with such consistency in England. “When he performs like he did today,” Kompany said, “he makes a lot of things possible that normally would be difficult.” Kompany underplays the dependency somewhat. For much of the contest at City’s Etihad Stadium, Manchester allowed Bayern to dominate, despite the fact that the German champion was reduced to 10 men after Mehdi Benatia was red carded in the 20th minute. Benatia’s crime? He was too slow to keep up with Agüero and attempted a tackle from behind. Agüero shot the penalty kick with such composure, accuracy and power that Manuel Neuer, the world’s No.1 goalkeeper, could not get his hands to the ball. Even though it was down a player, Bayern nevertheless imposed its rhythmic passing on the game. By halftime it led through opportunist strikes from Xabi Alonso and Robert Lewandowski, and as time wore on, it seemed that the German club would comfortably be able to hold on to its lead. Munich had already won Group E, and perhaps its lack of necessity, and certainly the tiredness that comes from playing short a man for two-thirds of a game, encouraged City’s comeback. Even so, with time running out and urgency making the home side rush their passes, the denouement seemed unlikely. The game turned on the errors of tiring Bayern players and the predatory acumen of Agüero. Five minutes from the end, the 33-year-old Xabi made a weary, wayward pass. It was intercepted by City’s Stevan Jovetic, but when he momentarily let the ball get away, Agüero sprang out of nowhere. With Dante racing too late to block his path, and with Neuer moving toward him head-on, Agüero was quick and calm and decisive with his left foot as he shot into the bottom corner of the net to tie the game, 2-2. There was a gesture from the sideline by City Coach Manuel Pellegrini, asking Agüero if he needed to come off. Agüero had not trained this week because of his suspect hamstring, but he signaled that he had no intention of leaving with unfinished business on the field. City huffed and it puffed. The clock ticked away, beyond the 90th minute and into the time added on for stoppages. Time enough for Agüero. The ball was flicked between Bayern’s two central defenders, Jérôme Boateng and Dante. In size they dwarf Agüero, but as the coaches say, the first yard of movement is in the head. And within that yard, Agüero was through them and drew the keeper forward before slipping the ball beyond Neuer’s reach for the winning goal. Quicker than you could say Charles Dickens, the Argentines can pick the pockets of Europe’s tightest defenses.
