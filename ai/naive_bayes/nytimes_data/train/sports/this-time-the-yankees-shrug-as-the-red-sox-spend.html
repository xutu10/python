This Time, the Yankees Shrug as the Red Sox Spend
On Monday, the Red Sox committed nearly $200 million to sign Pablo Sandoval and Hanley Ramirez in moves that resembled Yankees tactics of the past. But the Yankees barely flinched.

In years past, if the  When Boston signed Daisuke Matsuzaka, the Yankees went and picked up Kei Igawa. When the Red Sox were close to signing Mark Teixeira, the Yankees swept in at the last moment and stole him away. And when the Red Sox wanted Jose Contreras, the Yankees opened the vault for him, too. But those days have been over for a long time. On Monday, the Red Sox committed nearly $200 million to sign Pablo Sandoval and Hanley Ramirez in a surprising combination of moves that resembled Yankees tactics of the past. But the Yankees barely flinched. They remained quiet, sticking to their off-season plan to add specific and moderate pieces without spending nearly as lavishly as they did a year ago. Back then, the additions of Brian McCann, Jacoby Ellsbury, Masahiro Tanaka, Carlos Beltran, Brian Roberts and Kelly Johnson came at a cost of roughly half a billion dollars over the length of all the deals, and the Yankees still did not make the playoffs. The hope is that the contracts will still pay off, particularly with Ellsbury, McCann and Tanaka. But after that costly off-season, it would be hard for  So the Yankees’ plan going into this off-season was to stay away from the top free agents, including Sandoval and Ramirez, as well as the best starting pitchers on the market, like Jon Lester, Max Scherzer and James Shields. Perhaps they could experience a change of heart with one of those pitchers. It would not be the first time that had happened. But the Yankees had resolved not to go after Sandoval or Ramirez, fearing a significant decline in performance by the end of a multiyear contract. They also are working under a philosophy that it is no longer sound business to give six or seven years to 30-year-old starting pitchers. But they need a shortstop, at least one starting pitcher and possibly a third baseman. They are still working to bring back Chase Headley to play third, and they want to bring back the starting pitcher Brandon McCarthy. Both, particularly McCarthy, did well after the Yankees acquired them in separate trades during the past season. But the Yankees are not dealing in a vacuum. Now that the Giants have lost Sandoval, they could join the competition for Headley. Giants Manager Bruce Bochy saw plenty of Headley as a minor leaguer, when Bochy was managing the Padres, and later, when Bochy was managing against Headley in the National League West, and is said to be a big fan of his. The Yankees like Headley but would be reluctant to get into a bidding war for him. If they do not sign a third baseman or trade for one, they have the option of moving Martin Prado to third and letting Rob Refsnyder and Jose Pirela, two minor league prospects, compete to become the everyday second baseman. It has been many years since the Yankees developed a good position player from their farm system, like Brett Gardner or Robinson Cano, and they would love to see either Pirela or Refsnyder break through. As with Headley, the Yankees also helped raise the value of McCarthy after they picked him up July 6. Once he joined the Yankees, they urged him to use his cut fastball more, and it led to his resurgence. He had a 5.01 earned run average last year with the Arizona Diamondbacks, and a 2.89 E.R.A. with the Yankees. Now many teams covet him. The Yankees are not currently pursuing any of the other big free-agent pitchers. Perhaps, if the asking prices change through the winter and the cost of signing one of them comes down significantly, they could revisit that stance. After all, there have been many times when the Yankees have jumped into a market when people did not expect them to.
