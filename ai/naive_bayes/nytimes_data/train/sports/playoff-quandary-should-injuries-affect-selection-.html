Playoff Quandary: Should Injuries Affect Selection? 
The selection committee for college football’s first top-tier playoff may be forced to choose between teams that had a great regular season before key injuries and those that are close to full strength.

OXFORD, Miss. — A Greek general won a battle against the Romans but sustained such heavy casualties, the story goes, that this general, whose name was Pyrrhus, caustically remarked that one more win like that one would be the end of him. Ohio State The Buckeyes capped the regular season on Saturday with  Still, the cost of the win may prove tremendous: Quarterback J. T. Barrett, who struggled early in the season after stepping in for the injured Braxton Miller but has been exceptional since, left in the fourth quarter with a season-ending ankle fracture. The sophomore Cardale Jones — who has attempted 19 passes in his college career, three of them against Michigan — is set to start for the Buckeyes when they play Wisconsin on Saturday in Indianapolis for the Big Ten championship. “I think it’s all going to be how we play next week,” Meyer said. Barrett’s injury was one in a series of tumultuous events. It began Friday as No. 8 U.C.L.A. lost at home to Stanford; continued early Saturday as No. 9 Georgia lost in overtime to No. 16 Georgia Tech; peaked Saturday night when the Iron Bowl turned into an uncharacteristic shootout, as No. 1 Alabama beat No. 15 Auburn, 55-44; and lapsed into Sunday as Nebraska fired Coach Bo Pelini, who had a 67-27 record in his seven-season tenure. The most significant game ended in  But the most intriguing situation might be Ohio State’s, because as challenging as Barrett’s injury is for the Buckeyes — whatever postseason game they end up in — it also makes for a quandary for the playoff’s 12-member selection committee: whether to reward Ohio State for a terrific regular season, or grant a semifinal berth to a team closer to full strength, one that may have a better chance of winning. No. 7 Baylor could be in a similar position. Quarterback Bryce Petty left Saturday’s game, a 48-46 win over lowly Texas Tech, with a mild concussion, according to the team. Petty told reporters he would play this weekend, against No. 12 Kansas State, but his status is not certain. That game will be one of the toughest of the year for Baylor, which is tied with the Wildcats and No. 5 Texas Christian atop the Big 12, a conference that does not have a championship game. The Ohio State team that will play Wisconsin on Saturday is, in a sense, not the same team that went 11-1, recording impressive road wins over Michigan State and Minnesota. To judge these new Buckeyes, the committee will have a sample size of one: the Big Ten title game. “The committee members review all pertinent information about every team each week,” said the playoff’s executive director, Bill Hancock, who does not have a vote. “Of course,” he added of Barrett, “this injury falls into that category.” Translation: Wait for the rankings. The next set will be released Tuesday evening, with the final one coming on Sunday. The top four teams picked by the committee will play in the semifinals, held on Jan. 1. The winners will play for the national title on Jan. 12 at AT&T; Stadium in Arlington, Tex. Other than Mississippi State, the undefeated and one-loss major-conference teams won their most recent games, giving them the clearest paths to the playoff. No. 2 Oregon took care of business at Oregon State, winning by 47-19 and getting another stellar performance (367 passing yards and six total touchdowns) from the Heisman Trophy candidate Marcus Mariota. No. 3 Florida State — the Football Bowl Subdivision’s only undefeated team now that Marshall lost to Western Kentucky on Friday — held off unranked Florida, 24-19. No. 5 T.C.U. demolished Texas, 48-10. This week’s schedule includes three important conference championship games that should make the playoff race much clearer: Oregon against No. 11 Arizona on Friday night in Santa Clara, Calif., in the Pacific-12 Conference; Alabama against No. 17 Missouri on Saturday afternoon in Atlanta in the Southeastern Conference; and Florida State against Georgia Tech on Saturday night in Charlotte, N.C., in the Atlantic Coast Conference. (The three underdogs should be ranked higher as of Tuesday.) The committee has looked favorably on Alabama, Oregon and Florida State, so it might feel similarly about a team that upset one of them (any of the three would have two losses in that case). Arizona will have an especially persuasive argument if it beats Oregon: The Wildcats performed well in the deep Pac-12, with regular-season wins over Utah (now No. 25), Arizona State (No. 13) and Oregon. That would leave Ohio State and Baylor battling with T.C.U., which will play Iowa State on Saturday, for what could be the playoff’s final spot. Losses by Ohio State and Baylor would allow the committee to ignore the Barrett and Petty issues, which could otherwise elicit arguments inside and outside the committee room. Rain or shine, injuries or no, the committee will speak with one voice when it announces the playoff bracket on Dec. 7. “What’s the phrase?” Oliver Luck, a committee member and West Virginia’s athletic director, asked in an interview before the committee began to release rankings. “Often wrong, never in doubt.”
