Green Bay Packers' Shareholder Fans Weigh In on N.F.L. Cases
Tens of thousands of Packers fans are shareholders in the team, making them in some ways a proxy for fans across the nation and the conscience of the N.F.L.

GREEN BAY, Wis. —  Since video was published in early September showing the former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out the woman who is now his wife, there has been a full-throated national debate about the  Women’s groups, advocates for victims of abuse, sportswriters and even some players have urged Commissioner  Yet most team owners have stayed mum or offered only timid comments and instead have let Goodell speak for them as he tries to repair the damage that has been done to the N.F.L.’s image, and to his own. When allowed to remain anonymous, owners have expressed support for Goodell, and they have noted that he has apologized for having initially been lenient with Rice and that he has since strengthened the league’s domestic violence policies. Steve Bisciotti of the Baltimore Ravens is one of the few to have spoken publicly. He  The owners of the  In some ways, Packers shareholders are a proxy for fans across the nation and are, broadly speaking, the conscience of the N.F.L. The team has a national following and a long, storied history in the league’s smallest market. And unlike the Dallas Cowboys, the Washington Redskins and other big-market teams, the Packers are without the imprint of a billionaire owner and a profit motive. Instead, they are run on behalf of their fans. Given the team’s unique structure, Mark Murphy hears often from the shareholders. As president of Green Bay Packers Incorporated, the nonprofit corporation that runs the team, he is more visible and accountable than the league’s 31 other owners. And in the past few weeks, he has received his share of letters and emails. Most of the correspondence has revolved around the team, which is 3-2. But domestic violence has come up, too. “It would be kind of disingenuous to say things were going well,” Murphy said on Thursday without a team spokesman at his elbow. “They’re concerned, but they’re glad the Packers haven’t had these kinds of situations.” Murphy said that Goodell had done many good things for the league but that he was also an easy target when things went wrong. He echoed other owners and fans when he said he hoped the league could move past the domestic violence crisis once the report on Goodell’s handling of Rice’s suspension was released, which could happen as soon as this week. “We’re all anxious to see the investigation completed by the owners’ meeting” in New York on Wednesday, he said. A few hours later, fans filled the streets around Lambeau Field before the Packers played the Minnesota Vikings. Shareholders, who were not hard to find, said the league had bungled the domestic violence cases, including one involving Adrian Peterson, a Minnesota Vikings running back who was arrested after being accused of beating his 4-year-old son with a stick. The Vikings suspended Peterson for one game, reinstated him and then suspended him again after an uproar. But Goodell has been unfairly pilloried, too, the shareholders said. Despite his missteps, Packers shareholders largely supported his decision last month, after the release of the graphic video, to suspend Rice indefinitely. “I don’t think it’s been handled well,” said Nathan Hinke, a shareholder and a former Division II college football player who was visiting from Los Angeles. “Ultimately, though, they got it right. If you hit a woman, it’s clear intent.” Janet Solberg, who drove from Milwaukee for the game, put it more succinctly. “I’m glad they’re coming down on players like that.” Still, several shareholders said the league should get out of the business of enforcing one-size-fits-all policies. That role should be filled by the teams, they said, because the teams are in a better position to get the message to players that crime does not pay. If a team terminates a player’s contract — which the Ravens ultimately did to Rice, albeit only after the video had been released — other players will know there are consequences. “The league can’t mandate every situation,” said Tony Parham, a shareholder from Dallas who used to work in Milwaukee. “It’s how you respond. The league can put in place penalties, but at the end of the day, it’s up to the owners to deal with it.” Ryan Menke, a shareholder who lives a few miles from Lambeau Field, said the N.F.L. and its teams should have long ago taken a tougher stance against players who committed domestic violence. But now, he said, the league has overcompensated. “I understand what they’ve done, but I think they’ve gone overboard,” Menke said, adding that Rice “is an employee of the Ravens.” He continued: “Why does the N.F.L. have to stick their beak in it? Now they’ve flipped the switch and gone from zero to 60.” Several shareholders confronted a more profound question: Why does Goodell feel the need to hold the N.F.L. and its players to a higher standard than society at large? Athletes, after all, are entertainers who play sports, not ethical beacons. “I don’t know about a higher standard, but humanity should take care of its own,” said Judy Savage Berndt, who stood with friends near a Packers-themed school bus called the Big Cheese. Close by, Scott Svacina, another shareholder, said Goodell had “put the hammer down” after initially underestimating the severity of the Rice case. But “do we really want the N.F.L. to set the moral obligations for our country?” he asked. “Those are high expectations for athletes. It’s unrealistic to expect that from them.”
