STANFORD, Calif. —  Amber Orrange made a go-ahead jumper with 1 minute 38 seconds left in overtime and the tying 3-pointer with 1.4 seconds remaining in regulation, sending No. 6 Stanford to an 88-86 victory against top-ranked Connecticut to end the Huskies’ 47-game winning streak Monday night. The host Cardinal ended another long run by the Huskies nearly four years after ending the program’s N.C.A.A.-record 90-game unbeaten run. UConn Lili Thompson scored 24 points, and Orrange had 17 for Stanford (2-0). Breanna Stewart scored 23 points and converted two free throws with 37.4 seconds left in regulation, and Saniya Chong had 20 for the Huskies (1-1). UConn looked out of sorts for much of the night at Maples Pavilion in a rematch of last season’s N.C.A.A. semifinal, and it did not help that Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis never got going. Mosqueda-Lewis, coming off a 30-point outing that included 10 3-pointers in the opener Friday at California, Davis, struggled all night to find her shot. She went without a field goal until she made a 3-pointer with 9:40 left in the game, having a tough time getting open looks against the swarming defense of Karlie Samuelson.
