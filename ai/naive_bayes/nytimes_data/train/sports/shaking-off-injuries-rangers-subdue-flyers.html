Shaking Off Injuries, Rangers Subdue Flyers
With two goals from Derick Brassard, and scores from J. T. Miller, Lee Stempniak and Jesper Fast, the Rangers claimed their 10th straight regular-season victory against the Flyers at Madison Square Garden.

Even before they took the ice Saturday for their home-and-home finale with the  The fourth-line winger Tanner Glass came down with the mumps and Dan Boyle missed the game with flulike symptoms. The Rangers announced afterward that Boyle was feeling better and would not specify if it was the viral infection circulating through the N.H.L. With Chris Kreider also absent after the death of his grandfather, the Rangers relied on some of their less-heralded players to pick up the slack. With two goals from Derick Brassard, and scores from J. T. Miller, Lee Stempniak and Jesper Fast, the Rangers claimed their 10th straight regular-season victory against the Flyers at Madison Square Garden, 5-2, on Saturday. Stempniak’s fifth goal of the season, an empty-net tally, sealed the Rangers’ 14th victory in their last 15 meetings against Philadelphia at the Garden, including last spring’s first-round playoff series, in which the Flyers won Game 2 in New York. Fast and Miller, who played together for Hartford in the American Hockey League, each assisted on the other’s goal and combined for six shots. It was Fast’s first goal in the N.H.L. “They played a real strong game,” Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault said. Miller, called up after Kreider learned about his grandfather’s death, posted the second multipoint game of his career — the other came on Feb. 7, 2013 against the Islanders — and scored his first goal of the season. “It’s nice to put one in every once in a while,” Miller said. “It was important to me, because it gave us a little cushion of a lead.” The Flyers, who have not won a regular-season game at the Garden since Feb. 20, 2011, fell behind for the 11th consecutive road game this season. After Claude Giroux was penalized for a double-minor high-sticking penalty a minute into the game, Brassard scored his seventh goal of the season. Displaying the same dominance they showed in two victories in the last nine days, the Rangers peppered Flyers goalie Ray Emery after Brassard’s score, putting the first eight shot on goal in the game. But even as the Rangers dominated on the shot clock, the Flyers tied the score at 1-1 on Nicklas Grosmann’s shot from the top of the circle at 13 minutes 46 seconds. Grossmann’s goal snapped a 149:14 scoreless stretch against the Rangers since Game 7 of last year’s playoff series. When Jakub Voracek’s power-play goal broke the deadlock at 8:45 of the second, the Flyers had their first lead at the Garden since Game 2. Making his first start at the Garden since last spring, Emery made 27 of his 30 saves in the first two periods. But Fast’s goal, a whistling shot past Emery’s blocker, tied the score and started another rash of offensive chances. “For maybe eight or nine minutes we lost momentum,” Vigneault said. “That line came back, scored the tying goal, and after that, I thought we had the momentum through the end of the second period.” Ultimately it was Brassard, the left-handed shooting center, who unlocked the tie. Kevin Hayes led a three-on-two breakout and Brassard walked in and snapped a shot past Emery’s stick, making it 3-2 at 3:06. Miller’s goal, in which he flew past Flyers defenseman Mark Streit, circled the goal and beat Emery on a wraparound gave the Rangers a two-goal advantage. Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist, who needed to make just 20 saves, stopped all nine he faced in the final 20 minutes. “We came out really confident in the third and kept playing the same way,” Lundqvist said. He added: “We played with a lot of speed and post support just like we did last night. It was great to see.”
