8:25 p.m. Eastern, NFL Network Line: Jaguars by 3 There are few matchups less appealing than this one, between two of the worst teams in the N.F.L. How it was chosen by the league to stand alone in prime time — even as both teams entered the season with little expectation of competitiveness — is a mystery. Blake Bortles, Jacksonville’s quarterback, is expected to play with a sprained right foot, but he still offers more potential than Charlie Whitehurst, Tennessee’s third-string quarterback. The result may hinge on whether the Jaguars can provide Bortles with time to throw. He has been sacked 46 times in 12 starts, with 19 coming in his last three games. “In college, you can run around and do more stuff,” Bortles said this week when asked about the sacks. “But in the N.F.L., guys are a lot faster and stronger. So it’s a little more difficult.” Tennessee is in the middle of the pack in terms of sacks, but its inability to stop the run could allow the mobile Bortles and a combination of Toby Gerhart, Jordan Todman and Storm Johnson to break open the game on the ground.
