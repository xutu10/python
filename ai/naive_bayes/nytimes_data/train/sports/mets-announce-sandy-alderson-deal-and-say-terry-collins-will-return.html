Mets Announce Sandy Alderson Deal and Say Terry Collins Will Return
Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson, who had his contract extended through 2017, said his top priority was to add 10 to 12 wins next season.

The  Then, almost in passing, Wilpon added, “He does have payroll flexibility, whether through free agency or trades.” Wilpon did not take any questions, and for about 15 minutes Alderson revealed bits and pieces about where he expected the Mets to go from here. In 2015, if Matt Harvey and David Wright return healthy, the Mets will be expected to contend for the postseason, and now Alderson had the authority to speak confidently about his plan. He did not get into specifics, however. He said he was unsure if the team’s payroll would drastically increase, but he also said he did not believe he would be “constrained” by it. For now, he said that he would be evaluating all of the Mets’ youngsters to determine if they were “playoff-caliber players.” He will then take those evaluations and compare them with players available on the free-agent and trade markets. Alderson said he had “plenty of latitude” to spend in each of those markets. Few of Alderson’s free-agent signings have panned out. This past off-season, he signed Chris Young to a one-year, $7.25 million deal, and Curtis Granderson to a four-year, $60 million deal to bolster the Mets’ offense. Young struggled mightily and was released midseason, although he has played well for the Yankees. Granderson has largely been a disappointment. “Free agency is a crapshoot,” Alderson said. “On the other hand, you expect to hit a certain number of times. That’s an area where we hopefully will continue to be active, but also more successful than perhaps we’ve been in the past.” Alderson said his top priority heading into the off-season was to add 10 to 12 wins next season. Unless the Mets finish on a hot streak, this will be their sixth consecutive losing season. Collins was hired as manager about a month after Alderson, in the fall of 2010. Alderson praised Collins’s energy and passion but confirmed that his option for 2016 had not been picked up, which means Collins could be managing the Mets next season with his future still very much in doubt. The expectations seem to be shifting within the organization. “I don’t think we’re that far away,” Alderson said. “I really don’t believe that this is going to take a giant leap to get to a playoff-competitive level.” He paused. “I hope I’m right about that.” INSIDE PITCH Tanner Roark allowed two runs and five hits in six and a third innings, and Adam LaRoche hit a three-run homer as the Nationals defeated the Mets, 4-2, in Washington. Bartolo Colon, who gave up four runs in six innings, took the loss. ... Jacob deGrom, a leading contender for the National League Rookie of the Year award, has been shut down for the season. Including his work in the minors, deGrom threw 1782/3 innings this year. In his 22 starts with the Mets, he compiled a 9-6 record and a 2.63 earned run average.
