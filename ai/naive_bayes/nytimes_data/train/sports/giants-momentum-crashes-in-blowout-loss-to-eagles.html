Victor Cruz’s Injury Is Final Insult for the Overmatched Giants
The good feelings surrounding the Giants evaporated in a 27-0 loss to the Eagles, a disheartening performance in which receiver Victor Cruz was most likely lost for the season with a knee injury.
===
PHILADELPHIA —  With a three-game winning streak, the Giants had robustly climbed back into the N.F.C. East race. The sturdy Giants had built credibility, displayed unity and resilience, and proved that their new offensive system could operate successfully. Then they went to Philadelphia. By the end of a 27-0 loss Sunday night, the Giants (3-3) no longer had a winning record; their newly revamped offensive line allowed  It was a staggering collective loss and the thoroughness of the rout also made the Giants seem unprepared, or underskilled, for the high echelon of play displayed by the defending division champion  The Giants were virtually never in the game, falling behind by 10 points in the opening quarter and 20 at halftime. “We got outplayed, and they were the more physical team,” Manning said. “It was a good reminder. You can’t just show up on the field and expect things to go your way automatically.” Of Cruz’s injury, Manning said: “You never want to see a guy go down. It’s tough, especially for a buddy of mine.” Cruz was injured at the end of the one sequence when the Giants threatened a serious rally. Trailing by 20-0, the Giants had the ball at the Eagles’ 21-yard line after a third-quarter interception by cornerback Zack Bowman. The Giants soon had a first down at the 7, but after three plays were no closer to the end zone than the 3-yard line. Going for it on fourth down, Manning lofted a pass to the right corner of the end zone for Cruz, who twisted his body to get in position to make the catch. Cruz’s right knee buckled slightly as he went for the pass and the ball caromed off his hands for an incompletion. Cruz grabbed his right knee before he hit the turf and remained on the field until he was lifted into a cart and wheeled from the field. He was surrounded players from both teams and was later admitted to a Philadelphia hospital. The team said he would return to New Jersey on Monday. Cruz, a team captain and one of the team’s most popular players, is a stalwart of the Giants’ passing attack. While the rookie Odell Beckham Jr. has shown promise and the third-year wide receiver Rueben Randle has improved this season, Cruz has been the veteran presence and is Manning’s most trusted and productive receiver. “It’s a huge loss,”  Cruz’s injury clearly demoralized the Giants, who stumbled through a lifeless, scoreless final quarter. While the Giants had more energy earlier in the game, they were no more productive. The Eagles dominated from the beginning as their offensive line opened gaping holes for LeSean McCoy. The Giants were often in a nickel defense, which only made it easier for the Eagles run the football. Eagles quarterback Nick Foles was also attacking the middle of the Giants’ secondary effectively with short passes. The Eagles’ first drive stalled inside the Giants 20-yard line, but Philadelphia still able to convert a 31-yard field goal by Cody Parkey. On its next possession, Philadelphia was operating its offense at a frantic pace and the Giants struggled to keep up. McCoy burst through large holes and Foles found a variety of receivers, primarily on crossing routes. The Giants were consistently a step behind and soon the Eagles were in scoring position again. Foles lofted a perfect pass to the right edge of the end zone where Zach Ertz dove to his left to make a 15-yard touchdown reception. Ertz was covered tightly by cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, but Foles’s pass was placed where only Ertz could catch the ball. Offensively, the Giants looked even more overwhelmed than they did defensively. In the first half, they had trouble getting their plays off before the play clock expired, once having to call a timeout and another time receiving a delay-of-game penalty. Worse for the Giants, the offensive line could not handle the Philadelphia pass rush. Time and again, Manning was hurried in the pocket — he was sacked six times — and he rarely had room to step into his throws. Right tackle Justin Pugh missed blocks on two of the three sacks. “Words can’t describe how badly I played,” Pugh said. “It felt like everything was going wrong.” The Giants were also committing a host of penalties, which disrupted their offensive rhythm. By early in the second quarter, with the Eagles ahead by 10-0, McCoy’s elusive rushing had Philadelphia in scoring position again. From the Giants’ 26-yard line, Foles dropped back to pass and no one in the Giants secondary bothered to cover tight end James Casey, who streaked across the middle of the field. Foles made the easy toss to the wide-open Casey, who caught the ball at about the 5 line and trotted into the end zone to give the Eagles a 17-0 lead. After a 43-yard punt return by Darren Sproles — the punt was not angled away from the speedy Sproles but was instead kicked down the middle of the field — the Eagles added a 45-yard Parkey field goal to go ahead, 20-0. Late in the second quarter, the Eagles got good field position after Chris Maragos partially blocked a punt by the Giants’ Steve Weatherford. Philadelphia moved swiftly down the field and was soon inside the Giants 20. But Giants safety Antrel Rolle intercepted a poorly thrown Foles pass. The Giants’ offense could not capitalize on the turnover. Any momentum the Giants might have built was undone by a holding penalty on Pugh and yet another sack of Manning. Minutes after Cruz’s injury, the Eagles added another touchdown when Sproles raced into the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown run. EXTRA POINTS Giants cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie left the game in the first half with back spasms and did not return.
