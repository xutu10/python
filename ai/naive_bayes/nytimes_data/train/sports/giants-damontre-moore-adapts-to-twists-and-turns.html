Giants' Damontre Moore Adapts to Twists and Turns

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —  Until he was 14, Damontre Moore had lived most of his life in a hardscrabble, rough-edged Dallas neighborhood. Then his mother boldly moved the family to a leafy suburb 35 miles to the northeast. “It was completely my mom’s idea, and I hated it,” Moore, a second-year Giants defensive end and prospective rising star, said Friday. “I went from a predominantly black area to a community that was predominantly Caucasian. I went from a place where fighting in school was almost an everyday thing to a place where getting in a fight got you suspended and sent to an alternative school. “I felt so out of place, and I told my mom over and over I didn’t want to be out there.” Moore’s mother, Detra Johnson, who was 32 at the time, had been determined since Damontre’s birth to get her son out of the inner-city neighborhood where she and Damontre’s father had been raised. “I wanted him to be well-rounded; I wanted him to go to school and play sports with everybody, not just black people,” Johnson said. “The country, the business world and college campuses are a mix of people, and I wanted him to fit in wherever he went.” For Moore, the adjustment to a new city and school, Rowlett High, was not always easy. “Lots of different rules and new things to learn,” Moore said. “Total culture shock.” His sports career would also have to wait. As a 6-foot-4 freshman, he was a big, talented athlete, but he would not play a varsity football game until he was a junior, and then he was not a starter. It has been eight years since Moore and his mother left Dallas. Last week at Rowlett High, where Moore is known as Tre, the teachers were circulating a web link to the N.F.L.’s Pro Bowl voting, because Moore is on the ballot as a special-teams player. “Everybody here loves Tre,” Rowlett’s assistant principal, Shae Creel, said. “He was a kid who got people to smile. A good, fun-loving kid and we’re very proud of him.” On Friday, Moore sat outside the Giants’ locker room absorbing what had been a whirlwind week. It began at a news conference on Monday, with the Giants’ general manager, Jerry Reese, publicly lobbying the coaches to get Moore on the field more often. “Good things seem to happen when he’s out there,” Reese said. Not surprisingly, in subsequent days Giants coaches indicated that Moore would most likely have a significant role in Monday night’s game against Indianapolis. But the reflective, if loquacious, Moore was still ruminating about his mother’s determined decision making when he was a young teenager. “She worked as a medical assistant and had a second job taking care of at-home patients so I could afford what I needed at the time,” Moore said. “When I complained about the move, she told me I would thank her later. And after a year or so I told her that she was right and I appreciated everything she did. “There were so many new opportunities. The move opened up my eyes to all the places I could go. It wasn’t the only thing, but it was a big step.” It was one of several noteworthy steps for a promising N.F.L. player who turned all of 22 less than two months ago. Moore never lived with both his parents. “They were never together but they were always on the same page when it came to doing what’s best for me,” Moore said. “I spent weekends with my dad and lived with him for longer periods sometimes. I think my mom wanted to make sure I learned things from him, too. And he opened up my eyes to the arts and music.” In the Giants’ locker room, or in the weight room, Moore is the player who is often found singing or dancing; he also can be counted on for a prank or two. “My dad made me join a choir because he knew I wanted to sing in public but wasn’t going to do it on my own,” Moore said of his father, Damon Moore. “He encouraged me to develop my creative side and introduced me to origami. I spent a lot of enjoyable hours doing that. There were many little lessons. “After games, we didn’t have the money to go out to dinner like the other kids. Some of them offered to pay for my dinner, and my dad was the one that taught me to accept their offer once and that’s it. He said, ‘Don’t take handouts. Work hard so you can pay your own way.’ ” Eventually Moore earned a starting job at Rowlett, but he was recruited by college teams almost by accident. A Texas A&M; coach was watching video of Rowlett’s wide receiver, Marquise Goodwin, who is now with the Buffalo Bills. “All of a sudden, the coach saw Tre chase down someone from sideline to sideline,” Creel, the assistant principal, said. “He said, ‘I want to know about that tall kid who can run like that.’ ” At Texas A&M;, Moore quickly became a star, playing with the future N.F.L. star Von Miller, whose parents, Gloria and Von Sr., became surrogates while he was on the A&M; campus. “We told Damontre’s mom, ‘Don’t worry about him being away from home — you’ve got another set of eyes down here,’ ” Von Miller Sr. said. Moore was arrested and accused of marijuana possession the summer before his sophomore season. “I felt terrible for making such a mistake,” Moore said. “I felt bad having to tell my coaches, but I was terrified to tell my mom.” Detra Johnson had been strict in raising her son, forbidding him, for example, to wear tattoos or an earring. “I promised my mom that I would learn from what I did wrong and become the mature person she wanted me to be,” Moore said. Said Johnson: “The thing about Damontre is that he was always the youngest in his group — he graduated from high school at 17, left college at 20 — but he was also usually the biggest in his group, and because of that people treated him like he was the oldest. But he was still just a kid.” There have been no significant or embarrassing off-the-field episodes since. “Damontre was a smart, good kid,” Von Miller Sr. said. “He just needed better judgment, some advice and time to grow.” After three productive college seasons, and 26.5 sacks, Moore decided to turn professional. He was at first considered a top-five pick in the 2013 N.F.L. draft, but at the combine he ran one of the slowest times for a defensive end in the 40-yard dash, surprising for a player who had shown plenty of speed at Texas A&M.; In the bench-press test he again lagged far behind the top prospects. Moore became the poster boy for talented players who squandered their opportunities by not staying in shape for the combine. Alarm bells sounded around the N.F.L., and Moore dropped precipitously in the draft rankings. “Again, just maturity. He didn’t take care of business like he was supposed to do,” Miller said. “Another life lesson.” Moore was at the Millers’ house on the first day of the draft, as the first and second rounds went by without his name being called. “I turned off the TV and left the room crying,” Moore said. “I was so mad I couldn’t see.” The Giants took him in the third round, the 81st overall pick. “My mom told me that God does everything for a reason,” Moore said. “I just had to prove myself again.” Moore got a tattoo over his right rib cage; a blue poker chip with an 81 inside it. “It means that I went 81st but I’m really a blue-chip prospect,” Moore said. “I got it in the most painful place to get a tattoo because I wanted it to be a painful reminder.” Moore’s journey as a Giant has not been all smooth sailing. In his rookie year, he flashed his pass rushing capabilities and blocked a punt. As Reese noted, he seemed to create a degree of havoc in the opposing team’s backfield, but the Giants’ coaches said they could not count on Moore to consistently stick to his run-stopping assignments. He also had a shoulder injury that limited his playing time except on special teams, where he continued to excel. Moore has played more this season, but he is still a reserve. That could change this week. With the Giants’ defensive line depleted by injuries, Moore’s chance to shine could well be against the pass-happy Colts. “He’s going to be in the playing rotation,” Coach  Moore said it had been difficult to remain patient. “But I’ve learned that things aren’t always what they seem and sometimes you have to wait to see what’s good for you,” he said. “I don’t mind. When I get out there and do what I can do, the surprise will be even greater. I like when I’m surprised by life.” Moore’s mother, who moved her son against his wishes, sees the twists and turns of the last eight years as self-fulfilling. “He’s exactly where he’s supposed to be,” Detra Johnson said. “It’s like other parts of life, doing the right thing isn’t always easy. But he’s with a nurturing organization and they know what they have. “I’m not worried. You’ll see, he’ll be O.K.”
