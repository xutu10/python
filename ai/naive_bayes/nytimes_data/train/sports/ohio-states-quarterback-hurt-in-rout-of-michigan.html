Ohio State’s Quarterback Hurt in Rout of Michigan
No. 6 Ohio State beat rival Michigan but the Buckeyes’ more pressing issue was J. T. Barrett’s health and how that affected their chances to qualify for the College Football Playoff.

COLUMBUS, Ohio —  J. T. Barrett lay flat on his back, looking up at the sky, his arms spread wide, and Ohio Stadium watched in silence as  Michigan quarterback Devin Gardner came over to check on Barrett, an air cast was placed on Barrett’s leg and he was carted off the field. He has a broken right ankle and will miss the rest of the season. Barrett, a redshirt freshman, had emerged as a Heisman Trophy contender. He has been the engineer of Coach Urban Meyer’s spread offense. Earlier in the game, he had broken the Big Ten record set by Drew Brees for most touchdowns in a season with his 43rd. No. 6 Ohio State held on to beat rival Michigan, 42-28, but the Buckeyes’ more pressing issue was Barrett’s health and how that affected their chances to qualify for the College Football Playoff. They have one more game — the Big Ten championship game next week — to perhaps prove they can win without him. For Michigan, this was a gut-wrenching end to a disastrous season. As linebacker Jake Ryan put it: A new distraction seemed to pop up each week. There was a concussion scandal and a domestic violence case involving a star player. Dave Brandon, the athletic director, resigned amid pressure from alumni, students and fans. And Michigan Coach Brady Hoke may follow Brandon out. Every morning on his way in to work at the Michigan football building, Hoke would walk past a bronze statue of one of his heroes, the former coach Bo Schembechler. Sometimes, lately, Hoke would think to himself: Bo, are we messing this up? When Hoke was hired in 2011, he said he would have walked to Ann Arbor; this was his dream job. He had coached under Lloyd Carr and considered Schembechler a friend. Those close to him say he is fiercely loyal, almost to a fault. He is still a defensive line coach at heart. So through all the turmoil, he did not campaign for himself. At his weekly news conference Monday, Hoke declined to make one last case to keep his job. He preferred to keep those conversations private, at least for now. “We’ll have another press conference, I’ve got a feeling, sometime here,” he said. After Hoke left the lectern, though, Greg Mattison, his defensive coordinator and close friend, delivered an impassioned speech for more than four and a half minutes arguing why Hoke should keep his job. He noted how every senior had graduated under Hoke. He suggested four years was not enough time to build a program. “I’ve done this a long time,” Mattison said. “I’ve been with a lot of head coaches, seen a lot of them. You don’t know how lucky you are here. Just telling you that.” Michigan started Saturday’s game with inspired play. On his first pass, Gardner threw an ugly interception that eventually led to an Ohio State touchdown. But on two of the next three possessions, Gardner led Michigan on long touchdown drives — of 80 and 95 yards. He threw his first road touchdown pass of the season and scrambled for two key first downs. But Barrett, Ohio State’s young quarterback, was searching for a rhythm. Three consecutive drives stalled on him. Barrett had been thrust into the spotlight only just before the season, when Braxton Miller sustained a torn labrum in his right shoulder. Miller had been considered a Heisman Trophy contender. But Barrett proved to be a better passer, more dangerous in Meyer’s offense and a Heisman contender in his own right. Just before halftime, Barrett dropped back, pump-faked, scampered upfield and wove his way for a 25-yard touchdown, tying the game, 14-14. To start the second half, he showed his touch on a 52-yard pass to set up another touchdown run. Then he led a 14-play touchdown drive that gave Ohio State a 28-21 lead. Ohio State had regained control to start the fourth quarter when Barrett faked a handoff and was swarmed by Michigan defenders. His right leg appeared to be caught at an awkward angle. An official offered to help him up, but he stayed down. Cardale Jones took over at quarterback, but he was not necessarily needed. Ezekiel Elliott, the Ohio State running back, broke one tackle and otherwise ran untouched on a 44-yard touchdown. And Joey Bosa, the defensive end, sacked Gardner and forced a fumble that was returned for a touchdown.
