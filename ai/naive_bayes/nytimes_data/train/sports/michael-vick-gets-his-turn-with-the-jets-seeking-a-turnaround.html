Michael Vick Gets His Turn With the Jets Seeking a Turnaround
After taking over the reins from Geno Smith as the Jets’ starting quarterback, Vick has to go up against a Chiefs team led by Andy Reid.

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. —  Michael Vick spent the last seven months with the Jets waiting, watching, practicing, reviewing film, mentoring, suffering, waiting, holding clipboards, working with the scout team, suffering some more and waiting some more for an opportunity that he hoped would come while never knowing if it would. “I wanted to help in some way,” Vick said. Now he can. His first task, should he choose to accept it, is to restore credibility to a team seemingly beyond reclamation and functionality to a position marred by poor decision-making and worse throws. Vick’s first day as the starting quarterback felt like a normal Wednesday, Coach Rex Ryan said. No extra enthusiasm or energy radiated from the practice as Vick worked with the first-team offense for the first time, no additional sense of competence. It is just as well because at this stage, the 1-7 Jets would take normal. They would take boring. They would sleep upside-down like bats if it meant they would win at Kansas City on Sunday. The Jets have lost seven straight, and Vick could represent their best chance to reclaim some dignity. Support in the locker room had eroded for Geno Smith, who threw interceptions on three straight drives in Sunday’s 43-23 loss to Buffalo before Vick replaced him late in the first quarter. “I don’t think this is the last of me playing,” Smith said, adding of Vick: “If he’s giving us the best chance to win games, then he should be the starter. I’m going to fully support Mike just like he did for me.” Vick led the Jets to three touchdown drives — including their final series, when they were trailing by 26 points — and moved the offense, making some well-timed throws and using his speed and his elusiveness to escape the pocket, with eight rushes for 69 yards. He also threw an interception, was sacked four times and lost two of his four fumbles. When he went home, Vick said, he thought a lot about those fumbles. “Last week, I got greedy,” Vick said. “I was trying to play like a 24-year-old Mike Vick.” He has not been a 24-year-old Mike Vick in 10 years. The 34-year-old Mike Vick is still swift — “He’s going to be 50 years old and still be the fastest guy on the field and the best arm on the field,” said Chiefs Coach Andy Reid, who coached him for four seasons in Philadelphia — but he knows he must play with more control and discipline. In a conversation this week, Ryan told Vick that his ball security had to improve. “Trying to get that second and third yard is not always going to be the best benefit,” Vick said. “I think I try to do too much at times. That’s when things get out of hand.” The Chiefs present an interesting challenge for Vick and the Jets. The teams run similar schemes. The Jets’ offensive coordinator, Marty Mornhinweg, coached 10 seasons in Philadelphia under Reid. The Chiefs’ defensive coordinator, Bob Sutton, coached four seasons under Ryan, and he oversees a group headlined by the edge rushers Tamba Hali and Justin Houston that ranks third in the N.F.L. in both scoring and total defense. “A lot like Rex’s defense,” Jets guard Willie Colon said. Vick has seen Ryan’s defense daily at practice, and he saw Sutton’s in Week 3 last season, when he threw two interceptions in an Eagles loss. Vick did not dispute the notion that Reid’s familiarity with him could give the Chiefs an advantage. “If there is anybody who knows me, it’s him,” Vick said. “There have been times that he has sat there and told me what he would do if he played me and what other teams were going to do. And they did exactly just that.” Reid played down that benefit. “You never slight Michael Vick,” he said.
