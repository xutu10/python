History-Making Medal? For Mikaela Shiffrin, It’s a Start
After winning Olympic gold in the slalom in 2012, Shiffrin is training to take on other Alpine disciplines with the same fervor.

It has been eight months since 18-year-old Mikaela Shiffrin stood atop the medal podium at the Sochi Winter Games as the youngest Olympic slalom champion in history. With a new ski racing season beginning Saturday in Sölden, Austria, Shiffrin was asked how her life had changed since she won the gold medal. “I can’t just walk outside; I have to be more aware how I look,” Shiffrin, now 19, answered with a laugh. “I’ve learned some quick tricks about how to fix my hair so I can dash somewhere unexpected and still be O.K. when someone stops me to take a picture.” She added: “That probably sounds really shallow. But people tell me an Olympic medal is a life-changing event. Except I don’t even think about the medal unless someone asks about it.” If Shiffrin is not dwelling on her groundbreaking triumph in Sochi, there is good reason. She is adamant that she is just getting started. “It was a huge accomplishment,” she said in a lengthy interview last month. “But if that’s the only thing I’m going to do in life, I’m really going to be disappointed in myself.” There is a long-term plan, and while it has no specific month-by-month timetable, it nonetheless includes winning a World Cup overall title “as soon as possible — even if it takes a ton of work.” Shiffrin wants to race in the Olympics until at least 2022. Soon, she expects to branch out to the riskier Alpine speed events of super-G and downhill. Shiffrin also wants to use her burgeoning fame to make an impact beyond ski racing. “People watch the Olympics because they want to believe in heroes; I know I did,” Shiffrin said. “But it has to have value other than just carrying a medal around your neck, because anybody can do that. I want to turn it into something bigger, something more meaningful to more people.” Then she acknowledged: “I don’t know what that would be, since I’ve got so many scattered thoughts in my head. But there are so many possibilities, and who wants to waste that opportunity?” Shiffrin’s immediate focus is trying to conquer her second-best Alpine event, the giant slalom. But Shiffrin has also begun training for the less technical and more treacherous speed events of super-G and downhill. In a significant step, Shiffrin expects to compete in some super-G events this season, beginning with lower-level races in November so she can qualify for World Cup super-G races in January. But as is typical of Shiffrin’s renowned thirst for perfection, she does not plan to enter her first super-G race until she feels she has a chance to win. “I’m not necessarily saying that I should win, but for that first speed race, whether people are expecting it or not, when I get in the start gate I’m going for the podium,” she said. “Definitely don’t write me off there. “It’s going to take practice, and it won’t be easy by any means. But I’m going to prepare so that everyone knows that the podium is what I’m going for.” Roland Pfeifer, the United States ski team’s women’s technical coach and a former top Austrian coach, is confident Shiffrin will make the transition. “She will be a good speed skier,” Pfeifer said. “She knows how to glide. But right now, it’s more important that she continue to develop her high level of slalom and giant slalom skiing.” As dominant as Shiffrin was in the slalom during the last two seasons, she has made the podium in ski racing’s other technical event, the giant slalom, only twice. In the Olympics, she finished fifth. Determined to improve her giant slalom technique, Shiffrin spent five weeks training in New Zealand. She was particularly eager to channel the almost revolutionary tactics of Ted Ligety, the American who is the Olympic and world giant slalom champion. “Ted is one of the only people whose World Cup race videos I study,” Shiffrin said. “He has such a distinct and obvious style. Each time you race and you don’t do what he does, you are getting slower. You feel like hitting yourself over the head with a hammer. Because it’s so clear what he’s doing, but at the same time it’s so very hard to replicate. “I keep trying to fit what he’s doing into a young girl’s body.” The improvements in giant slalom will have to come while Shiffrin also finds training time to maintain her technique in slalom, which requires a finely tuned rhythm acquired by rote. An almost contrary challenge will be learning to be comfortable at the higher speeds necessary on the unpredictable terrain of a super-G course. “And there’s a lot of good girls out there competing against me,” Shiffrin said. “So it’ll take a lot of work. But I don’t feel rushed or pressured. I have all these things I want to do, but I don’t have to do them right away. Because it’s not just about winning; it’s about succeeding, which to me are two different things.” Hours after winning the slalom gold medal late on a Friday night at Sochi, Shiffrin was asked what she wanted to accomplish at her next Olympics. “Five gold medals,” she said. That would require a victory in every Alpine event. No one has won more than three Alpine gold medals in one Olympics. Last month, Shiffrin faintly mocked her five-gold-medal projection. “That’s one of those crazy things I say at 3 a.m. after winning an Olympic medal,” she said. “You shouldn’t hold me to anything I say in those circumstances.” But Shiffrin, perhaps the nascent queen of a new generation of ski racing stars, added another thought. “I’m not afraid of ambition,” she said. “I like to dream about the things nobody else would think is possible. That’s what inspires me.”
