Two Jets, Two Friends, Together Through Life and Through Football
Darrin Walls and Rontez Miles were friends and teammates playing football in high school, and now with the Jets.
===
FLORHAM PARK, N.J. —   Darrin Walls, tall and sinewy, a marvel with the ball. Across the line of scrimmage Rontez Miles, a dervish on defense, even at age 10. See ball, get ball, that is what Miles did. With time running out, Miles’s Braddock Falcons led Walls’s Garfield Gators by a point. Walls lined up at tight end, cleared the linebackers and caught the game-winning touchdown pass. That was the last time the boys saw each other until high school, at Woodland Hills. The school serves some depressed mill towns on the Monongahela River, some nice towns, some in-between towns. Miles grew up in one of those depressed mill towns, Braddock, Pa. His mother was an addict. His father was incarcerated. He bounced among friends’ and relatives’ homes. Walls, five months older and a grade ahead, moved into one of those nice towns, Churchill, Pa. His parents divorced when he was young. His childhood, apart from that, was stable. No matter where his players came from, George Novak coached them the same. He started in 1987, when Woodland Hills was created in a merger, and never left. Up front he tells them that  Steve Breaston and Rob Gronkowski, Ryan Mundy and Lousaka Polite, Shawntae Spencer and Jason Taylor, N.F.L. players all — they sat and listened to Novak. So did Walls. So did Miles. “I always knew that he would go and I would go,” Miles said of Walls, his teammate then and now, with  Two teenagers from Pittsburgh stood on a football field. It was uneven, lumpy, at the bottom of a large hill. This is where the Woodland Hills Wolverines practiced for a chunk of every August, escaping the temptations and distractions of home for woodsy New Florence, Pa., about 50 miles east, and Camp Twin Echo. Novak outlawed cellphones, radios, personal entertainment systems. “Two weeks, nobody but us,” Miles said. The team worked out three times daily, twice in full pads. They lifted weights. Did conditioning drills. Then they collapsed in their cabins and did it all again the next day. Freshmen rarely went to Twin Echo because they rarely made the varsity. Walls went to Twin Echo as a freshman. One of his first games, late in a blowout victory, he rumbled about 50 yards for a touchdown. He started as a sophomore and starred on offense and on defense as a junior, when Miles joined him in the secondary. Walls played cornerback, Miles safety. Their playing styles reflected their personalities. Miles talked big and hit bigger. He did not welcome contact, he pursued it. “He was always around the ball,” Walls said. Walls zipped past defenders and silenced receivers. He was so quiet, so unassuming, it seems plausible that he apologized to them afterward. “He was a highlight film waiting to happen,” Miles said. Heading into his senior year, Walls was considered the top cornerback prospect in the country. And yet. “I honestly thought he was going to play offense in college,” Miles said. “Yeah, me too,” Walls said. Colleges disagreed. Scholarships piled up. Friends called him Five Star. His success benefited his teammates. The more coaches arrived to watch him, the more they noticed everybody else. Two teenagers from Pittsburgh stood on a football field. Not just any football field. The football field downtown — Heinz Field, the Steelers’ glittering stadium on Pittsburgh’s North Shore. On this frigid November night in 2005, Woodland Hills played its rival McKeesport for a berth in the Class AAAA quarterfinals. Before running onto the field, Walls and Miles slapped the sign above the locker room door. It accompanied the team to every game: To Achieve You Must Endure. During stretching, a trainer walked among the players, carrying a bucket containing grass from the Wolverines’ field. Each player took a handful and sprinkled it by his feet. Walls dislocated his right shoulder before the season and aggravated the injury in mid-September. It restricted his availability on defense, not on offense. Trailing by 19-7 in the second half, after Miles made a diving interception, Woodland Hills called a deep pass for Walls. Running a post route, he split the cornerback and safety. He was open at the 10-yard line. The pass was flawless. He dropped it. “I never saw him drop passes like that, especially that easy,” Miles said. “Yeah, it should have been a touchdown,” Walls said Around school, they saw each other. In study hall, where they sat next to each other. On the basketball court, too. They did not play, though. They danced. At halftime they performed hip-hop routines. About 15 of them. They wore matching blue jeans and black T-shirts. They called themselves the Showstoppers. “Everyone was like, ‘How are you going to be a big, bad football player, all mean, and then come out and dance?’ ” Miles said. “Rontez can really dance, though,” Walls said. Walls could, too. He was just more understated. As was his Last Will and Testament, published in the school yearbook. Instead of bequeathing inside jokes or fond memories, Walls left his “strength and leadership to the upcoming stars in the football program.” What Walls left, Miles grabbed. No men from Pittsburgh stood on a football field. This was 2008. Before his junior season at Notre Dame, Walls was suspended for violating the university’s honor code by improperly citing sources in a paper. He went home. He worked in a pharmaceutical warehouse, attended community college and plotted his return. The N.F.L.? All he wanted was to play again. And get that degree from Notre Dame. Through a mutual friend, Miles heard about Walls’s suspension. But he thought it would be awkward, after two years without seeing him, to call or text. Besides, he was dealing with his own problems. When they were boys, Miles and his half brother, Vondre Griffin, born two months apart, made a pact. They would go to college together. They would play football together. They would reach the N.F.L. together. Whenever Griffin was around, Miles felt more comfortable, immune from the troubles at home or the teasing he absorbed for having  Miles, one of the best safeties ever to play for Novak, had offers from universities like Arizona, Colorado, Pittsburgh and West Virginia. Griffin, a quarterback, did not. For Miles, loyalty superseded power-conference college football. Kent State wanted them both, so that was where they went. They did not last long. As Miles worked to qualify academically, Griffin, facing charges of marijuana possession and driving without a license, was kicked off the team. Miles left with him. That is what family did. “We were each other’s crutch,” Miles said. “Some people think that’s a weakness I have. I’m too loyal, maybe. That’s just who I am.” He spent two years at community college raising his grades before enrolling at Division II California University of Pennsylvania. There he became such a dynamo that teammates, in a nod to Steelers safety Troy Polamalu, gave Miles a fake ponytail. Before his senior season, on Aug. 5, 2012, Miles received a call. Griffin had shot a man to death. According to  “You’ve got two guys like us who are close, you think we’re two peas in a pod,” Miles said. “You probably think I’m dangerous or something.” That is what coaches at the 2013 N.F.L. scouting combine wanted to know. They prodded him about his relationship with Griffin when they were not asking about the Steelers logo tattooed on his left arm. If we draft you, Miles was asked, how would you react when playing against the Steelers? At least Miles was asked these questions. Two years earlier, Walls never had the chance. He was not invited to the combine. Nor, like Miles, was he drafted. To achieve you must endure. Two men from Pittsburgh stood on a football field in New Jersey.  The grass was lush, and it crinkled underfoot as they ran to catch passes. The last time they were teammates, Miles and Walls wore blue helmets. Now they wear white. Walls, 26, is a Jets cornerback, working every day to strengthen a weakened secondary. Miles, 25, is on the practice squad, working every day to earn a promotion. It is crazy, they say, that they both wound up here, together. The day they were reunited, in May 2013, they saw each other in the Jets’ headquarters and started laughing. That still happens. At practice Wednesday, a pass caromed off Walls’s hands. An unmistakable voice called out from behind Miles’s face mask. “Same stuff in high school,” Miles said.
