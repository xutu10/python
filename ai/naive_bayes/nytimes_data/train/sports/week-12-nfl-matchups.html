Week 12 N.F.L. Matchups
This week’s games feature a test for the Cardinals, who have been snubbed by the oddsmakers against the Seahawks despite their superior record.
===
Cardinals 4:05 p.m. Sunday Line: Seahawks by 6 ½ If someone had predicted before the season that one of these teams would be 9-1 going into this game, most people would have bet the mortgage that Seattle would have that record. But Arizona and Coach Bruce Arians are still finding ways to win, seemingly with duct tape and glue. By this point in the season, one would think that oddsmakers would show the Cardinals a little more respect for having the N.F.L.'s best record and not make them underdogs against any team with three fewer wins — even the defending Super Bowl champions playing at home. The snub did not seem to surprise Arians. “Going up there, everybody is usually an underdog,” Arians said. “We don’t really need any more extra motivation to go play them, especially at their place. They’re the world champions. We’re just 9-1.” If the Cardinals can pull out a victory in Seattle — which they did in Week 16 last season — it would put them four games ahead of the Seahawks in the N.F.C. West with five to play. Pick: Seahawks Lions 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Patriots by 7 It’s doubtful that many casual football fans knew the name Jonas Gray before last Sunday. But after rushing for 199 yards and four touchdowns for New England against Indianapolis, he is on the cover of the Nov. 24 edition of Sports Illustrated. Before the N.F.L., Gray tried his hand at comedy, once opening for Dustin Diamond, a ka Screech from “Saved by the Bell.” “Back in the day, I called myself a funny guy and did a little stand-up,” Gray said. “I was pretty successful at it here and there. Booed off stage a few times.” Almost as interesting as Gray’s stand-up comedy past: The Patriots have won 13 straight against N.F.C. North teams, the longest current streak by a team against another division. Pick: Patriots Browns (6-4) at Falcons (4-6) 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Falcons by 3 ½ It’s a good week to be Josh Gordon, who led the N.F.L. in receiving yards in 2013 in just 14 games for Cleveland and served a 10-game suspension this season. He can leave his job as a car salesman in the rearview mirror and return to the field against Atlanta’s pass defense, ranked last in the N.F.L. Talking about his return, Gordon boldly proclaimed, “I’m going to tear this league up.” It’s a bad week to be a member of the Falcons’ secondary. “He’s a guy that with the ball in his hands, he can make plays,” Atlanta Coach Mike Smith said. “So we’re anticipating that we’re going to get a full dose of him.” Pick: Browns Dolphins (6-4) at Broncos (7-3) 4:25 p.m. Sunday Line: Broncos by 7 ½ If the season ended today, Miami would just miss the playoffs as the seventh seed in the A.F.C. But the Dolphins appear to be surging and in control of their destiny. It won’t be easy, however, with games against the Patriots and the Ravens on the horizon after this game in Denver, where the Broncos have not lost in 2014. Denver looks far from unbeatable, though, especially with Peyton Manning looking not all that much like Peyton Manning lately, throwing two interceptions in three consecutive games. Still, Dolphins cornerback Cortland Finnegan is not expecting to have an easy time of it. “Peyton Manning is Peyton Manning,” Finnegan said. “He’s going to move the football.” Pick: Broncos Titans (2-8) at Eagles (7-3) 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Eagles by 11 The last time Mark Sanchez started a game against Tennessee, he tossed four interceptions and completed 13 of 28 passes for 131 yards. In Week 11, Sanchez turned the ball over four times — including an interception that was returned for a touchdown — against the Packers in Green Bay. No wonder Chip Kelly may be rushing Nick Foles back onto the field. Pick: Eagles Cowboys (7-3) at Giants (3-7) 8:30 p.m. Sunday Line: Cowboys by 3 ½ Remember in 2009 when Eli Manning brazenly  Pick: Cowboys Packers (7-3) at Vikings (4-6) 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Packers by 10 It’s good that the Vikings are now playing outdoors during what is shaping up to be one of the more miserable winters in recent memory. Surely the fine people of Minnesota who have spent hard-earned money for season tickets will not have any regrets about leaving the controlled climate of a domed stadium in favor of the cruel whims of Mother Nature. On the flip side, the bitter-cold outdoor stadium could give the Vikings a distinct home-field advantage against teams not accustomed to playing in such conditions. Unfortunately for the Vikings, the Packers, whom they are playing for the 109th time, do not have an aversion to Arctic conditions. Pick: Packers Redskins (3-7) at 49ers (6-4) 4:25 p.m. Sunday Line: 49ers by 9 ½ Just when you thought Washington could not be more of a circus, Robert Griffin III criticized his teammates after last Sunday’s home loss to Tampa Bay. That led Coach Jay Gruden to make some critical remarks about Griffin. “I think it was a mistake on my part,” Gruden said Wednesday. “After a loss like that, we’re very disappointed in the way we played, and the question came up about how we played, and all that stuff from that. I just answered with the first thing that came to my mind, and sometimes the first thing that comes to your mind isn’t the smartest thing. It wasn’t the right thing to do on my part.” Pick: 49ers Jaguars (1-9) at Colts (6-4) 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Colts by 14 After a 42-20 loss to the Patriots in which running back Ahmad Bradshaw broke his leg and was lost for the season, Indianapolis is looking to get back on track. Jacksonville should be just what the doctor ordered in that regard. The Colts, who had won five games in a row before Week 11, have won their last four meetings against the Jaguars. Though Jacksonville has shown improvement at times, the Jaguars have been snakebit by turnovers, with 22, second most in the N.F.L. If they can limit the giveaways and control the ball, and if the defensive line can put some pressure on Andrew Luck, they stand a chance, however slim. Pick: Colts Bengals (6-3-1) at Texans (5-5) 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Texans by 1 ½ Before each game, Cincinnati fans must wonder, “Which Andy Dalton is going to show up today?” Will it be the poised, calm quarterback who completed more than 70 percent of his passes in Week 11 at New Orleans, one of the N.F.L.'s most hostile environments? Or will it be the panicked, confused-looking quarterback who completed 10 of 33 pass attempts for 86 yards with three interceptions against Cleveland the previous week? Houston defensive end J. J. Watt may factor slightly into that equation. Quarterback Ryan Mallett looked good running the Texans’ up-tempo offense in Week 11 against the same Browns defense that gave Dalton fits. “He understood the rhythm that we wanted to play,” Texans Coach Bill O’Brien said. “He had performed that well in practice. When we continually saw that week to week, we knew that he was a guy that when he got into the game, that he would know how we wanted to play.” Pick: Texans Buccaneers (2-8) at Bears (4-6) 1 p.m. Sunday Line: Bears by 6 Any disgruntled Bears fans perhaps longing for the days of Lovie Smith should be remedied of that feeling upon seeing Smith’s woeful Tampa Bay team take the field in Chicago. The Bears are bad. The Buccaneers are worse. Pick: Bears Rams (4-6) at Chargers (6-4) 4:05 p.m. Sunday Line: Chargers by 4 ½ Can we call this the “Which Team Is Moving to L.A.?” bowl? The St. Louis and San Diego franchises appear to be the clear favorites to relocate in the near future. Maybe move this matchup to a neutral field and force the losers to pack their stuff and head to Hollywood. At the very least, that would probably make for a more entertaining game. Pick: Chargers Jets (2-8) at Bills (5-5) 7 p.m. Monday The Bills offered $10 per hour and tickets to this game (which on Thursday was rescheduled from Sunday and moved to Detroit) to anyone willing to dig out Ralph Wilson Stadium from under several feet of snow. This did not sit well with some. “If the Buffalo Bills were truly that dedicated to the community they serve, they would offer residents $10/hour to help dig out their neighbors who can’t help themselves,”  Buffalo defensive end Mario Williams heeded that call; he helped the former Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, who is recovering from cancer treatments, dig out his home from under the snow. Pick: bills Ravens (6-4) at Saints (4-6) 8:30 p.m. Monday Line: Saints by 3 After not having lost a home game with Coach Sean Payton on the sideline since 2010, New Orleans has lost two in a row, and panic and frustration have begun to set in. The boo birds have surfaced in the Superdome, even for Drew Brees, the closest thing to royalty in New Orleans outside of the heads of Mardi Gras krewes. One Saints streak that remains intact, however, is their 14 straight home wins playing in prime time. Baltimore and Denver are the only teams the Saints have failed to beat during the Payton/Brees era. Further, the Ravens are the only team Brees has never beaten in his career; he’s 0-3 against them. That astounded Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs. “I don’t believe that,” Suggs said. “His numbers speak for itself.” One Baltimore player who is looking forward to Monday night is wide receiver Steve Smith. But it’s not because he has traditionally played well against the Saints, having accumulated just under 100 catches and 1,500 receiving yards in 23 games against them. Rather, Smith loves the prime-time spotlight. “I get excited,” he said. “Family members get to see you play. Ex-girlfriends that wish they didn’t dump you are questioning themselves right now. It’s fun. It’s kind of true. That’s why I’m not on Facebook.” Pick: Saints
