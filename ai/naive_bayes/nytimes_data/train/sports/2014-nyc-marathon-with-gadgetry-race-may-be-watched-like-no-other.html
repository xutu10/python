With Gadgetry, New York Marathon May Be Watched Like No Other
New York City Marathon officials are aiming to make the event the most advanced in the world, as far as gee-whiz gadgetry goes.

 This year’s  It may also be the most monitored race ever, with a phalanx of tracking technology and cameras used by organizers, city and federal officials, and private companies in the wearable-technology boom. “Our objective is to be the most technologically advanced marathon in the world,” said Peter Ciaccia, the chief production officer for New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon. “We can take this data and have fun with it.” Expanded big-screen televisions throughout the course will show not only footage of the race, as they have in the past, but also facts and statistics showing how runners have flowed over the course, Ciaccia said. “We have had the data, but we haven’t used it as much,” he added.    Marathon organizers track runners’ times at every mile split and every five kilometers of the course, roughly 1.6 million pieces of unique data, Ciaccia said. Such tracking will further alleviate the rare and eccentric cheating attempts and may be shared with runners in the future who are hoping to gain better insight into their race performance. “We’re not at a level where we’re collecting step-by-step GPS data that a Garmin or FitBit would collect,” Ciaccia said. “But that’s not far away. We’re creating a concept of a runner cloud.” For years, the Road Runners and other large marathon organizers have offered services that allow friends, family and fans of the race to follow runners online or on their cellphones by punching in bib numbers. This year, Tata Consultancy Services, an information-technology company based in India,  Working out of a room in Central Park, the radio communications center is “air-traffic control for us,” Ciaccia said. In a manner similar to a taxi dispatch center, officials there use tracking data to monitor the flow of runners and whether things like extra brooms, water or medical support are needed. Bottlenecks at the finish line are also monitored to prevent clogging. “We’ve used some of this before, but now it’s more robust,” Ciaccia said. “There’s more density to it. We can see through our data how many folks per minute are crossing key points.” Officials can also monitor whether a runner has been in a medical station for a long period, which may trigger a call for extra support. At the finish line, there will be four different clocks for four different waves for the first time. Ciaccia said the race hoped to expand that feature to other checkpoints in the future.
