The Brazilian great Pelé is expected to make a “quick and full” recovery from a minor infection caused by a recent surgery to remove kidney stones, his manager said. Paul Kemsley, Pelé’s manager, said in a statement that reports about the deterioration of Pelé’s condition and about his going into intensive care “were greatly exaggerated.” “He was relocated to a special area of the hospital for privacy purposes only, because an overwhelming number of visitors prevented him from getting the necessary care and treatment,” he said. “He is expected to make a quick and full recovery.” The Albert Einstein hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, released a statement earlier Thursday saying that Pelé, 74, was transferred to a “special care” unit after his condition became unstable. The statement created a scare in Brazil, with local news media widely reporting that Pelé’s condition had worsened.
