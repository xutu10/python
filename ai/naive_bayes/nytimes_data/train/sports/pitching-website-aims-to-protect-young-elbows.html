Pitching Website Aims to Protect Young Elbows
Alarmed by the surge in Tommy John surgery, Major League Baseball and USA Baseball have set up a website that offers guidelines on pitching usage and injury prevention.

The last baseball season started with a flurry of injured elbows and ended with Madison Bumgarner firing 68 pitches on two days’ rest to clinch the World Series for the San Francisco Giants. For people who specialize in repairing damaged arms — and preventing future problems — it was a mixed message. “I was thinking, ‘He’s a 25-year-old stud, an elite pitcher, and it’s the World Series — so you can expect that,’ ” said Dr. James Andrews, the orthopedic surgeon for many prominent athletes. “The problem is, young kids see that and they think they can do it. But most of those kids aren’t going to be elite pitchers with the right genetics. They can’t get away with that.” Andrews added, “That doesn’t work for the masses, and that’s part of the education process.” Major League Baseball and USA Baseball — the governing body for amateurs — took a step in that process Tuesday by starting a website,  The site gives recommendations for pitch counts and rest, tailored to specific ages, while explaining risk factors, warning signs and all manner of questions related to Tommy John elbow reconstruction surgery. That was the procedure that knocked out Matt Harvey, Jose Fernandez, Ivan Nova, Patrick Corbin, Kris Medlen, Matt Moore, Jarrod Parker and others for most or all of last season. Most of those pitchers tore their ulnar collateral ligaments early in the season, and as the summer went on, the rate of such injuries declined. But according to M.L.B., surgeries have increased in the last three years to about 25 to 30 per year — up from 15 to 20 before that — and the real trouble usually starts much earlier. “The problems we see in professional baseball don’t start when they sign their contracts,” said Dr. Gary Green, M.L.B.’s medical director. “A lot of the problems start when they’re younger. We’ve decided that we can’t just focus on the major leaguers and minor leaguers. We have to get an earlier start on this.” A baseball spokesman said Commissioner Bud Selig expressed concerns about the rash of injuries in April and coordinated with the labor relations department to convene a panel of experts. Green and Andrews are part of a 12-person Pitch Smart advisory board that includes the Yankees’ doctor, Chris Ahmad, one of five team physicians represented. Green said that diagnosing elbow injuries was like seeking a cause for a heart attack: The culprit could be high cholesterol, smoking, family history or something else. Without a definitive cure, so to speak, for torn U.C.L. ligaments, it made sense to create a clearinghouse for the best available research. “This website is putting out facts, not just to scare people, but to give them things to protect themselves and still continue playing baseball,” said Dr. Stan Conte, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ vice president for medical services. “This isn’t: ‘If you throw hard, your arm’s going to fall off,’ ” Conte said. “But you have to know what risks you’re taking by throwing over 100 innings at age 12, or going on back-to-back days, or throwing more than the pitch limits.” Conte has been researching public perception of Tommy John surgery through surveys given to baseball reporters. Even within that group, he said, there were still some who believed in persistent myths, like the average recovery time of 12 months; the rise in velocity after surgery; and the propriety of having the surgery even without a torn ligament. “A lot of people think you can do that surgery without the injury,” Green said. “Change the ligament like you’re changing a light bulb.” In one of the videos on the site, Andrews addresses some of the misconceptions about the surgery, which he said has risen nearly tenfold among youth pitchers in the last 14 years. In 2000, Andrews said, most of his Tommy John patients were professionals. Now, most are amateurs. He described a discouraging morning routine of visiting operating rooms filled with adolescents nursing serious arm injuries. Curveballs, Andrews said, should not be thrown until a pitcher is old enough to shave — meaning that he has gone through puberty and has enough neuromuscular control to throw the pitch with proper mechanics. He said the danger zone for a developing pitcher’s fastball was only about 80 miles an hour. “The radar gun should be outlawed,” Andrews said, “or at least de-emphasized.” Of course, with every pitch accompanied by a speed reading on major league broadcasts, the radar gun is here to stay. Young pitchers know that high velocity can lead to a bonus from a major league team or a college scholarship. Conte acknowledged the predicament and said it would naturally be hard for a parent to tell a child to dial back such an athletic gift. “But I think we can give them some pause in how many innings they throw,” Conte said. “Say you’re throwing 80 miles an hour at age 12. Maybe you want to back him down and not put him at risk when he’s 14.” Andrews said that while Little League Baseball had been a leader in developing guidelines for pitchers, the various year-round leagues and showcases were generally disorganized about protecting pitchers and keeping records. The committee, he said, is considering several research projects, including a national registry of youth pitching injuries; a widespread biomechanical study of youth mechanics; an online certification program for youth coaches; and so on. For now, at least, there is a synthesized message, and a commitment to reversing a troubling trend. “Baseball, of course, is our national pastime,” Andrews said, “and it’s supposed to be a safe and healthy sport.”
