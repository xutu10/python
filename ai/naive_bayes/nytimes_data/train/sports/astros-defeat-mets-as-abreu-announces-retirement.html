Chris Carter and Robbie Grossman doubled off Torres, and Matt Dominguez capped the outburst with a run-scoring single. Kevin Chapman (2-0) got two outs, Tony Sipp tossed two perfect innings and the Astros snapped a three-game skid by winning for the third time in 10 games. Chad Qualls worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his 19th save. Before the game, Bobby Abreu, 40, a reserve outfielder and pinch-hitter with the Mets, announced he planned to retire. A two-time All-Star, Abreu has a .291 career batting average with 288 home runs, 1,363 runs batted in and 2,469 hits.
