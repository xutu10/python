At Barclays Center, Islanders Fans Discover Seats With Obstructed Views
Some Islanders fans found that the view from their seats at Barclays Center was obstructed when they arrived for Friday night’s preseason game against the Devils.

John and Nizzette Conlon and their two sons, all  “What is this?” Nizzette said. John just laughed. Their seats for Friday night’s preseason game against the  The Conlons were not alone in their plight while attending the Islanders’ only visit this season to Barclays Center, their future home. The view from several hundred other seats at one end of the rink was also obstructed, though arena officials said many of those would not be offered for sale when the team starts play there next year. “The seats with horrible views, they are off the manifest,” said Brett Yormark, the chief executive officer of Barclays Center, which is also home to the Nets. Yormark said that about 400 of the 15,795 seats that will be sold next season for hockey would have some obstruction. Those tickets will be clearly marked. “We’re upfront about it,” Yormark added. “Fans knew the seats are obstructed when they bought them.” The question is whether fans will travel from Long Island and the five boroughs to fill the rest of the two-year-old arena when the Islanders arrive after playing 43 years at the now-dilapidated Nassau Coliseum. Though the Coliseum is ancient by modern sports standards, longtime fans emphasize that there is not a bad seat in the house. But the move to Brooklyn is meant to give the long-struggling club an infusion of much-needed revenue and glamour. “We’re aiming to give N.H.L. hockey a strong presence in Brooklyn,” Yormark said. But Yormark did not share many specifics on which seats would be excluded when the Islanders arrive. A pregame walk at one end of the arena found far more than 400 seats with obstructed views. Seven sections had no view of the goal at one end of the building. Most seats in nine other sections had a view of the net, but not of the near corner of the rink. “When they built this place, did they not know they’d be playing hockey here?” Nizzette Conlon asked in exasperation. Actually, they did not. Frank Gehry’s original design for the arena accommodated hockey as well as basketball. But when he was replaced by SHoP Architects and the company now known as Aecom, the new, more compact design had room for the Nets, and basketball, only. Hockey rinks are about 100 feet longer and 25 feet wider than basketball courts, leaving one end of the building with poor sightlines. For some fans, that was not a problem. “I purposely wanted to have a obstructed view seat because of the price,” said Steven Chatterton, 45, of Queens, who paid $15 to sit five rows up in Section 205, where he could not quite see the corner to the left of the net below. “I don’t mind having to stand up to see the whole rink. I just hope this price holds next season when they move for good.” Ryan Yuhas of Ronkonkoma, N.Y., said, “It’s not ideal, but it’s not awful.” Yuhas, 28, paid $40 to sit just a few rows off the ice in Section 29. But his view of the same net was hampered by bars of protective fencing above the Zamboni entrance. Last year, when the Islanders played their only previous game at Barclays, members of the news media were given a tour of the sparkling new arena by Yormark and the developer Bruce C. Ratner, and Charles Wang, the Islanders’ mercurial owner. But after the game, many fans complained about the obstructed sightlines at the end of the rink. This time there was much less hoopla. Very little promotion preceded the game. Wang was not available Friday. The journey for him has been especially arduous since he spent many years battling Nassau County over proposed plans to keep the team on Long Island, where it began as an expansion franchise in 1972. He recently agreed to sell his majority stake in the team to the businessmen Jonathan Ledecky and Scott Malkin by the 2016-17 season. On Friday, with attendance at 11,823, the obstructed seats were not much of an issue. Fans moved to better seats. The Conlons moved down to the bottom row of their section and leaned over the railing, right above the top of the glass at the end of the rink. “But what if the Islanders make the playoffs?” asked Greg Ferrone, an Islanders fan from Merrick, N.Y., who sat in an obstructed-view seat in Section 102 with his son, Matteo. “This place will be full, and people will have to sit in these seats. It’s going to be a major problem.” Would he pay for such seats if the Islanders made the playoffs? Ferrone was asked. “Yes, because I’m an Islanders fan,” he said. That was the answer Yormark was probably hoping for.
